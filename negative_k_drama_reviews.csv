tt16549178,"All participants in this drama, both actors and directors, understood that in making such a decision, there is a huge risk of injury and death of the animal. Apologies are easy to say, it is impossible to restore life to a living being. Drama cancellation and litigation is the perfect solution for all of them. Cruel, but deserved.For such a company, using computer graphics is not a problem at all, but it is clear that someone is especially greedy and continues to exploit animals for their stupid purposes. The question is, how many such projects were there before this drama and how many animals were harmed on their set for the sake of a few ""spectacular"" minutes? An animal died, footage of animal abuse was included in the episode, and the film crew just apologized .. do you think this is normal??",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"I don't think this show deserves to see the light of day. It wasn't worth the animal abuse that they condoned for a short shot in the show. Not only did they tie a real horse up and force it to land on its head, but the horse unfortunately died shortly after. If you're considering watching this show... don't. No show is worth the torture and death of an animal, especially not this one. There are many dramas that follow this unoriginal plot like this one that don't partake in cruelty like this.I hope this show gets cancelled, and they people behind this suffer the consequences.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,Don't support animal abuse in films or any other form of entertainment. The poor horse involved in this film endured horrific treatment which led to the unnecessary death of this innocent animal. They actually wired the horses legs together to make it fall and killed it. This is just beyond belief. Why was this allowed to happen? This is not entertainment.,negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"Watch behind the scenes. See how few of the set guys hold the rope and kill the horse in the set. Imagine, you have one job, its easy, to help the production, and you have brain as well. You know that what you are doing will kill the horse, and you are killing a horse with your own hands. I wonder the psychology of the authority who decided this. No movie set should have the courage to kill an animal.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"The tv series itself is great. It's like a Korean Game of Thrones - many characters and parties fighting for the throne, each has bad side and good side. Complex characters, great writing and storyline. It's like the dark truth of history, not a fairytale-like story like many other historical kdramas. This is definitely the best Korean tv show I have seen!All the complaints and bad ratings are because of the animal abuse scandal. One horse died during filming, sadly. While this is very unfortunate and I hope the responsible ones were fired and the necessary actions were taken to avoid such abuse in the future, I don't think it has anything to do with the quality of the series itself. There were probably a few production workers who work with the horses, they made this terrible mistake. But there are hundreds of others, innocent people, who work on this production! The great actors, the script writers, the costume designers, the set designers, the cameramen, etc! Don't degrade their work too just because a few others made that terrible mistake! It's as if you canceled the great movie The Pianist because of the director Polanski's scandals. You can't cancel or degrade a whole production, which is the great work of hunderds of good people, because of the scandal of a few people.",positive,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"In the 21 century,to not use the computer graphic,and still kill an innocent animal...I can't believe. That was the last straw. I'm looking for watching Cdrsma from now on. I can't believe in a high developed country as South Korea ...üò≥üëéüèªüëéüèª",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"The series was great. Every episode of the series was wonderful and exciting and the actor of the main character ""Joo Sang Wook"" was great in it. His acting was very cool and impressive and I liked him very much. His facial expression and acting in different scenes made me think that he is a versatile actor. He's a really talented actor. Definitely, he's been in the industry for so long, but he's still able to deliver amazing performances.And about the story of the series, because it was completely based on Korean history and historical facts, it was very attractive and exciting to me.It was such a touching series
Thanks to all the creators of this series.",positive,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"All actors and crew know animals are killed to make this show. Just look at the poor video of them killing a horse for just one scene. Purposefully tripping it. It died a week later, but looks extremely injured so therefore it must have suffered for a long while. This show needs to be banned and and all participants jailed or fined. Disgusting.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,The show overall is tasteless. It's not only tasteless but they killed a horse while filming. Absolutely terrible. Whoever came up with the idea to tie the horse should get fired and should go to jail for animal cruelty. Disgusting.,negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"It might have a decent story line but I will never know because I will never watch something that chose violence, abuse and neglegence of an animals welfare for a mere scene. I am an avid fan of Korean production but this is just far too much...",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"I totally agree with rkpmthk's observation. I really wanted to see this and I started watching it at a Korean friend's place - couldn't continue. Animal cruelty is the most abhorrent thing to me and this just turned my stomach; then again, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"Hi Angelique, and whoever supports this show and the ones behind it, if you consider killing a horse on PURPOSE is a mistake, then you're no less as sick and disgusting as the perpetrators who commited this vile and awful act.Kami had his legs tied up with wire, several people pulled on those wires as soon as he started running with the sole purpose of tripping him, Kami ended up falling (as they wanted) and breaking his neck, nobody there cared about him as he lay there in what I would imagine was excruciating pain, he died a week later due to his injuries, they killed him for entertainment, he was only around 5 years old, he still had 20-25 years ahead of him, but they killed him on purpose for what? A couple minutes in a TV show?Btw this was not the first time KBS had done this, this is just the one that they were caught red handed in doing, so no, this was not an accident, a MURDER was commited, and your cold heartedness in supporting the murderers really shows what kind of evil you are.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,The prior review by angelique says everything I think about this complex intelligent work of genius. I have seen probably 40 Kdramas of which most have been excellent. With gorgeous boys (thank you!) and gals. And clever tricks.This isn't that. It's deeply serious with no easy answers about who is good or bad. It's a very complicated story that will demand your attention. Don't miss it.,positive,"Drama, History"
tt26770113,"At first I thought this will be a horror series. Like a proper fictional story where there is a zombie outbreak but it is already been tamed (much like the end of shaun of the dead) and these characters join this game show where the have to do challenges while also escaping the zombies (basically squid game but with zombies). And it'll be shot much like we are watching a reality show.But alas, the show is basically just role play.Knowing these people are actually safe made it hard to believe in it. As well as them unable to truly hurt the zombies (since they are just real people), makes the whole thing kinda stupid (not that I endorsed violence but it is like watching people do tag and run but with zombies).Dex is the star of the show for sure, but it also made the others looked incompetent by a lot.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Interested in watching this at first because it said to be unscripted like a reality show but this is probably 98% scripted like a comedy zombie drama.There's this scene where all the cast inside a van tried to escape from the zombies, and they hit a zombie with the van and they're all passed out inside the van from the impact, all 6 of them passed out LOL
This is so far from being a reality show hahahaDex and lee si young are adorable thou!Solid effort for all their acting,
Would actually so much better if they do it inside 1 big shopping centre without any script like survival show.Overall worth watching if you want a little bit of laugh.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"I watched the first episode, I like the starting point, all make sense, love the action which add up more action element vibe like a real apocalypse. Second episode also good, all make sense, like the thriller it gives etc. The ending quite questionable but understandable.But the third episode made me stop watching. Like it just doesn't make sense, like, how come one person can fall down, being pulled by a bunch and still not getting bitten? This is still acceptable since im her fan as well, but the fact that that other guy who could just climb the tower over and over again, couldn't jump over that short thingy like???? Hello? It just doesn't make sense. The scene is so obviously dragging like everything drags just to ensure the one should die, dies, and the one who shouldn't die survive. Plus, isn't both second and third person in both episodes DIED due to the same reason? Like come on, it just quite repetitive and doesn't make sense man.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"A zombie reality show in a so-called ""unscripted"" setting is a recipe for disaster. I couldn't take it seriously when it was painfully obvious to me that the cast were just acting like they were seeing zombies in real life saying ""they'll die"" and stuff like that. It felt like the show was belittling my intelligence. And it also made the zombies acting seem fake and not scary.I can't believe Netflix halted production of a brilliant series like All Of Us Are Dead season 2 and also Kingdom 3 for this, just because this reality show needed the zombie art and choreography team of the former 2 shows. Netflix should better stick with producing zombie fictious series like AOUAD which has proved to be one of the best in the world.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Lets be honest, South Korea produces the best zombie shows and movies. As a huge fan of the zombie genre I spent no time downloading the whole show on netflix so I could watch it on my vacation. I spent the first 15 to 30 minutes figuring out what was going on. I completely lost it when they mentioned it was ""unscripted"". Sure there was no script to follow but the whole show was made to look like a reality show where the characters have no clue what is going on when it is very obvious they are in on the show. The very convenient cut between the episodes gives them enough time for makeup and prop setup. Now I was stuck on a vacation with nothing else to watch except for this. The more I watched the more I felt I was losing my braincells. There was nothing to look forward to. The characters are real life celebrities that had nothing to offer. There were no stakes. Just a bunch of fake zombies, and fake characters.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"They could have just tell the contestants that they are surviving a make believe zombie world and inform the viewers that they are participating in some quests with ""zombies"", rather than lying to the viewers that no information is given and making us believe any of this is unscripted(I hope for anyone's intelligence nobody actually believes this).It's painfully obvious when the contestants are pretending to be terrified while the production crew continues to film them in camera close ups and continue to keep audio in check literally a few feet away from them, this show is an insult to any viewers intelligence.If you wish to sate your curiosity to find out how stupid all these are go ahead, but I can almost guarantee you that you will drop this show within the first 30 minutes.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"I like many of the Asian shows on Netflix. But not this one. Supposed to be unscripted, that is the most unbelievable part of this show. Abysmal dubbing. Terrible acting.The escapees need fuel. They stop at a gas station and the driver gets out to refuel. Zombies appear and attack the driver. The cast, inside the un-fuelled vehicle, work out that the zombies react to sound. They decide to get out of the vehicle to throw articles around on the forecourt. Oil cans, water drums, bins etc. This should draw the zombies away from the vehicle making it possible to fuel it. Each person that throws the items, to draw the zombies away, run around screeching and screaming. Why would they not just throw a trash can, shut their mouths and move on to the next noisy item ? Pure idiocy.By now, in episode 1, I had really had enough of the terrible dubbing, camera work, and acting.Please let the zombies win.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Netflix has abandoned some really good zombie series over the past few years, but they come up with this trash now.You seriously need a low IQ to enjoy this. Case and point:The bad guys lock up a girl in a cage by just shoving some zombies around, but the good guys need a ridiculous plan with an RC car to free her.At another point the ""reporter"" character is shown in front of a wall of firearms (AK's and AR's), yet he proceeds to train the good guys on how to use a ""potato gun"" instead.I don't know what they are thinking. They have some great zombie series that they just dropped and expect us to like this. Give me more. Daybreak, All of us are Dead, Black Summer, and Sweet Home instead of this brain dead garbage.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"This was a great idea and the producers were clearly did their best. First, the good points, and there are a number of them:1) Zombie effects were done quite well. This makes sense since it was apparently the same team as ""All of Us are Dead"" (hurry up with the next season!)2) The storyline -- clearly difficult with an unscripted show -- was done really well, and the producers were clearly thinking cleverly while shooting went on to react to events and finished with a neat little denouement.3) Some episodes' challenges were good and realistic for a zombie scenario -- finding items, rescuing survivors, finding working transport, etc., were done well and they were able to put little wrinkles on it with the unscripted nature that a scripted show would not have had.4) Each contestant's character showed through their actions and narrative subtitles. This was good at inspiring fondness for some characters and dislike for others.5) The contestants were clearly immersed enough to do things which hold some actual risk. Not hugely dangerous, but think things like jumping over barriers and climbing fairly high objects without nets/wires/etc., and ""fighting"" zombies (no stabbings or hammer strikes to the head, but definitely hard pushes, throws, etc.).6) Tsuki is adorable.Now, the bad points:1) Obviously all the contestants knew they weren't in an actual zombie situation. Most were still able to act as though they were, but Rong-Chul in particular could not suppress a grin even during scenes that should have been intensely terrifying (well, except one that seemed to really shock him). Additionally, sometimes many of the actors were either overcome by silliness or made decisions they quite clearly would not have made during an actual zombie apocalypse.2) While many of the challenges were pretty good, a couple of them also got into some silliness. Quiet (nonzombie) portions of the show also looked a lot more like variety talk shows than any kind of drama.3) The survivors all being celebrities at themselves was a bit weird (at one point, a survivor even asks why there were so many celebrities clustered into the same country grocery store). It was even weirder when they tried to use their celebrity status to convince others they were trustworthy.4) The presence of ""NPCs"" who served to guide events was a bit distracting. Early episodes handled this pretty well to do the initial setup, but some of the later NPC interactions were sort of blunt.Overall, I enjoyed the show, though, and would look forward to another season.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Man!! I was so excited to watch this series. I literally waited a whole month for it to come out and now since it came out oh my God it is the worst webseries I have ever seen in my whole life. The camera keeps on turning left and right and it looks so fake. It looks nothing like a webseries of 2023 I am so disappointed I can't believe why Netflix would even buy these kind of webseries when they know people just gonna, give zero ratings so I suggest you don't waste your time. Thank you. I hope somebody from the movie is reading all these reviews and they can try to make a better movie or a web series next time. Better luck next time.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"A few episodes in, and i like this somewhat improvised reality show. From their reactions, etc., it seemed to me the contestants were told they'd start out being on a reality dating-type show but that ""something"" would happen and they would then be on their own.I can't imagine that this is any more than minimally scripted, because the producers obviously spent a lot of time setting up the various locations and situations, and it doesn't make any sense that they would do that for people who are just reading lines. From their reactions as the dating show starts to go sideways they seemed genuinely taken by surprise.The ""something"" turns out to be a zombie apocalypse, which they are supposed to somehow survive. They travel around together to complete various escape-related tasks (and try to avoid being taken out by the zombies). You can also tell the zombies are really into the concept.For imported shows like this, i much prefer the original audio accompanied by subtitles. The voiceover is kind of bland, and doesn't really match what was very likely more honest reactions to what's going on. Would recommend for fans of reality (and, sure, zombie stuff too)",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"This show is funny and ridiculous. These people are so stupid. Fukutomi Tsuki is super hot and worth watching for her. But seriously they are so stupid. They said for example in the first episode pumping gas you have to hold it. Yet if you look at the handle you put the metal part down and the handle will pump itself. The guy making noise is an idiot because he didn't bother getting the key for the car first. I mean seriously this is hilariously stupid. But that's what it is supposed to be. It is supposed to be a stupid reality show where zombies are real. I love how they put digital things over the heads of zombies and people. It makes it like a crew is editing everything as it is happening like a real reality show.If zombies did happen you never let the child bearing women risk their lives. You have to eventually populated the world. Doctors, nurses, vets, engineers, farmers and people who know a ton about everything are all the most important people in a zombie apocalypse. The sound guy not so much haha. But seriously never make the child bearing women out their lives at risk. However everyone does need to pull their own weight and help the group.These people are utter idiots. It's not hard. The grocery store episode for example. You simply block the doors with chains, rope or carts stacked up. Then you clear the store of zombies. Then you are perfectly safe and they don't have to sneak around like idiots and trying to decide who to pair up with. Just utter idiots. Block the doors then gather the stuff. Simple not hard. If you have any brains at all you will survive a zombie apocalypse. Stupid people are the first to die.The one thing that annoys me the most about this show is they are so stupid. None of them get weapons. They had bolt cutters but then left them. They had tons of opportunities to get weapons but they simply don't. I mean seriously this is why they are losing people and getting caught. Also NEVER drink from someone you don't know. Or at least have two people not eat and drink for a few hours first. Eat in shifts. But seriously weapons are bats, hammers, anything blunt or sharp. I mean the bolt cutters are a weapon. Scissors are weapons. Hammer is a weapon. Heck a broom handle is a weapon and you can duct tape a knife with it. Seriously always have a weapon and armor if you can. Even wearing multiple layers of clothes can help. Especially leather and denim. Hockey or football gear can help.The show is funny but seriously it is super frustrating because they are just so stupid. When they walk together because their legs are tied up is ridiculous. Why didn't they take the rope and tape off of themselves. Also the barn with the zombie grandma just burn the place down with the candles it would have given them all a massive distraction. It's just so ridiculous how they all haven't died yet. The only one who would survive is the special forces guy and the sexy model should also live. She can help repopulate the planet haha.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"As soon as it was released, I rushed to download all the episodes at the same time. After watching the first fifteen minutes of the first episode, I regretted wasting my wifi on it. Even if this was some sort of game and the contestants were improvising their next moves, it was horrible.The contestants were annoying. (Unnecessary screams, laughing even in serious situations, keep attracting zombies.)
Bad quality and production. (The same scene would repeat three times in different angles.) Which was also annoying.To be fair, I would give episode 5 my best review. It was the only episode that I enjoyed and the only hilarious episode that made me laugh. So yes; look forward to it.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

I am watching with my husband until he told me shall we stop, cause is very lame, I say ok. Let's stop here.

People complain all the time how these reality shows are scripted, but we are supposed to believe this zombie crap? This is so stupid I feel like it should be taken off the streaming platform. Watching something this cringe really does make you physically uncomfortable. I don't know how anyone could make it past 10 minutes of this garbage.

how can netflix cancel we are dead to produce such a bad series (zombierso).. Please, I hope they do not produce a second season since it is very bad in terms of acting, the plot of the series, the zombies are not zombies, it is very badly acted, The degree of acting is so bad..
they should release another type of zombie series, this is not dirty, what they do is waste time..ATT: defender and lover of the zombie apocalypse.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Every character, zombies included, had a radio and battery pack on the back of their belt visible throughout the entire show. It makes sense the main characters, thinking they were on a TV show at the start, may have had an excuse to wear one but the zombies? How did the main characters not see and comment on that?Most characters were wearing a jacket or something baggie to try and hide it, but when you watch the so-called zombies stretching, trying to reach someone on top of a car, they were clearly visible.I wanted to believe and get sucked into the story but couldn't find any way to invest in this show once I saw that. I can't go higher than 2/10 = cringey!",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Lets make one thing clear, THIS is a game show, this is not an epic story with high stakes, no, this, is a game show. The survivors are contestants, you lose when you die. Those are the stakes.I dont BLAME ANYONE for thinking otherwise because the show does a terrible job of presenting this fact and i had to look it up because i was confused. It also doesnt help that the actors aka the players, i THINK were encouraged or told to make characters out of themselves, to try and have a story going on of their own making,This is where i think the show messes up, its trying to have a cake and eat it too, they dont play it straight enough. All this has is a psuedo narrative dissonance where the show acts like this is a real drama, but then the contestants are laughing smiling another moment. They really should of just dropped it. Have the only story being setting up the scenario in question, and treat it like a 100% game show.That being said, as a game show it is pretty neat, theres very little guidance meaning the players basically get told the objectives, and work everything else from there! Sometimes not even that and have to figure out the objectives on the fly.

From the first episode, they all were wasting energies running and screaming while accomplishing simple quests. They'd have die of exhaustion from all those running and screaming around in real situation, if not from zombie bites. That's not how you survive an apocalypse. If the show was really unscripted, then I'll have to say they are the dumbest surviver ever with lowest iq.

tt26770113,"I gave it an 8 mostly for DEX (fans of DEX know who he is) and for comedy value as I found it extremely funny from the very beginning. It can't be serious but I've seen some great acting amongst the zombies - it is advertised as unscripted per se, but we all know it is fake so it comes out as hilarious. The one actor contestant with the hat with the ear flaps is laughing the whole time - even he can't help it. Dex is playing his cool self as usual and figures out how to escape the zombies in an early quest using his UDT soldier experience. Am kind of wondering if it isn't treated kind of like a mystery dinner where each contestant is given their roll to play in advance, but there is no script. Have no idea about the producing but each episode is a different quest (gas station, grocery store, etc). Will have to see how this ends - 8 episodes in all.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

Seriously, I have watched enough zombie shows that I would weapon up because I'd need to.

The incorporation of zombies adds a thrilling twist that I find absolutely captivating. I wish I could be a part of this project. However, the authenticity is where I hit a snag. Many reality shows feel fake, and even though Zombieverse claims to be unscripted, it's hard to ignore the moments that feel staged. The fear factor falls short when the victims don't appear as genuinely terrified as someone facing a true zombie apocalypse. A fantastic idea held back by its execution.""",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

I get that they want it to be a mix of variety show and drama but sorry, this one is a fail. I Even Running Man is more unscripted than this one and actually entertaining to watch.Honestly, it would be less annoying if the cast could acknowledge that this a show but still put all of their effort into solving the problems and fighting the zombies, just like Running Man or Busted.I couldn't finish the first ep because of how cringy the plot and cast were. Cannot believe Netflix Korea would put out something like this and think it would be great. They could have just turned it into another zombie drama and I would totally watch it. Overall, totally not recommend.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"This show had a lot of promise as it was doing something revolutionary in combining zombie Apocalypse with a game show. So it is pretty confusing considering they keep claiming its unscripted but its a game show with quests but its also being filmed as if its not a game show at the same time.So the plot of this show is all these korean celebs from all walks of life such as female boxer, male baseball player were auditioning for some reality tv event but then a zombie apocalypse breaks out on set & in the town and our celeb participants are forced to try & survive together by completing quests like a game show.This would become revolutionary tv if it succeeds but sadly the things that makes this fresh n new is exactly what is making this fail. Its just to complex that even the director & zombie actors & the celebs themselves keeps confusing themselves over their own rules. A good example is that the celebs & the narrator constantly reminded viewers that the zombies are blind but they have heightened hearing & are attracted to sound. So now the problem begins cause everytime they are beside the zombies, behind the zombies & infront of them the cast would all talk & issue commands to each other but miraculously the zombies cant ever hear them lmao but then if they stood very still n lifted their arm ever so slowly n slightly suddenly the zombies are rushing them full on lol.Another issue is none of them fights back or tries to kill the zombies cause well.. unless you script the actions then u cant actually hurt the zombie actors purposely... so if u cant do kill or hurt them then that means this show is scripted & that alone already ruins n contradicts the premise of this show being unscripted.Also theirs been no mentions of needing to go washroom, or using cell phones to call for help, or even any signs of worry for their own family members back home lol so that also just contradicts openly the narrative that its unscripted. Even worse is the female cast constantly screaming is becoming so annoying... like the Tsuki chick thats a kpop singer, shes so cute but her voice constantly screaming high pitch is driving me insane, its like the equivalent of someone scratching their nails across the chalkboards. They constantly let viewers know the zombies attracted to sound but at every moment a zombie is near the female cast screams constantly as they run or try to stealthily sneak by lmao. Honestly the way they keep screaming u would think they were auditioning for some Japanese Adult Film lmao.Anyway this show is a huge fail all due to how complex they designed the plot of the show, I dont think even the zombie cast n director & the celeb participants understand fully the clear boundary lines they trying too display between :
Game show VS a fictional zombie apocalypse Vs Real Zombie apocalypse.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"I simply did not appreciate what was being chased here. First, I detest reality shows in general, so when I figured out what was happening, it was a double-sided turn off...which is exactly what I did after episode 6. I gave it the ole school yard try, but labored over each episode I watched until making my decision to turn it off. Others have given synopsis about the details of how the ""show"" lays out, so I'll give some content comments instead. Notice there was no ""second.""-THERE IS NO GORE IN THIS! Ok...in all honesty, when the first episode came on, there were a couple glimpses of blood, so I thought we might be in good shape, but there is very little either violence or gore after the opening of the series. Sadly, Tsuki's screaming permeated the show, which was violence to my ears.no bad language, no drugs, NO NUDITY.If you were looking for a new zombie idea to quench your thirst, this is NOT for you. If you love kawai, kitch, and Kardashian, give it a whirl.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"This show could have been good had they just said the actors knew it was a show. But the whole pretense is that they don't know it's a reality tv show (as they said in episode 1 that they won't disclose any more information to the actors). Though, this is not entirely convincing when they have close ups on the actors doing some things where it is very clear that a camera would have been all up in their face AND would have taken time to do so- meaning they would have had to stopped filming just to get these close-ups... For example, in episode 1 they must fuel up their car, so someone gets out of the car. As they do, we get a whole zoom in on them from bottom-up, front and back- as if they're some sort of character in a fighting game. When the whole show is revolved around the idea that an apocalypse is occurring in real-time, the reason for watching goes outside the window once you know they're just acting. Again, it wouldn't have been bad had they just said 'Ah, the actors know it's a reality tv show, but they must do everything they can to survive'. Again too, they say that what the actors do are completely unscripted, but they are literally guided on where to go and it's pretty obvious from there what they should do. For instance, episode 2 takes place in a grocery store. Gee, wonder what you could possibly do there except for- I don't know... get food and water. I wasn't expecting much, but still. Didn't think it would be this bad.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,I wrote this review from the experience of being zombie obsessed and watching a lot of zombie shows/ films.A lot of people have review bombed this because they didn't really understand it it seems.It's a clever concept I think: it brings together concepts from different genres of shows for quite an experimental comedy. I like how it explores ideas about tension created across different types of TV - and the way it parodies real zombie fiction from a different lens is unique and interesting.I enjoyed it overall - but it didn't hold my attention as well as it could have.I think it could have been better with a little more pacing.,neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"This is pretty bad.First of all I have nothing against these celebrities and they are not at fault for what is happening.Basicly it is a survival game. And if you solve the puzzles you survive , and move to a different location.The premise that the participants don't know what will happen is only half true. As they have to act some stuff out to.So beacause of all the different locations and the scenarios they have to solve ithis has turned out as a huge disappointment.The puzzles are not at all interesting. And even the solutions feel scripted. This is really clear at the supermarket parking lot.The safe area is a no enter zone for zombies. But it becomes clear the zombies are instructed to wander in the parking lot and nowhere else.This should be obvious from a directing standpoint but not from a viewers perspective.There is an abundance of camera's. This can be fine in non zombie moments. But there are too many in the zombie scenes as well.There is way more to sum up. Episode 6 is probably the worst in the theme. A big part of it shooting potatoes at mannequins. At the end of the traing. They askk what's the point . And exactly what's the point...
this seems more like a teambuilding trip than a zombieseries.There are great Korean zombie series. The best is kingdom,
Sweet home and all of us are dead are also pretty goed zombie series. There are a bunch more. Some very light hearted as well.Anyway this non scripted is the worst by a country mile.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

Obviously they do know that they're in a reality show and what they need to do to survive, otherwise they would harm the zombie-actors. But their reactions and characters seemed genuine to me. I found it really funny and interesting. It is a reality show, so you don't have to question their actions, it's not a movie nor a series. Some people didn't like the fact that the cast laughed and seemed to enjoy it, but I really liked that, because it made it more genuine for me. I think that it was really entertaining and I would like to see another season with different cast!",positive,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"I knew almost nothing about the show before I started watching it so I didn't have any particular expectations. Zombieverse is a fun watch if you have a good sense of humor. It's hilarious at times which is what I love about it. The main reason I gave it a chance was because I'm a huge horror fan especially when it comes to anything in the zombie category. That being said, fellow zombie fans will more than likely be disappointed in this series. It's corny and unrealistic especially when it comes to the zombies and the survival aspect of the show. Some of the characters are insufferable at times but if you can get passed the obnoxious unnecessary bits, it's entertaining. There's a bit of suspense in each episode, making it just exciting enough that I care to see what will happen next. Zombieverse as a whole is pretty ridiculous but it's meant to be lighthearted and not taken seriously so if you can accept that then you might find the show enjoyable. I like that it pokes fun at actual reality shows and celebrities / social media influencers. I don't mind zombie comedies as I'm a fan of Shaun Of The Dead (a dark comedy) and Z Nation (a dark comedy drama) and both take place in a zombie apocalypse type situation. If you're watching it purely for the zombie factor, Zombieverse leaves quite a bit to be desired. If there is a second season, perhaps it will be more satisfying in that sense. I will definitely watch it if there is another season. We're left with multiple unanswered questions at the end of season 1 so there is definitely potential for more. I personally hope the show doesn't get cancelled because I would like to see where it could go. The funny moments in this series make it worth continuing to watch because sometimes mindless tv is self care but I'm also interested to see some character development. There was a similar tv series from the UK about a fictional reality show / game show that takes place during a zombie outbreak. I think it was called Dead Set or something like that. Dead Set had more drama and action. Zombieverse is the more innocent, more animated / gregarious, Korean version of that show.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

I was hoping for an exciting and suspenseful series , and we got a series that was looking like they made it up as they went along. Absolutely no survival skills were to be seen , and no characters were likeable or interesting. I'm on episode four and I'm doubtful that I can make it through the series. It's like watching a train wreck on slow motion. The only reason to continue watching , is to see how incompetent they can get.

This is where I stopped watching the series, I gave it about 15 minutes into episode 2 to see if this zombie series would make some type of improvement but was meet with the same junk as the first episode, truly don't want to waste more time wasting watching this series, my recommendation is, wait for the next zombie TV or movie and hope for the best cause this ain't it!

The awesome points are in the zombie make-up, the location setting to support the stories, Dex's actions, the zombie scenes while they attack ppl, and the ship bus. Others are awful, especially the stories inside the show, as many Korean directors like to put many unnecessary dramas inside their works. It's the worst Netflix TV show ever on their platform.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"I was not impressed by this series at all. The writing was all over the place and it just felt so lazy. There are so many plot holes to anyone who pays attention to what's happening. Events happen that don't make sense and just overall the acting was so unbearable at times, it felt so awkward that I could barely watch. You can clearly see the multitude of times that the cast broke character, even if the script said they should laugh or not take a situation seriously, you could see how most of the cast just broke character. There were only 2, maybe 3, actors that actually felt like they were AT LEAST trying, and you can clearly see who they are if you watched the show.If you're someone that actually pays attention to the storyline, to details (big or small), easily ticked off by bad acting and character breaks, then this show isn't for you.",negative,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"Stumbling upon the 2023 South Korean series ""Zombieverse"" on Netflix and seeing it was a zombie-based series, of course I stopped dead in my browsing and opted to sit down and binge-watch the eight episodes. Sure, I had never even heard about the series prior to stumbling upon it by random luck.Well, I have to say that sitting through the eight episodes was somewhat of a mixed bag of nuts, because there were certainly good parts to the episodes, but there most certainly were also bad things.The storyline throughout the eight episodes was actually fair enough, and it was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Just don't expect the writers to revolutionize the zombie genre, and you're good to go. I will say that the storyline was actually the driving force that kept me glued to the screen throughout the entire first season.Something I didn't enjoy one bit about ""Zombiverse"" was the way that the series was presented like a computer game in certain ways, especially with the cursors beneath people and the observation symbols over the heads of the zombies. It just added a very ridiculous layer to the movie, and it didn't appeal to my liking.Then there was the acting performances, which was most certainly a very mixed bag of nuts, because some of the actors and actresses were fully and wholly unable to act properly or believable, while other actors and actresses were essentially carrying the entire show, having to drag along the dead-weight performers. The way that some of the actors and actresses kept on grinning just didn't work for me. If you were caught in a zombie outbreak with your very life at risk, you wouldn't tackle the situations with a stupid grin.And also the fast-running and super agile zombies were not something I was a fan of. Never have, never will be. And ""Zombiverse"" had a lot of those, and even had a hyper-fast zombie as well.If they are releasing a second season of ""Zombiverse"", don't expect to see me at the front row, waiting in line to secure my ticket and seating.All in all a mediocre attempt of a zombie series from South Korea. My rating of ""Zombiverse"" lands on a very bland five out of ten stars.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

-Absolutely horrible acting with annoying fake crying by some of the cast.-Being loud all the time when its supposed to be a zombie apocalypse takes away any small amount of immersion you might be lucky to find.The Good:

tt26770113,"The show presents a unique take on the familiar zombie theme, distinguishing itself from other similar shows through several features. One of the most notable aspects is the casual tone that pervades the series. This relaxed atmosphere is accentuated by clever humour, using witty jokes and humorous situations to provide comic relief and lighten the mood.However, there are areas where the show could improve. Pacing is one such issue. Specific episodes feel drawn out, leading to potential disengagement from the audience. Examining its narrative structure could help identify and adjust any uneven sections for improved pacing. Another area of concern is the use of clich√©d elements. Some parts of the show can seem clich√©d or overused, which reduces its distinctiveness.In conclusion, the show, while offering a fresh perspective on the zombie genre through its casual tone and humour, has areas that could benefit from refinement. By addressing these concerns, it could elevate its appeal to the audience.",neutral,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

tt26770113,"Oh man, what a brilliant idea!Firstly, let's make something clear: ""Zombieverse"" is very, very, very different from any other zombie media you've likely seen. It's meant to be a ""reality"" show, meaning the content is unscripted. Just like how improv comedy shows have a much different feel to them than scripted comedy standup shows, the same rings true here.The biggest issue most people will encounter is the lack of emersion for the viewer. They did what they could to help with this -- e.g., it appears they intentionally avoided closeups and instead stuck to primarily wide-angle views. When interesting things happen, it seems like they do some clever editing to make it feel more real to the viewer. At times, it's possible they even recreated events that took place if they didn't play out well on camera.Still, while the actors are in character, they do let reality bleed through. This is, however, intentional. Without this, the idea wouldn't work.In essence, what I mean by that is that you can tell something about the acting is ""off"", in addition to the unscripted nature of the show. For one, if you see a zombie in real life and decide to hit it over the head with something to kill it, you're not going to hold back. They know the zombies are all also actors, so they are very limited in the actions they can take. This is why there is a lot of grabbing, pushing, and pulling and less actual violence. The lack of lethal actions against the zombies creates a subconscious breaking of emersion for the viewer.Overall, however, the show does what it's supposed to. Rather than watching a fantasy/horror TV show about zombies, the show becomes far more entertaining when you instead view it more as a game show. To win, they not only have to beat the game (not turn into a zombie), but also stay in character. Breaking character would inevitably result in a loss for the contestant. With this perspective, it's honestly brilliant and incredibly entertaining.In addition, many of the reactions are genuine, especially when it comes to jump scares. While there isn't any real ""fear"" in the sense of ""I'm afraid of being eaten by a zombie"", jump scares are still just as scary as a friend hiding behind a door to jump out and scare you. There's no danger, but the reaction is still fully real.The humor is also incredible as the contestants let reality ""leak through"", as I mentioned before. This makes it clear that they aren't trying to ""trick"" the viewer into feeling like they're encountering real zombies, which would be a bit of an insult to the viewer. That's not the goal, however, hence the unrealistic humorous moments are frequent and 100% natural. Given that many contestants are known comedians, this was very clearly intentional, and a brilliant idea.Also, I feel like a lot of non-native reviewers are basing their reviews on the English dub. I haven't watched Zombieverse with subs and original audio, but in almost all cases (especially with live action), they have to balance lip syncing with logical and fluid sentences. They tend to prioritize good lip syncing, meaning sometimes sentence structures can feel unnatural. This is a side-effect of dubbing that will exist until AI is used to automatically change the lip movements of the characters (not generate the actual voice acting, however; we want to keep that industry human for as long as we can).In any case, don't let the low score fool you: for what the show is trying to do, it is incredibly well done.",positive,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"
tt26770113,"The first few episodes were not that great, but the second half had me in stitches.The premise of the show isn't that good, but there are laughs aplenty.When the people break character and start laughing, it's infectious.

His scenes with the undercover reporter is hilarious and a highlight.I'm almost certain thatJonathan breaks character the most. .Park Na-rae is sassy and her teaming up with fellow half zombie Hong Seong-woo was a perfect match.So, if you stopped watching after the first few episodes (like I did).

tt26770113,"It can't be easy to come up with any new ideas in the Zombie genre these days as it has been done to death (pun intended) for decades now.Zombieverse is a new take that I haven't seen before.I imagine it's probably a lot more scripted than it looks (and could well be just 100% scripted) but it comes across as a tongue-in-cheek, semi-reality, drama, comedy, skit-show, horror. Yes, it's quite difficult to define.They got a group of famous Sth Korean celebrities, most of which are comfortable in front of the camera and some obviously aren't which clever editing has hidden as much as possible, and dumped them into this psuedo-realistic zombie gameshow where from their natural reactions we are supposed to believe that they aren't ""acting"" but are actually experiencing a zombie apocalypse.Think Schwarzenegger's The Running Man mixed with Celebrity Survivor but with a strong comedic bent and with all the bloopers left in and you might get sort of a feel what this series is like.It sounds like a train wreck I know but they actually make most of it work. Not all as some parts fall flat but most.I'm sure there is quite a bit of improv which mostly works and is very funny when it does.I noticed a lot of reviewers stopped watching early and gave it scathing reviews. This is kind of understandable as you have to be in the right mood and watch a few episodes to get in the right mindset but it's worth it in the end.I could write a lot more about the complexities of the show but this is enough already.

The show was already a bit sexist in the way men treated women as kind of incapable little things - thank God subleader was a badass - but Patricia just perpetuated this image unfortunately.

They are supposed to filming another reality show, and then a zombie outbreak happens, and they are stuck in it. They move from place to place trying to solve challenges, figure out what the zombies respond to, get certain items, escape and not be bitten. The sets are really well done and SUPER fun--they are actually driving cars, going from place to place, etc. (though in reality more likely set to set), and it actually looks so fun to be in this immersive environment.The actors are playing themselves, but committing for the most part to the ""zombie outbreak"" environment, but they do break character from time to time laughing at the silliness, making jokes, etc. But they do get into solving the problems and puzzles, and figure out the next step. And what happens if someone does get bitten? You'll have to watch to find out. It's honestly so fun, though it IS silly as hell.

Once a cast member has been ""bitten"" they are given a wound and a timeline as to how long they have until they become full zombies. Ultimately you want to avoid getting bitten but they're all aware it's a possibility. I myself think this is AMAZING! It's such a creative take on reality tv. Live action role play meets games how.

Dex and Jin Young with their potato gun was funny too and don't get me started on the DinDin scene with Yoo Hee-kwan.

It's unscripted in the sense that the contestants don't know what each stage will consist of and they are all doing their best to not get infected and lose the game. I think the 1 star reviews are unwarranted and it's a shame that they dragged down the rating when it was really enjoyable to watch.",positive,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

So whoever doesn't like this show hold this L because you have no imagination whatsoever. The amount of effort that went into this show was extremely impressive! You will never beat a reality show like this. And this show is literally so hilarious! I also loved how they did the zombies makeup. Looks so real! And I was laughing my butt off the whole show because it's so funny and unhinged. Again if you don't like this show we don't care go back to watching the boring bachelor or whatever. Hopefully they make a s2 of zombieverse! Great job to the whole cast and crew!",positive,"Comedy, Game-Show, Horror"

In every series the characters always holds weapons but in this series they fought barehand maximum times! All I like is their chemistry, it was really funny alot !

tt31038436,"Top 5 the worst netflix or even korean variety show i've ever watched, the writer and producer messed up with this one. I cant believe netflix korea produced such a confusing, jumbled, and boring show. The storyline is all over the place, all that big anniversary / event / show / birthday party packed into 2-4 mins soulless scene with no intention, its like watching a bunch of videos put together randomly.I give it 5 stars because its still fun watching David, Teo, and Se-Ho as the main host. David and Se-Ho should meet each other!It would be interesting if the host can join the cast living their daily life, not just reacting from a single room for 6 episodes straight hahaha.",neutral,Reality-TV
tt31038436,"It appears that to some people, viewing the idiosyncracies of the super rich is somehow entertaining. It is hard to fathom how anyone thinks this, especially with excuciatingly vapid and superficial shows like this.They are bad enough in the west. But when you factor in the inanity, peurility, and vacousness you get when the three presenters appear to want to intend it for an audience of three year olds, it reaches a new low.The fact is, 'rich' people (most of whom have become wealthy because of some annoying quirk of fate anyway) seldom have anything interesting in their lives. The only thing they offer is their narcissism and self absorption.If that's your thing, knock yourself out.This show is the intellectual equivalent of staring at paint drying.",negative,Reality-TV

No hobbies no...I don't even know.Double blind dates, anniversary parties, birthday parties, house tours, and house and clothing shopping.

tt31038436,"This is the worst & most shallow Korean reality show I've watched and I can't finish it. There's nothing worth watching. I was just curious to see what it was but all I saw were very materialistic people who are obsessed with self indulgence. These people have to learn the difference between freedom and self indulgence. Saying that dresses are more important than your own life? You should get yourself a doctor. You can afford psychiatric help anyway. Although Im not sure there's a cure to the highest level of materialism and self indulgence. There is nothing wrong with being super rich but how you use that wealth says everything about your moral and values. The only person there who is worth watching is Noor Naim. Her story is inspiring because she went from nothing to having everything she ever wanted. That is a true story of success. The rest were born with a silver spoon, which of course isnt wrong and just a good stroke of fate but helloooo...one thinks clothes are more important than life, one is acting like a good friend and is nice to everyone but actually has a sleek personality and knows what he is doing. He wants to steal the limelight from his friend because he knows he looks better than him and he wants more air time. I think he is the worst friend to have. One that acts all nice and perfect but actually just doesnt want anyone to take his shine. I swear I was so annoyed at his friend at first because he was overconfident about his looks and his outfits are too flashy but after that blind date where his friend had to come along even if he shouldnt have, I felt so bad for him. If anything, he might be the most annoying super rich person at first, but as you continue to watch him he is the most genuine of all the characters in that show aside from Noor. Because he knows what he wants, he dresses how he wants and doesnt take other people's opinion just to be nice. The hosts shouldnt be there. All three of you deserve a show that has more depth and meaning.",negative,Reality-TV

If there was a way to mute their nonsense noise making then maybe i would have watched this a bit longer.

tt14482414,"This is a charming coming of age tale against the backdrop of country life and high school sports.üè∏B is a great show for families to watch together, as long as the subtitles aren't an obstacle. Qualities that the show reinforces include: Loyalty, standing up for what's right, defending the weak, hard work, compassion, respect, and teamwork.It follows badminton teams from schools in rural Korea. There's not alot to do in a town that doesn't have sufficient population to support many forms of entertainment. It's even difficult to get wifi. Sports and friendships are what the kids work on most. We follow them through regular match-ups, individual and team competitions, and various family dynamics, as they gradually become a cohesive unit. The show, additionally, addresses the problem of vicious hazing and other abuses that can arise in a group of uber competitive Type-A personalities.Positive cross-generational relationships are displayed in RB. The elderly couple that lives down the road loves to host the kids. They share a meal and, more significantly, their wifi. In return, the kids help them with reading and operating their cell phones. It's darling.YIKES! A Fight‚ùï We see another side of the coin in a town hall where a village elder and one of the young players tackle eachother over conflicting ideas over how to generate more business in town. The problem, apparently, is that they have matching personalitiesüòâ. Neither one of them has good ideas anywayüòÜ. It's a funny scene.The kids help plan a birthday party for the oldest grandma in town. The whole thing is precious. As grandma is from Busan, can you guess what movie they played? Yep, the Zombie thriller: üöÑ To Busan. All Young-tae saw was that the title contained the word ""Busan."" Some of the party-goers didn't open their eyes for 2 hours, lol.It's impossible to review this show without addressing the controversy that has arisen around it. In ep5, an athlete was met with some boos while playing in üáÆüá©Indonesia. There were some that saw this as an insult to their country. In The West we generally don't understand much about Asian culture. It does appear that they are sincere about their complaint as it is a matter of their honor, and we should accept that. However, being offensive was obviously not the intent of Netflix & the show creators.Instead of giving feedback, a world wide vocal group took to their keyboards and attacked the show and Netflix as if insult was intended. It spread over social media and the ever-outraged went out of their way to give the show a low rating. Most Kdramas have under 3000 viewers on IMDB registering their ratings of a given show. Contrast that with üè∏B, which had a whopping 24k ratings of ""1"" weeks before all the episodes were out‚ùó I actually watched üè∏B to find out how bad it was. I'd never seen such a low rating on IMDB.I wonder if most of the people on the üöÑ-to-umbrage actually saw this show before they rapaciously rambled down the tracks? Anyone posting a review having never watched the show is neither genuine nor trustworthy. The show creators are much tougher on their ownüá∞üá∑country than anywhere else. I initially breezed by ep5 and never noticed anything offensive. (To be fair, I'm originally from right outside of Philadelphia, where the fans are notorious for being ill-behaved. I'll grant that my bar must be a little skewed downward by that;)There's no perfect country. Perhaps everyone should unclutch their pearls, remove the shuttlecock from their eyes, and take a wider-angle view of the issues hereüëÄ: What happens in ep5 is trivial compared to what actually goes on in sports.Fans in üá¨üáßWembleyüèü have booed during other team's national anthems.It's shocking to hear that fans in üá™üá¶Spain have done monkey chants and thrown bananas at African playersüò±.Sadly, fans in üá∫üá≤Philadelphia really did boo üéÖ and throw snowballs at him.Suspicions were raised against the New England Patriots that they had listening devices planted in the away locker rooms. Peyton Manning would not discuss anything sensitive in the locker room at Gilletteüèü. Tony Dungee would not allow his players to have possession of their playbooks as anything left in their Boston hotel rooms was liable to end up with Belichick's staff prior to the game. There's other stories of away locker rooms with poor lighting, bad smells, no heat or the thermostat not working right, no hot water, etc etc. Are the outraged here even sports fans? If so, they would know that some fans can be rabid maniacs. Right or wrong, sports is a venue that fans utilize to vent their frustrations.I've even seen reviewers sneering at badminton: They write that it is a poor concept for a show. Badminton happens to be quite popular in all of Asia. The competition is intense, with the shuttlecocks, or birdies, typically flying off the racket at speeds up to 250 mph. Speeds have been recorded as high as 267 mph. This makes it the fastest sport in the üåé That Shuttlecock would win its share of pro drag races at those speeds.Most of the actors in this show are KIDS. They all delivered first rate performances. People are heartless to trash the WHOLE show into which these kids clearly put their whole hearts. Their efforts deserve praise. Kang Hoon-kim (Yong-tae) is particularly special. He is a scene stealer; a top-shelf talent. Tang Joon-sang, who plays Hae-kang, is also quite talented. He plays a boy with Aspergers in Move To Heaven, and the sweetest North Korean soldier ever, in Crash Landing On You {Don't miss that one, btw}. The parts are characters that are completely unique from each other, and he's convincing in these roles. Ahn Se-bin plays the coach's youngest daughter, age 5 or so. She steals every scene she's in, and she also teaches the elderly couple how to read. It's cuteness overload.Finally, the whole show is cuteness overload. It couldn't be more adorable, and these kids could not be more precious. So give it a fair go and cheer these kids on; even if you are a Pats fan :) üòâ ;)",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Sport"

But after the lead character overcomes his dilemma regarding which sport he'd prefer to play, the show loses its edge.Once two of the players join the national team, the remaining team members are sidelined and relegated to messing around with the village elders and their silly antics.Training? What's that??? Their coach certainly doesn't know. Discipline? The kids are certainly not going to learn that from the coach.The show does however vaguely allude to issues in sports cutlure- how female athletes have a different set of problems to face than their male counterparts, how sports media tries to get inside athletes' heads and can try to psych them out, how people may try gain favor with judges using small tokens or gifts or connections, the issue of abuse that is prevalent in most sports and even more so in the hierarchy at colleges, also how nationalism can cloud how people play against those of foreign countries, but also how athletes are usually friends in spite of being rivals.These themes might not have been handled well enough, but I applaud the attempt.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Sport"

A surprising amount of decent badminton showing dedication, commitment, technical progress, challenges met and conquered. A glimpse of the pressure the kids and their coaches are under, as well as the situation in a typical agricultural township which is gradually experiencing depopulation and all of its inconveniences. Some confusing parts,
such as suggesting a third of the way through that Hae Kang Yoon and Se Yoon were in elementary school together when in fact he was from Seoul and she from Daegu. Though its a highschool team we never meet any other students, aside of the 25 baseball players, there is nobody that isn't a badminton player. There seem to be only 7 adults in the whole town yet they initially truly believe they've been outvoted about the development proposal even though it's being proposed by a man they have little regard for to a room full of these same 7 people, none of whom wanting to accept the terms.But if you collect the names of Korean dishes you will be well served as food is hugely important and symbolic in this show, if that's your thing it'll peak your curiosity.With one more episode I am amazed at the speed in which I devoured the whole series.

tt14482414,"Loved this. A story about playing badminton. Have respect for badminton players because we tried it at school, and I had neither the grace nor temperament for it.Characters are all well depicted. Cussing involved is not a whole lot compared to the unintelligent use of the fword in grade A or grade B pictures. But comes from mouths of kids. Why I'm not surprised or offended? As one who entered teaching service in 2005, less than 20 cusswords minus the fword is nothing compared to what I heard in my first hour on a compound. Rough baptism indeed.Depiction of characters is top-class and comedic intent in some scenes undeniable. But plot and subplot raise social issues and delivery of latter provoked deep respect for creators for doing so. So, while not as interesting as main plot, it is top of the class among subplots because it has worth and specific to local audience. Many may disapprove because it doesn't take them far from reality and cussing raises an uncomfortable truth- it jolts you back to earth.But if you let go of your offense at cussing or annoyance at a few of the characters in the subplot, you find hilarity that is both good for the bones but bad for under garments. So, thanks for keeping art with a social conscience alive. Today's viewing is often about escapism via mindless entertainment and not necessarily an act of curiosity. Too often we demand more from television and other entertainment services than we have the courage to demand from politicians and too much market trends bear witness to the awful truth: in this modern world too many are not as smart as their phones yet pride themselves on being smarter than their ancestors.If you need to laugh, watch this. If you desire to learn of the fate of other sports or care to learn about, or from, a different culture or people, watch this. If you want to see good talent in an under-rated drama, watch this. If you can stand not to be part of fashion trends on social media, watch this.If not, be happy with allowing your phone or social media to direct your train of thought.

His smug face annoys the hell out of me and now he's having romantic angle which feels out of place and is laughable to watch. I've seen the actor in CLOY and Move To Heaven before this and I know he's a talented young man but this character doesn't sit right with me.

The actual sports scenes were average at best, it's themed around the sport but not the sport itself. Most scenes with a sweaty face, the sweat looked as fake as it can be. It's so damn laughable that some scenes the neck was sweaty but the face was perfectly dry! The cast didn't do a good job in showing the physical exhaustion of performing the sport whether it was while training or competing. Again, making the sports scenes even more fake. What's up with the drama trying so hard to pair every boy with a girl? Really unnecessary. This drama would have fared infinitely better as a standalone one-off movie.

Tang Junsang is a phenomenal actor and his credibility just keeps shooting up for me with each of his dramas that I watch! It's great seeing such young, fresh, talented people as rising talents nowadays. In the drama, it was really, really nice seeing this group of male friends be unabashedly affectionate with each other, without any indication of toxic-masculinity-fueled discomfort. I wholeheartedly enjoyed all the BTS references throughout the drama, as well as the Prison Playbook cameos (it was especially lovely to see Kim Sungcheol in Episode 6--he is such a versatile and expressive actor). The soundtrack was also utilized very effectively.I understand the controversy about the few sentences of dialogue in Episode 5 (which the production team has apologized for), and am not saying that it was okay (I am South Korean myself and am aware of the prevalent sense of competition Korea has towards other countries, especially with sports), but I am rating the drama as a whole, and think that it would be unfair to mark it down like many other reviewers have. The part is very brief and I had to go back and find it. I am not Indonesian and therefore will not try to speak for the Indonesian community, so please be aware about these few lines of dialogue, and how they can come across as hurtful.Minus this one scene, this was a very good drama, and is 100% worth the watch.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Sport"

tt14482414,"Not many will like the show for its portrayal of badminton or the way players are trained but, i dont know how badminton is played or how unrealistic the show is, what i really liked about the show is how simple and real this show is about the struggle of youth, so far i have watched 10 episodes and i have come to the conclusion that more than badminton this show is about slice of life, for instance, Yoon Hae Kang cannot play baseball because his father couldnt pay the fee on time, parents who temselves have gone through rough time in their youth and dont want their kids to go throught the same, Jung In Sol father wants his son to follow in his footsteps, na un-chan family doesnt support him, these are some of the many realities that make this show worth the watch and dont forget the villager's who try their best to help each other, please dont judge the show based on how unrealistic the badminton is portrayed just think of this show as a slice of life and you wold be surprise to know how good the show is, i have loved all the episodes so far, give it a chance and you will love it too.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Sport"

I Love how the drama shows the positive of humanity and how good people can really be especially during difficult times, the friendship between the boys and the caring community within the village is truly admirable.

I recommend it to watch with your families and friends.I'm just disappointed on how others rate this show. That is so unfair. Stop being too sensitive people. It just shows that it might really happen in real life when it comes to sports. Rating this drama low can reflect and prove that those people are really like that in real life.

This is a best series with excellent script, actors with good acting. There are scenes make me think a lot. The plot is built with depth, I can see myself through the character, which leads to a good connection with the character. I would be happy if there is a season 2, the story of Hae Kang and his friends in the high school environment. In short, this is a drama that everyone is worth watching.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Sport"

They want to say that Indonesian is amazing but Seyoon's hard work and efforts paid off.The series also clearly shows how Seyoon an international badminton athlete.

The series always resurfaces the idea of teamwork, sportsmanship, fair play, family, and friendship. Also, the whole series does not reflect racism in all episodes and SBS already apologized for those instances. I am sorry too for the countries involved. There may be setbacks but the drama still remains its viewership and integrity in its theme throughout the episodes.The drama is so heartwarming, moving, and healing at the same time. They really progressed in making every character a story. We can see that when every character has their own story even for the village people. These things can happen in real life that is why this can be referred as a slice of life dramaI cannot express every great things about this drama but overall, this drama is highly recommended for family viewing. Teenagers, especially athletes can relate to the characters since this series highly depicts the real life of an athlete. Of course, families can also learn valuable lessons not just about sports but also in real life. In addition, the actors are great in acting.
