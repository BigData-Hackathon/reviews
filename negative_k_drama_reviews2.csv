tt16549178,"All participants in this drama, both actors and directors, understood that in making such a decision, there is a huge risk of injury and death of the animal. Apologies are easy to say, it is impossible to restore life to a living being. Drama cancellation and litigation is the perfect solution for all of them. Cruel, but deserved.For such a company, using computer graphics is not a problem at all, but it is clear that someone is especially greedy and continues to exploit animals for their stupid purposes. The question is, how many such projects were there before this drama and how many animals were harmed on their set for the sake of a few ""spectacular"" minutes? An animal died, footage of animal abuse was included in the episode, and the film crew just apologized .. do you think this is normal??",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"I don't think this show deserves to see the light of day. It wasn't worth the animal abuse that they condoned for a short shot in the show. Not only did they tie a real horse up and force it to land on its head, but the horse unfortunately died shortly after. If you're considering watching this show... don't. No show is worth the torture and death of an animal, especially not this one. There are many dramas that follow this unoriginal plot like this one that don't partake in cruelty like this.I hope this show gets cancelled, and they people behind this suffer the consequences.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,Don't support animal abuse in films or any other form of entertainment. The poor horse involved in this film endured horrific treatment which led to the unnecessary death of this innocent animal. They actually wired the horses legs together to make it fall and killed it. This is just beyond belief. Why was this allowed to happen? This is not entertainment.,negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"Watch behind the scenes. See how few of the set guys hold the rope and kill the horse in the set. Imagine, you have one job, its easy, to help the production, and you have brain as well. You know that what you are doing will kill the horse, and you are killing a horse with your own hands. I wonder the psychology of the authority who decided this. No movie set should have the courage to kill an animal.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"The tv series itself is great. It's like a Korean Game of Thrones - many characters and parties fighting for the throne, each has bad side and good side. Complex characters, great writing and storyline. It's like the dark truth of history, not a fairytale-like story like many other historical kdramas. This is definitely the best Korean tv show I have seen!All the complaints and bad ratings are because of the animal abuse scandal. One horse died during filming, sadly. While this is very unfortunate and I hope the responsible ones were fired and the necessary actions were taken to avoid such abuse in the future, I don't think it has anything to do with the quality of the series itself. There were probably a few production workers who work with the horses, they made this terrible mistake. But there are hundreds of others, innocent people, who work on this production! The great actors, the script writers, the costume designers, the set designers, the cameramen, etc! Don't degrade their work too just because a few others made that terrible mistake! It's as if you canceled the great movie The Pianist because of the director Polanski's scandals. You can't cancel or degrade a whole production, which is the great work of hunderds of good people, because of the scandal of a few people.",positive,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"In the 21 century,to not use the computer graphic,and still kill an innocent animal...I can't believe. That was the last straw. I'm looking for watching Cdrsma from now on. I can't believe in a high developed country as South Korea ...üò≥üëéüèªüëéüèª",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"The series was great. Every episode of the series was wonderful and exciting and the actor of the main character ""Joo Sang Wook"" was great in it. His acting was very cool and impressive and I liked him very much. His facial expression and acting in different scenes made me think that he is a versatile actor. He's a really talented actor. Definitely, he's been in the industry for so long, but he's still able to deliver amazing performances.And about the story of the series, because it was completely based on Korean history and historical facts, it was very attractive and exciting to me.It was such a touching series
Thanks to all the creators of this series.",positive,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"All actors and crew know animals are killed to make this show. Just look at the poor video of them killing a horse for just one scene. Purposefully tripping it. It died a week later, but looks extremely injured so therefore it must have suffered for a long while. This show needs to be banned and and all participants jailed or fined. Disgusting.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,The show overall is tasteless. It's not only tasteless but they killed a horse while filming. Absolutely terrible. Whoever came up with the idea to tie the horse should get fired and should go to jail for animal cruelty. Disgusting.,negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"It might have a decent story line but I will never know because I will never watch something that chose violence, abuse and neglegence of an animals welfare for a mere scene. I am an avid fan of Korean production but this is just far too much...",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"I totally agree with rkpmthk's observation. I really wanted to see this and I started watching it at a Korean friend's place - couldn't continue. Animal cruelty is the most abhorrent thing to me and this just turned my stomach; then again, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,"Hi Angelique, and whoever supports this show and the ones behind it, if you consider killing a horse on PURPOSE is a mistake, then you're no less as sick and disgusting as the perpetrators who commited this vile and awful act.Kami had his legs tied up with wire, several people pulled on those wires as soon as he started running with the sole purpose of tripping him, Kami ended up falling (as they wanted) and breaking his neck, nobody there cared about him as he lay there in what I would imagine was excruciating pain, he died a week later due to his injuries, they killed him for entertainment, he was only around 5 years old, he still had 20-25 years ahead of him, but they killed him on purpose for what? A couple minutes in a TV show?Btw this was not the first time KBS had done this, this is just the one that they were caught red handed in doing, so no, this was not an accident, a MURDER was commited, and your cold heartedness in supporting the murderers really shows what kind of evil you are.",negative,"Drama, History"
tt16549178,The prior review by angelique says everything I think about this complex intelligent work of genius. I have seen probably 40 Kdramas of which most have been excellent. With gorgeous boys (thank you!) and gals. And clever tricks.This isn't that. It's deeply serious with no easy answers about who is good or bad. It's a very complicated story that will demand your attention. Don't miss it.,positive,"Drama, History"
tt31038436,"Top 5 the worst netflix or even korean variety show i've ever watched, the writer and producer messed up with this one. I cant believe netflix korea produced such a confusing, jumbled, and boring show. The storyline is all over the place, all that big anniversary / event / show / birthday party packed into 2-4 mins soulless scene with no intention, its like watching a bunch of videos put together randomly.I give it 5 stars because its still fun watching David, Teo, and Se-Ho as the main host. David and Se-Ho should meet each other!It would be interesting if the host can join the cast living their daily life, not just reacting from a single room for 6 episodes straight hahaha.",neutral,Reality-TV
tt31038436,"It appears that to some people, viewing the idiosyncracies of the super rich is somehow entertaining. It is hard to fathom how anyone thinks this, especially with excuciatingly vapid and superficial shows like this.They are bad enough in the west. But when you factor in the inanity, peurility, and vacousness you get when the three presenters appear to want to intend it for an audience of three year olds, it reaches a new low.The fact is, 'rich' people (most of whom have become wealthy because of some annoying quirk of fate anyway) seldom have anything interesting in their lives. The only thing they offer is their narcissism and self absorption.If that's your thing, knock yourself out.This show is the intellectual equivalent of staring at paint drying.",negative,Reality-TV
tt31038436,"There's literally nothing going on here. All that you'll be watching is five rich people try to be interesting and three hosts try to make the rich people interesting. There's no direction in this series, the entire season could be summarised in a single 30 minute episode.They are beautiful and they have money but that's about it. No hobbies no...I don't even know.Double blind dates, anniversary parties, birthday parties, house tours, and house and clothing shopping. So so many things happening and yet nothing at the same time.Theo and the David carried this show as much as they could, I'll give them their credit because without them it would've been...yea.",negative,Reality-TV
tt31038436,"This is the worst & most shallow Korean reality show I've watched and I can't finish it. There's nothing worth watching. I was just curious to see what it was but all I saw were very materialistic people who are obsessed with self indulgence. These people have to learn the difference between freedom and self indulgence. Saying that dresses are more important than your own life? You should get yourself a doctor. You can afford psychiatric help anyway. Although Im not sure there's a cure to the highest level of materialism and self indulgence. There is nothing wrong with being super rich but how you use that wealth says everything about your moral and values. The only person there who is worth watching is Noor Naim. Her story is inspiring because she went from nothing to having everything she ever wanted. That is a true story of success. The rest were born with a silver spoon, which of course isnt wrong and just a good stroke of fate but helloooo...one thinks clothes are more important than life, one is acting like a good friend and is nice to everyone but actually has a sleek personality and knows what he is doing. He wants to steal the limelight from his friend because he knows he looks better than him and he wants more air time. I think he is the worst friend to have. One that acts all nice and perfect but actually just doesnt want anyone to take his shine. I swear I was so annoyed at his friend at first because he was overconfident about his looks and his outfits are too flashy but after that blind date where his friend had to come along even if he shouldnt have, I felt so bad for him. If anything, he might be the most annoying super rich person at first, but as you continue to watch him he is the most genuine of all the characters in that show aside from Noor. Because he knows what he wants, he dresses how he wants and doesnt take other people's opinion just to be nice. The hosts shouldnt be there. All three of you deserve a show that has more depth and meaning.",negative,Reality-TV
tt31038436,"What is the point in having three people comment on every 4th-6th scene? All they do is point out the obvious and say wow every single time? Completely annoying and no point... this should be called a reaction video of the super rich in korea. I had to stop watching after 4 minutes into it. If there was a way to mute their nonsense noise making then maybe i would have watched this a bit longer. All they do repeat the scene, ""look at the bag"", ""look at the room"", ""wow"", ""wow"", ""wow"", ""they are going into the room"", ""wow"", ""what?"", ""wow"", ""wow"", ""wow"", ""wow"", ""wow"". You can understand the amount of ""wow"" and the entire 4 minutes into, i am trying to understand why they are even there.. do they need to be there to help explain how rich these people are? Are they trying to invoke me agree with their ""wows""?",negative,Reality-TV
tt31038436,"No direction , not happening quite boring and can be shorten much much more. Their life looks boring to me also nothing big or surprising happening there , the crazy rich asians video from youtube had more dept and stuff going on . The series had no specific direction. Also the crazy rich people dont have strong personality . I know they are rich etc but do they bring dept and character to the drama? They did nothing except fashion and buying stuff its boring. Also most of them doesnt look attractive nough to carry a series , its quite anooying to keep watching them , overall its not super bad but it sould be better.",negative,Reality-TV
