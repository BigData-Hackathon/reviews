"I saw Squid game. It felt good. But not as good as the whole world was saying. The two reasons for this popularity are the unique storyline and Korean involvement. Major flaws exist. Unnecessary showed bad quality sex scene. There was a forceful storyline. Could have shown more murders. English dubbing was very bad. But the Hindi dubbing was very good. Hindi dubbing was far better than perfect. The dual element of entertainment was suspense & production design.Marvel's Loki is much better than this. But if you see it, you will not understand anything. Because to watch it, you have to watch the entire Infinity Saga (total 23 movies) first.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha .",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable. Yes there will be a second, and yes I will watch it because the actors are superb. But it still is not in the class of finest KDramas.However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world. But just promote films; don't intrude on them-you don't have the moxie much less the gift.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series is so overrated. But let's be fair, it's a very good series. I've watched a few movies about it. The script was good. Acting was sometimes exaggerated, maybe it's a cultural thing. I did not like the final part. Overall very well done. In the final episode, my expectation was different. But the final scene was disappointing. Season 2 will come, I hope it doesn't fall into ""La Casa De Papel"" status.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly na챦vety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Please remove all traces of the VIPs and you can get the 2 stars back.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments clich챕, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is the proof people are still fans of predictable stories. If this is the 2021 most mainstream TV series, something is definitely off. Except for a few moments and interesting parts when they participate in the game, everything else is filled with already seen stuff. Main character's morality is selectable/clashing in different situations, ridiculous plot twists and most of all, acting and dialogue of ""rich people watching"" is major cringe. I would avoid this, except if you really want to see why is this so popular.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I m falling shortage of words. All i can say is it is 100/100 and a must watch for all thriller show lovers. All episodes are worth watching.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It was so intresting that i finished all in 1 day.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The basic idea behind the show isn't really out of the world about how you have to compete to death to gain something but the twisted fact that the show turns children's games to their ugliest and gorriest possible versions makes it a horrifying yet glued to Netflix kind of a watch. You're really missing out if you don't watch this one!,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.The fourth game was great tho, Ali's innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he's dead like for what?Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I am aware other countries have a fierce audience for ""game shows"" well this might wet their whistles, but it was hard for me to watch! I'm not a horror genre and this because of the amount of violence sits on that line and sometimes I leaned left while sometimes I leaned right. It was new creative good characters - just couldn't commit to 9 stars!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.More, more, more please.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show was amazing, apart from the thrill, drama and violence, it tried to show the social inequalities that people have to live with and they fight to survive! Yet another Korean masterpiece.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Decent set deco .Battle royal flavors.A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.Very bloody and gory at times.Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"As another review says, the VIPs acting is not bad. The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.As for the show, it is a great show. I strongly recommend watching it.Maybe not a 10/10 as that is reserved for films that changed my life, but definitely a 8/10.It is a great metaphor of capitalism and how our society forces people into extreme situations.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Korean Drama ""Squid Game"" is bloody, but, somehow, hopeful.It has a nice cinematography, with, sometimes, overused gore, but well executed action scenes. The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn't make sense, too much of it down to luck and it's very predictable. The characters' back stories are uninteresting, there's not much character development. It's average at best for the genre.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Very disturbing with grotesque violence. Poor acting, poor story. Why that hell were the 'supposedly good guys' feeling sorry for themselves when they voluntarily rejoined the games - the killings, deaths were inevitable but the main guy still wanted the moral high ground. Just a poor, very disturbing show, with all the grotesque violence and a poor ending. The main character only went back for the money, he knew in order to win others have to die. But now, he doesnt want to use the money and is annoyed at the killings - you cant have it both ways mate!!!. Please save your time and life and don't bother watching this show.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best kdramas ever. I will d챕fini rewatch t many times.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I just loved it! You can easy watch it during all weekend non stop! It's so much different from other series available. Completely different genre.Recommended to everyone.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I cannot praise this series enough. At first, I didn't like some of the over-reaction from many of the characters but this might just be my own cultural failings. But, I loved the way the characters developed and interacted, their differing views and what they each 'brought' to the series. I agree with the other reviewers that E6 is just superb - it is a masterpiece of story telling in a way that Hollywood tends to forget. The acting was so good. All in all, this series has totally entertained me and surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The concept is pretty good-how far would you go to win a life changing amount of money, especially when you have hit your lowest point? I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire ""VIP"" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"So.... the ENTIRE premise is based on 'let's play games that we played as kids, that were based on skill and that are completely fair, and we're ALL on equal ground'.... series keeps that premise from EP01 until EP05, where it becomes not only a rigged game, but also no longer based on skill, but COMPLETELY based on luck. This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series. I think they should make a Season2, and I just hope to God that in Season2, they don't completely derail the premise like they did in Season1, because Season1 is completely spoiled because of that.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Everybody has been talking about ""Squid Game."" I've been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn't feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don't watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched ""Squid Game"" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it's meh.To me it's a Korean ""Hunger Games."" I know that there are some big differences, but it's still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we're all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it's a victim of its own hype, but I wasn't that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn't want to be in, but I will say that some of the 'umph' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I've labeled this spoiler so I'll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it's a dead giveaway that they're going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to ""Squid Game"" I say ""Meh."" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn't interest me enough. If ""Squid Game"" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would've been a lot better. That being said, I'm committed now. I would like to see what happens in season two.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly. The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Creator and director Dong-hyuk Hwang certainly had one crazy vision, and successfully made a series of it. Sure it has plot and technical issues, and I wasn't fond of the ending - I re-wrote it in my head much better, but for a somewhat newb Korean filmmaker, this was epic.The visuals, props and sets were outstanding. The cinematography and score amazing. The casting and performances by all, except the VIP's, was excellent. Props to Neflix once again, and thanks for dubbing this one right this time. Hoping for a S2 real soon. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I really don't know what all the fuss is about... The acting is strong (as expected from Korean actors and actresses) but most people are talking about the plot, which to me, is nothing special. Sure there are some plot twists but there are also way too many gaps for this to be called a ""classic"" or ""masterpiece"".",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The symbolism behind this show is representative of The Dangerous Game and Eyes Wide Shut. Satanic billionaires that run all our world institutions bored with all they have desperate to feel any kind of emotion, which apparently comes from dehumanizing the masses and defiling the innocent.Those that find enjoyment are already lost to degeneracy.

"I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"After all the hype this series caused I finally decided to watch it and honestly I enjoyed the beginning of it up until maybe the 6th episode. The games started to become boring and meaningless and the VIPs were the worst thing ever! Bad acting and awful dialogue, no one talks like that in real life, they had so much potential but it was wasted. The ending was disappointing, okay number 001 was the mastermind but that's it?! Really! And the main guy who won bothered me to no end, he was depressed and losing it over all the lives lost because of this game, blaming the rich for the game when in reality the poor enabled this too, the blame isn't solitary! And he refused to do anything or help anyone with the money for a whole year! He was a loser with no ambition before the squid game and chose to stay that way after it! He could've helped so many people, instead he sat in a corner feeling sorry for himself for a whole year, pathetic! Then when he pulls himself together (red hair and all) he backtracks at the last minute and decides oh I'm gonna undo all my character development and do the stupid impulsive thing instead! What a disappointment truly, again this had so much wasted potential, it could have been something truly mind blowing.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Not sure what all the hype was about. The most enjoyable thing about this show is watching all of the horribly unlikable characters get killed off.

"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan's Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the ""losers"" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers ""side-hustle"" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the ""real"" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed ""worthless"".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but ""manga"" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Extremely great and innovative. This film is frighteningly real and all of the performances of the actors are stellar and force you to not only be glued to the screen but to also carry the weight and feelings and emotions of the show with you for a little or sometimes long while after the episode has finished. Not sure if this was initially released weekly but I cannot even imagine the torture of that had I tried to watch it at the time it came out. It is very difficult to stop watching but also I was sometimes forced to because it became too emotional and invasive to me.

"The hype for this series is real. With incredible acting, and interesting dynamics and twists, I was on the edge of my seat almost all the time. The juxtaposition of children's games with horrifying themes was a great choice, and the overall design was top notch, especially the set design and costume design. Not only was it good looking it was memorable.Lee Jung-jae's performance was top notch, as was the majority of the performance from all main and supporting characters. The only exception here is the VIP's who were unbearably bad. I'm not sure if it was the dialogue or something, but they were just bad in general. There was also one particular plot point that was a little too obvious from the beginning, but no spoilers.It was all around one of the best shows I've seen.

"I feel like I can't really write a critical review because the TV show is that popular. Everyone is raging about it and it will end up making a billion dollars even though they for some reason only sold it for like $20m to Netflix. The first 5 episodes is great cinema. It's a great concept with people playing games with each other for a big money prize at the very end and the losers get killed. The 3 first games are fine enough, but only the first one is great. It does feel like it's always a promise of something bigger and better. Some big reveal that will make the TV show better and deliver on all the hidden factors. But in reality the more they reveal the worse the show gets. It's like revealing the monster in a movie to be some bad CGI creature. Episode 6 already contains a very weak nonsensical game. And the last 2 games are bad. So out of 6 games only 1 was good! That's pretty lame. The twist and turns also all lead to a worse TV show unfortunately. The first 2 episodes promise something big, but instead the show jumps the shark.A gang starts killing other competitors. But why? The more participants are left the higher is your own chance of survival as each participant is testing the games and finding out how to play them better so that everyone's chance of survival increases. So if the gang didn't kill anyone their chance of survival would skyrocket and they could just kill anyone they want before the last game.There is also a side-plot with a cop filming everything. This plot goes nowhere. He is just killed by his brother who runs the game place. But what the cop does makes no sense. For example, as he escapes they see him climb down a ladder. Before they got to him he had already put on a random diving suit and jumped into the water. So we are to believe this happened in maybe 2 minutes? We didn't even know if he could dive or not. It's also not clear why his brother runs the place. He just left his small cheap apartment suddenly and let his fish die to be this extremely powerful figure? The cop later throws his oxygen tanks on a beach while a boat searches for him. So of course they see the oxygen tank from afar and know he is there. These sort of things at the end of the show make no sense. He could have easily hidden on the island and then later found some fishing boat he could wave at.The main problem is of course the big reveal. It's all a violent show for billionaires so they watch people in debt kill each other for a prize. This idea has been explored a thousand times before in many B movies and it doesn't work here either. These Westerners are HORRIBLE actors. It's inexcusable. You can easily get a random person to act better than this. But I assume they were directed by someone who didn't speak English? The episodes they are in are obviously not fun to watch for anyone.And then there are the game rules. They make no sense and are not clearly explained. At times you see some huge twist in a game and a participant saying ""Well, you said the rules were such and such so that's how I won the game"". So after the fact we get some info about how this guy broke a game. This is a thing in all 6 games. The rules are vague and winners and losers just come about by some mystery. It's not terrible, just a bit weak as it makes little sense. In game 5 on the glass panels you even see the game maker shut off the light to make the game harder as they were near the very end. The game maker needed the last game to only have 2 survivors as only 1 winner is allowed. So while everyone thinks there is no limit and groups plan to win together in reality only one person can win yet no one knows this besides the game maker himself. This is also why the moderators let people kill each other and change the games as they are ongoing to kill a few more people. Also, the gang gets info about what game they are to play beforehand. Kinda a huge deal. These sort of changes and twists make it harder to really feel like these are real games. Rather it's just methods to kill people. The rules are never fair. At one point a game maker even takes part in a game and makes his own team win. Honestly, the reveals are horrible. The brother reveal makes no sense as we don't even know how the cop or brother is. And the old guy who also plays the games is a bad reveal too because it's just a random twist. It's not some info we were looking for.The ending makes no sense either. The winner doesn't spend any money even though he promised to help some specific people. Family members of friends killed in the game. And at the end he just walks somewhere. We never really understand what his plans are. If he or 500 other people wanted to they could have revealed the game. We even see him talk to cops. And many others surely also talked to cops. Even in the VIP areas were see a bunch of waiters and naked ladies just laying around. So all these random naked ladies know about all these murders too. Of course all the workers know about this too. If you want to have an ending with the winner trying to reveal the whole thing that makes absolutely no sense because he could have tracked this whole operation down in a week. They leave clues everywhere. If you put this info online people would find the location in a day. They would just search for underground buildings with huge automatic roofs that can open. Such projects would have thousands of workers and can be seen from space. This part of the TV show makes zero sense so having the lead decide to finally do something about it after a year makes no sense whatsoever. He could have revealed it all in a day. Anyone could. This and then the 2 big twist reveals are terrible. It's not really anything huge so you may just ignore it. But it illustrates how bad the writing actually is. It shows why the games are stupid and lazy too. It's not smart stuff.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life.

Koreans don't hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Poor dialogues, laughably loud melodramatic acting, predictable plot full of plot holes. Another overmarketed overhyped series by Netflix. The ending is laughably bad.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)
There were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I checked it out after all the hype and it exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this if you haven't seen it. The acting is good, storyline is good, scenery and special effects are good too!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I have to agree with others: I really didn't like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying. ""Gganbu"" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the ""one"" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show.They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame.The VIP's were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary. I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary.Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10. Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me. 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Despite all the cringey memes and Instagram/TikTok trends that made the momentum of this show tired, the show itself is absolutely brilliant. I watched this show twice in full already, both the Korean version and the English Dub version. Both were actually really well done. I normally don't like English dubs, but they actually did a very good job with the dub for this one (minus the red light green light song and a couple of the translations). All the characters are really enjoyable and played their parts so well. When you see them in talk in interviews, you can see they difference and how well they played their parts. They're all so likeable and I hope some of them can return for season 2 somehow. Even the 'villains' are a hilarious and the sweetest people in real life, so you know how well they acted. The makeup and costumes and sets were brilliant. When you watch the behind the scenes footage on how they filmed it and the emotion they actors put into it, it's just so fascinating.The story is both light-hearted and funny, but also very dark, deep and emotional. During and after each game, you feel the intense fear and grief that the characters are feeling and as the story progresses you feel that same uncomfortable feeling they do. The story has very deep undertones to the downfalls of how our society is and how the system takes advantage of our weaknesses and sets us up to fail.On top of the story, the story on how the show was created was really beautiful as well. How the creator wrote those show many years ago and no one would take it or fund it, how he lost teeth from all the stress, how he had no money. It's almost like he was one of the players in the game itself.I'm really looking forward to Season 2. I'm a bit worried though, because the creator didn't plan for a season 2 as he wasn't expecting it to be a global phenomenon, and he said he won't be writing season 2 on his own, it would be a team of people. So we'll see if they can keep the same deep quality and not ruin it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This TV show was very sad in the beginning but as it goes on it get good the story is very well written and I got to warn you its very graphic I give this show a thumbs up make that 4.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I don't know why the show gets so much praise internationally. I mean overall it's a really bingeable show, but there's really nothing much aside from that. In my country, the show receives so many polarized comments, with people either loving it badly or hating it with passion.The game master said that the game is created so that those mistreated in the outside world will be treated equally in the game, and yet the master himself did not get shot when he lost the game (voluntarily or not). In the ""walking on glass"" game, when one candidate knew how to tell tempered glass from normal glass, the front man turned off all the lights just to make the game more entertaining to the VIPs, effectively rendering the poor man unable to use his skills. I guess it's still much advantageous to be rich and powerful even in the so-called equal game, hah?The main character is horrible. He's a loser with no character development throughout the movie. He's described as a person that has so much compassion and empathy with others, yet in the end he didn't even bother visiting his daughter in the US - all because of some nonsense triggering comments from the front man. And gosh he wouldn't even have kept his promise to the North Korean defecting girl to take care of her brother had it not been for the call from the organizer. Such a f*cked-up man who I have no sympathy for.There are so many other flaws in the movie that I don't have time to bother mentioning. All in all, a movie with good intentions and palatable cinematography, but horrendous execution. If you like death-game shows, better watch Alice in Borderland, Jinrou Game, the Incite Mill, Liar Game, or many that actually make you use your brain to figure out how to escape your ill-fated situation and don't annoy you with hypocritical mouthings.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The biggest feat of this show was the amazing cinematography and the atmosphere it created. From the depressing streets of urban Seoul and poor living quarters to the colorful staircases and luxurious decors of the 'game quarters', every detail in every scene creates a certain mood and fits in perfectly.The acting was a little inconsistent, while many of the lead actors were fantastic, some of the actors that got less screentime were well below their level. But as I said they got less screentime, thus the impact stays very limited to the series as a whole.As for the plot and its subplots, it is nothing completely new or unseen but certain elements to it make it an unique experience anyway. Even when the outcome and some of the twists were predictable they were still enjoying to watch, just because of the execution. Nonetheless the show still manages to surprise the viewer from time to time.Overall I really enjoyed the experience despite its minor flaws, it still manages to be a extremely tense, beautiful and intriguing show. It is for that reason that I am very curious to see how (or if?) the writers will continue after the open ending of the first season.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I LOVED this show, you can binge-watch it, it's addictive.I don't like horror and blood, but this one was more of a thriller-suspense, even I liked it.It's a mix of: the chess scene from the first Harry Potter, Black Mirror and The platform.It's very hard to guess what's coming next, it keeps you interested and guessing.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"If you're on the fence, definitely give the show a try. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely in my ""all-time favorites"" now.It was a really good show until one of the episodes, which elevated the show to the next level and cemented its place on my all-time favorites list. I would have given the series a 10, but I was disappointed with the ending, which is why I lowered the score to a 9.Despite the ending, I consider it a must watch, or at the very least, a must try.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Very very minor spoiler. The show as a whole was phenomenal, and I'd recommend it to almost anyone, but the ending was weak. The second half of the last episode honestly weakened my rating by two full stars. Still worth it though.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I've watched this after the ""raging hype"", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all.The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place.Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series is beautifully produced and directed. So many stories with in itself and has drama, action, suspence. I couldn't stop watching it. I hope they do a second season, or add more episodes.Beware parents not for children, lots of death, gore, blood, simulated dead bodies, violence.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Humans vs humans is a no brainer for writers. Be it Hunger Games, 13, The Hunt, or Surviving the Game, I as well as others, for what ever reason, are going to watch...in spite of the quality.My first concern was the acting, not the actors ability, but them acting like Koreans. Are Koreans usually this giddy and overly reactive in certain situations? The main character at the horserace or with his daughter was uncomfortable to watch, but it could be it didnt translate well. As for the VIP, a lot of criticism has been on their acting, but does it matter since the Korean version would have translated there words for them? If so, they could have been spouting gibberish and the subtitles for the Korean audience would have remedied that easily.As with the aforementioned films, this one lacks a punch ending. Writers just dont seem to find a ending that is as strong as the beginning. The last game had none of the emotional power and cleverness of the prior ones. The 5th left something to be desired also, except to resolve an issue between two characters.I suffered through all of my criticisms, and you should as well. It is just such a strong idea, wish someone could deliver an ending.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I'm not really into films with dubbing but this was done well so you don't even notice. Probably up there with my favourite every series.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Pros:
1. There is great use of the colour palette, with greys, blacks, whites, browns and navy blues in the outside world used to portray a miserable, lifeless and oppressive world, whereas bright colours are used for Squid Game to ironically convey a place of death where they felt more alive and unburdened than they did in the outside world.2. The gore is brutal and gut-wrenching, but it's never over-the-top which helps the gore feel more real.3. The fight/ action scenes are raw and gritty, with the usage of close-up shots to heighten the claustrophobia and personal touch, thereby heightening the tension.4. The score does an incredible job at building up the atmosphere, in addition to being instantly recognisable.5. The deaths of Ali (Anupam Tripathi) Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) and Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) are deftly handled and are real tear-jerkers.6. The practical effects and set design are beautifully designed and they do an amazing job at building the Squid Game world.7. The show provides a really good psychological study on how humans react when their lives and fortunes are on the line, i.e. Self-preservation or cooperation; decisive or indecisive.8. Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is on the receiving end of a satisfying character ark from irresponsible, lazy and indecisive, to the complete opposite.9. There are phenomenal performances by Lee Jung-jae and Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo).Cons:
1. The flashbacks inserted to reiterate information the show has already told the audience, are redundant and patronising.2. It's baffling, and largely unbelievable, that the Squid Game operation has been going since 1999, yet only one cop in the recent year found multiple disappearances strange enough to investigate - and he was only investigating because of his brother.3. It was far too easy for Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-Joon) to infiltrate the secret island. You'd think that type of operation wouldn't make it as easy as they did to sneak onto the island.4. A lot of the information divulged during the show is done so via lazy exposition, the show doesn't seem to deem the audience intelligent enough to work things out for themselves.5. The criticism of the modern Neo-liberal, hyper-individualistic, capitalist system is rather on-the-nose, and it feels preachy and pretentious most of the time. There's a bizarre sub-theme of anti-Americanism and white supremacy that just feels forced.6. There is a ridiculous amount of screen-time wasted on a bizarre organ-harvesting sub-plot that doesn't go anywhere, and is clearly just placed so that the show can air the supposed virtue of equality and fairness, whilst Front man (Lee Byung-hun) who airs it, sanctions the killings of people who for whatever reason, found themselves in debt.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes ""Kamisama no iu t척ri."" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from ""actors"" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This is a simple formula that has been done to death ""poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch"". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like ""it's an study of human nature"" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga ""Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji"", which has been running from 1996. It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing ""Squid Game"".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this ""inspiration"".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. ""Squid Game"" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning"" (2018) or the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called ""The Vengeancers"".",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably don't need me to give you this warning. ""Squid Game"" is one of the most incredibly violent things you can watch and it's NOT something you want to let your kids see. And, if your mother or Father O'Reilly drop by, you also might want to think twice before watching this South Korean mini-series with them! You'll see hundreds dies, heads explode and tons of blood....just don't say I didn't warn you!In many ways, the show is a lot like the Japanese movie ""Battle Royale"" or the ""Hunger Games"" films...but with one huge exception. Unless the unwilling participants in the other films, the folks in ""Squid Game"" know what they're in for after the first round...and their deaths were because of their greed or situation in life.The film begins by showing you a bit of Seong Gi-hun's life. He (Lee Jung-jae) is a loser in pretty much every way and his gambling addiction has destroyed his marriage. He's deeply in debt to loan sharks who vow to kill him and you have a very hard time feeling sorry for the guy. He's ruined his, his wife's and his daughter's lives.When one of his loan sharks catches up to him, you assume they'll either beat Seong or kill him. Oddly, however, instead they have him sign a paper in blood....and in order to avoid being killed he signs it without hesitation. What he doesn't realize is that by doing this, he's agreed to enter one of the strangest gambling contests ever...if not the strangest.Seong arrives at the location the paper tells him to go to...but why, he isn't sure. Soon a van pulls up and he enters...and is knocked out almost immediately. When he awakens, he's with 455 other participants...who, at this point, have no idea what they're in for with these strangely clad 'hosts'. They are told they're playing a game of Red Light/Green Light...and most of the folks think it's all very childish. However, when the first one moves when it's a red light, snipers kill him!!! Soon, they realize that they'd BETTER make it to the goal line before the allotted time or they'll die...and die many of them do.After this 'game', about 200 of them were killed. But here's where it gets interesting. They are then allowed to vote as to whether to finish the game and go home or continue. By only one vote, they vote to go home. Episode two shows them at home...and it's my favorite one of the shows in the series. At this point, most of the remaining players actually decide to return to the game, as many of them face death or prison if they quit the game. The final seven episodes are the continuation of the game...as well as showing the actions of a cop who manages to infiltrate the contest.Again, just to make things clear, this is a mega-violent show....even more so than the ""Fargo"" television series! But I kept watching despite this because the writing was simply exquisite and the characters in the game truly memorable...and in some cases, infamous. It also is exceptional because so much of it is hard to predict! Overall, a film that is different enough from ""Hunger Games"" and ""Battle Royale"" that it really works well. I found it so compelling, I watched the entire series in one evening....though I'd only planned on seeing and episode or two.By the way, if you care, the amount won in the contest is a bit more than $38,000,000 US dollars.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The overall show was pretty cool but the ending is such a let down. The main character seems to hate himself so much that he cares nothing for his family or his life. Such a disappointment we could have ended it with him having a wonderful life with his daughter and starting season 2 brand new..... what were the writers thinking.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean language
I am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of this
They are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audience
and this is why it feels kinda off to those people
We are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversations

It's perfect in every sense and has every major ingredient that makes it one of the best shows of this decade hands down!The acting; absolutely incredible. The leads acting is stunning and beautiful even without him saying anything his facial expressions speaks volumes in VERY dramatic scenes (which scenes aren't?)The directing is stellar and flawless. I love shows that are truly unique; Severance, Night Sky just to make a couple.My favorite series just to give my opinion of this series context; Mr. Robot, The leftovers, Fargo, Dark, Altered Carbon S1, Westworld s1, Legion, Severance, Night Sky, Utopia UK, Black Mirror too many to list but if you like a few of said shows you will love this 100%.You get attached to most of the characters and note: watch this with subtitles for the full experience as intended.This is probably the most addicting bingable show 11 out of 10 easy.You'll thank me give it a shot.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it's asian made. Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win. The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series.The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next.The story went through well with a good last episode as well. But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The fact that this new series has recently been considered the latest cult hit and the reviews (including the established critics) celebrate this stuff is once again a sign of the stupidity and abstinence from reflection in modern times of the 21st century. So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away. Our world, like ancient Rome, seems to perish on the disgusting hedonism of our time. Have fun and welcome to the Squid Games. I'm out.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is high octane, edge of your seat! I love Korean shows and movies so I wasn't surprised at the violence, however, the violence was waaaaaaaaay over the top. This show really tugged at the heart strings, only to be slapped in the face with another violent end. All in all, I think the movie is an interesting concept. It sure has twisted my memories of childhood games!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series was one of the best series I saw. Acceptable story rhythm and great characterization make you connect with the characters. The excitement and drama of the series is also great. Of course, there are flaws in the series, but the strengths of the series make its weaknesses not visible at all.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series is phenomenal, cruel, big tension and a lot of sad moments. The series also reminds me of the movies called Hostel ( ""the horror ones"") but those films are like a concept if you watch Squid Game, it is like they copied your homework and made it 1000 times better.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I do love Korean music, movies and series. So I'm overwhelmed and happy that Squid Game gets so much hype and is currently the most streamed series on Netflix. I've seen Ig Stories of my friends loving Squid Game. Even though they never watched Korean series or films before.I grant all the success from heart to Hwang Dong-hyuk. His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn't believed in Squid Game.What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.10/10.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made.Nothing really new in the plot. Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment.I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting. Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.A great binge watch!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is the bravest, most intelligent show I've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining.Were there bad plot holes?Yes.Did the VIPs episode suck?Yes.But did that hinder the overall series?No.Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.Pros:
Good actingThe childish games with a twist were funLight plot, easy to follow.Uncomplicated charactersStellar castCons:
VIPs episodePoliceman's story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It's a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It wasn't until episode of the VIPs that I changed to have its original language and subtitles. This totally changed my view of the entire series and I may have to go back and rewatch it particularly because of the poor dubbing in English which the text wasn't bad, it was the inflection and tone that was obnoxious.The last episode is profound and leaves an open for a second series. There is still confusion in my mind over the detective/brother plot line.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game is a bit overrated for me. But its entertaining from the first to the last episode. The storytelling is very good and the ideas of the games are very nice. I liked it.But in comparison to other series there is missing something. I dont regret watching it, but i dont follow the hype.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow. It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee. Dont follow the hype either. Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The survival story is actually pretty good, but it doesn't really surprise me in a way like how a thriller should be able to suprise you. Honestly, I must admit that is too overrated since there are still tons of movies/series with better quality. To me, the story is not that tense and plot twist is also very average for a survival story.However, what I like the most is the emotional effects that you usually find from a K-drama. As a viewer, I am able to understand the characters' backgrounds till they want to sacrifice their life for money. I mean it is very sensible since you can find it in our everydays' life. Obviously, this is a very good point since most survival stories are not that logical and sensible. Well, we can find a lot of life lessons from Squid Game. I think this is one the reasons why it is too overrated despite the average plot twists.On top of that, I really love the 'A Class' actors as the cameos, it's quite surprising though I wish they could involve more. I think instead of the main casts, Gong Yoo is the main trigger why people are so curious to watch it. In other words, A Class cameos are the stars there. Well, I really hope they will bring back Gong Yoo and Lee Byun Hun later on!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"For those who remember the episode of Breaking Bad with the fly. The last episodes were just like that, long dialogue without true story development and not much happening. In my opinion that killed it for me, I was really disappointed. Other then that, I recommend.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
That one episode got me hooked in particular. I rarely binge watch the whole show but I did for this show. There is a reason it is such a mega hit worldwide.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I've just finished the last episode yesterday so I gave myself a day to recollect my thoughts.I don't want to write spoilers but as I see how big is the hype around it it's almost impossible to do so.If you haven't seen any movies with similar message then then you'll probably will give this one higher score for sure.I saw many and have to say that it is a solid 7/10
The character build up starts okay. Later episodes mess up this with the so called VIP's characters are bad. Add bad acting too.The conversations are a bit plain.The storyline is too predictable but not bad.The settings and visuals are very good.The games are good too.The ending is very meh.So these are my thoughts without spoilers.(I watched it in English as I read about it is a slightly different then the Korean original)",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"My ears rang, the never-ending drone of people clamoring on about a new television show, one that raised their expectations of Korean cinema and the content Netflix sponsors. I ignored it for a while, but the incessant noise could only be filtered out for so long - eventually I gave in. The faint tap of the buttons on my Google TV remote echoed through my living room, the silence almost deafening. I sat there for a while, looking at the cover - what did it all mean? I knew, of course, there was only one way to find out - I had to watch it. I had to steel myself; bend my legs, jump on the bandwagon. For a few moments I sat puzzled, wondering why I couldn't grasp the context; my brain was moving at a million miles per hour and skipped over something integral to my understanding of the media - subtitles. The echoes of the remote could be heard again as I navigated the maze of menus to provide me with context to this global phenomenon, something I had managed to avoid for as long as I could.As I sit there, the darkness almost entirely enveloping me (save for the incredible illumination of the 55"" screen on the wall), I began to sink. I sank further and further, my sense of awareness gently escaping my grasp. 001. 199. 218. 456. The numbers revolved around me, my attention skittering between them. Who do I pine for? Who do I despise? Who do I pity? Who do I envy? Even though my mind raced through these questions, it could never find an answer. No, it could never perform any task in its entirety as it was completely and utterly hypnotized by the reel of cinema rolling before my eyes.Eventually, I came to. I looked at my clock: 3:53 AM. How much time had passed since I sat down? I couldn't remember. I picked up my phone and a steady stream of notifications littered my lock screen. I asked myself a different question - how many DAYS had passed? I had been so engrossed in this work of art I lost all sense of being, all sense of time, all sense of life. And yet, I never felt like I missed something, like I had passed on experiences that would have made me feel some semblance of happiness and joy. My life had skipped two days in the blink of an eye and I didn't feel anything. And despite watching the illegible names of several people I knew nothing about in Hangul gently scroll up, I still continued to think about the event I had just witnessed. What happens next? At the moment, I don't know (though, my mind certainly has ideas). But I can only hope that this phenomenon continues, as my mind couldn't take the hit of knowing this would be the only exposure to something so interesting, something so vile yet gripping.So I say to you - stop reading this convoluted memoir and watch it. You eyes may bleed; your mind may shatter - but you will never feel something as incredible as this piece of television.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"We can't deny the fact that this series is pretty much predictable, and the notion that the villain & VIP's were randomly selected, however; I don't regret watching it cz of the thrilling plots and the good developing of characters.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I would give the set design for this series a ""10."" The rest of the show is not very good.Too much of the ""plot"" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the ""head man"" and the cop. You know the last game will be the ""squid game."" There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop ""disappears"" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying ""Be sure to watch Season 2.""All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the ""evil"" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death.""Squid Game"" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and ""Squid Game"" is the umpteenth repetition of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. ""Squid Game"" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"One thing I was sure of, was that the Battle Royale genre was ridden with poor scripting and substandard acting, so I never did watch any of them. And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Yea sorry alert from those ( who I think may have struggled due to language and culture barriers so nobody's fault really ) the series was one of the best things I've been seen . I'm pooped I watch it in two days and I need a holiday . I like to think I cry at things when it's needed but I'm either going though something subconsciously right now or this series just got me ... got me bad... I blubbered at without a doubt the most heartbreaking episode ( 6) I've ever witnessed from a show . I was a mess .... literal snot everywhere and sobbing noises which concluded at the end of the dining episode .. anyways I'm off to chill coz I'm shredded and need to be ok for a wedding this week.

"A group of desperate people agree to play high-stakes children's games, and then find how high the stakes really are. The show is an odd mix of nonsense and excellence. The premise is interesting but the ultimate revelation about the games and their founder is simplistic and does little explain the provenance of the vast, complex yet secret game venue. There are some hints at secondary plotlines but they go nowhere and the introduction of wealthy gamblers is a heavy-handed social-commentary that adds nothing to the story (and leads to the weakest moments in the series). The acting and characters are excellent and the dark shifts in their motives and ethics as more and more players are 'eliminated' is expertly done (episode 6, ""Gganbu"" is a highlight). The imagery, especially the creepy geometric enforcers, the 'play grounds' and the multicolored stairs that look like something from an Escher etching is memorable (and may be what really sets 'Squid Game' apart from similar 'deadly games' series). The film is quite violent, both in a cartoony way and in a more visceral 'realistic' and disturbing way. Not to everyone's' taste but entertaining and compelling.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"In my opinion, ""Squid Game"" is overhyped, and I don't see any other reason than good marketing and viral advertisement.The story is nothing new: game, where the last survivor(s) get(s) the prize. We had seen it in anime, tv-shows, and movies like ""Cube"". Nothing special. What Squid Game does different? Actually, not much. It discloses the motivation of the characters, which is, eventually, irrelevant. It allows to fill half of a season instead of filming 1.5 hour movies.Do I think it's a bad show? No, it's decent and I don't regret watching it. Yet it's quite basic in every possible respect, distinguished by quality of the scenes, but not content..",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"One of the best and most interesting shows I've seen in recent years. I was hooked right from the start. Far out plot, wonderfully unique and layered characters, and a true breakneck pacing that's sure to keep you glued. I went in rather skeptical since hype has often let me down, but I can honestly say I was dead wrong. As soon as the credits rolled on the final episode, I had half a mind to start a rewatch with the new perspective the ending grants.Incredible.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was so intrigued to finally watch this and I managed to avoid spoilers. (Just a heads up this review and my opinions will contain spoilers so please steer clear if you want to avoid them yourself.)The whole concept of this series was pretty damn cool and very compelling. The sets, cinematography, music and character designs as well as their back stories were thought out and exceptionally done. Really amazing.The acting was all really good except for the VIPs... I was looking forward to meeting them so much; who they were and what their experience and involvement was but when they were introduced I feel that the series started to fall apart. There was an immersion that was broken upon their introductions and they didn't really serve any purpose either.All of the games and the main content of this show were really well done but the final three episodes really lost me. I wasn't as interested and the way it ended felt off to me. It wasn't a good wrap up at all. This was disappointing because the first five episodes were really edge of your seat kind of viewing.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them.

"Let's start with the Korean drama that took the world by storm in 2021. I enjoyed this Korean drama, along with many others. However, I felt like it fell flat in the last few episodes. It comments on social status, financial status, and how humans treat one another are hard-hitting. The idea there are people in such financial struggle they would risk their and other people's lives is heart-breaking, yet eye-opening. The incorporation of well-known children's games is a great device used by the creator to connect the audience to the characters. Reminding them of their childhood but also understanding the stress and difficulties of playing these games with such high stakes. I will say the poor acting from the English actors did break the illusion for me, and also ended, which I will not share with those of you that are yet to watch. If you are not a fan of horror and gore I do not recommend this K-Drama for you, another wise I think it's a brilliant watch, but 100% watch in Korean with Subs...Dub is not good.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Had me gripped from the beginning to the end.Some plot lines were signposted v obviously but it was still edge of your seat viewing.

"Many people talk highly of this show, so I had high expectation. It was good but some things made me disappointed. SPOILER ALERT. Too much plot armour for the police. How did he manage to infiltrate the place with so much security? And how lucky he is to be one of the recruit traitor and get the square mask? The Front Man said the biggest value of this game is equality, yet some participants manage to bring in some tools, and peek their game preparation. Ali lost because he got cheated, not through a legit game. So much for equality bruh. Sometimes the recruit is like not exist at all, they supposed to make sure all the participants play fairly. The last game was the most boring game. It's just like watching teenagers fighting pathetically. And the biggest thing that ruined the show is the ending. Gi-Hun suddenly become a high morale person, trying to catch the game organizer that he abandon his daughter! He was introduced as non responsible person, doesn't work hard, and love gambling, why he suddenly need to be so heroic??? He even cheated with the old man.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"What is going on here? How can this show be praised like it is? This series is positively garbage...It's first degree from A to Z, the writing and acting are deplorable (oh the rotten discussions on the meaning of life!), the message distressingly banal, if not non-existent. Manichaeism in all its glory..The choice of music (Blue Danube from top to bottom) to emphasize the decadent atmosphere is pathetically heavy too. I really don't understand what people can find in this interstellar piece of trash that looks like it was written and directed by an 8 year old child, considering how subtle is it.Nothing is credible, everything is predictable, the characters are caricatures (OMG, the ""VIPs""...)What's the so-called great political and social message? That people will do anything for money? That's the great originality of the thing, seriously?I haven't seen anything that ridiculous or grotesque for a long time.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"People have been rightly comparing this gem to the Hunger Games, and to some extent they're right; however, to oversimplify the show as another ""Dystopian Future Game Show"" drama risks looking over the masterful character work, the wildly impressive production design and cinematography, and of course the top-tier acting from everyone involved (yes, that includes the VIPs).Everyone involved in making this, please take a bow.

A little too brutal. It was brutal to the point I had to disconnect, sit back, thinking it's just crazy. Sick.But under all this brutality - incredibly beautiful. As life, as its true beauty you can only appreciate in the context of death. My brain was freaking out. On a subconscious level - I was playing a game. I was barely surviving. I loved and I hated. I was crushed and I was happy.This show was way too original to ignore. Way too fresh.Good idea. Many surprises. OK, I guessed 2 plot twists, but still, it was surprising. Not a cliche. Not ""another show"".Most of the time - completely different experience. Good acting. Interesting characters. Intense action.Yes, I wanted to unwatch this.

Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine ""twist"", but my God, his ""explanation"" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show was incredible. Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else.

"This programme will be dividing viewers opinions the works over, but in my humble one, it is outstanding.A concept that has been done before but never with this level of death and destruction as far as I can Recall.Some of the best drama is coming from overseas currently and we must not forget that every country has brilliant story tellers and filmmakers.If you are watching this in English language then some of the dubbed dialogue will appear awkward and crass but overall it all comes together to make compelling viewing but a few great plot twists within.Maybe this is a one-off series but I feel the door has been left open just enough to bring it back should someone like Netflix decide to pour in more cash. But maybe we do not need another series...",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....

The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the ""game"" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP'sLooking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I really enjoyed the show as a whole, but it was so predictable that it became more and more annoying with every episode, 0 twists and suprises. I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
When I first started Squid Game I didn't expect much. Just something to pass time at work. After the first two episodes I was hooked. The show is thrilling and makes your heart beat increase. I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First off, I wanted to give this show a 7-star rating. As many other comments say, the horrendous, cringeworthy casting of the VIP's drag this down a star in itself. It literally ruined a whole episode. It almost seems surreal just how bad they are at acting.Apart from this though, the show is very gripping with a great idea behind it. Had the idea been executed to perfection, this should would easily be a 9, and maybe even 10. I'm not a big fan of the extreme acting that's often practiced in Korean movies, and this isn't any different. The actors play well, no doubts, but sometimes it's just too much.Scenery, camera-work and story is all pretty well done.But really, what makes this series unique and worth watching is the idea behind it. No matter if you like the korean film-style / acting, you should definitely give this one a watch - you won't regret it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I'm going to keep this short but this show was going amazing right up until the vip episode where it began to crumble to pieces. The plot and the high school theater level acting of the vips made me want to turn off the episode. I still don't think that was worse than the last episode though the ending was way too predictable and I hated what they did with the old man. Overall a good show but they definitely could've wrapped it up better.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Having watched Alice in Borderlands last year which was amazing I was excited about all the buzz about this show. It's entertaining, but the acting is sometimes cringey and other elements drag on like episode 2 when they all go back and decide to return to the game which could've been done in a 15 minute segment. It's fine as a show and entertainment but a stand out show or original it's not. Definitely a case in which social media and buzz has outdone the product.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Just amazing, Korea movies has a kind of emotion express very strong of characters, not like US movies, usually less talking and less face's emotional, just like Parasite movie, also a good Korea movie, I really hope Korean can make more movies like this, very intense, drama and twist, which everybody loves it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I kind a like but it was sad and I don't really like the end...I don't really think I would watch season 2 and the main reason is death of Kang Sae bye and she was great character...,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It's nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I hate violence in movies but somehow could not stop watching this. The story is intriguing - a group of down-in-their-luck men and women were invited to play a series of kids' games that pitted their lives against each other for a prize of billions of wons. I couldn't help wondering whether millions of viewers all over the world also have the same question: if you are up to your neck in debt, would you join the game?I guess the reason I kept watching this despite my aversion to violence is because the violence is necessary to show viewers the horrendousness of greed. It shows how evil love of money is, that one would be willing to die for it. This begs another question: how is this game different from the game millions of people play everyday, sacrificing their relationships, health, principles, dignity and self-respect for jobs and other sources of income?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I watched this show in the original language of Korean with English subtitles.I'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. One big thing I like in shows is morality. Everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. I enjoy Star Trek because of the focus on morals. Same thing with The Orville. This show is no exception.One important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. This is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.Spoilers: The first game involved a deadly game of Red Light, Green Light. Unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. The creators used technology to detect movement. Upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.What got the players to come was potential prize money. Each eliminated player added money to the pot.After the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. Players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. Therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. They barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.However, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. The game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.I don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. My thinking changed during the course of the show.While watching the first game, I'm thinking that I would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so I wouldn't die. I'm hoping I wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.For the second game, I don't know if I would have passed. I might be too scared to try, or I would be too careful and run out of time. Each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.For the third game and even during the riot, I didn't think about what I would do in their situation. I probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.For game four, this opens so many possibilities. Would I sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would I sincerely try to beat the other? What game would I choose? Of course, it would depend on who my partner was. Also, would I to trick the other, so I would survive and move on? I probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.One character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. He wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. One character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. I was thinking along those lines, too.For game five, the first thing I would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. One of the later players ended up doing that. The host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.Many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. It was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. There was a time limit involved. When one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, I got the feeling that the player behind should push him.In summary, this show got my attention and my interest. I was even cheering for some of the characters, and I disliked a couple. The morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. The show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The first 6 episodes are quite strong but it unfortunately gets progressively worse afterwards. The awkward acting by the VIPs introduced in episode 7 was immersion breaking but could have been overlooked given that they are not a major part of the show. Otherwise the episode is still fine and provides satisfying conclusions to the stories of a few supporting characters.Episode 8 concludes the police investigation side plot which in my opinion was the weakest part of the show. We spend a lot of time with the young detective infiltrating the facility but we never get to know him very well, never see him grapple with his emotions or share his motivations with any of the other major characters. Here his story just sort of fizzles out. In the end he has done his job as a plot device revealing some of the evil organization's secrets to the viewer but hasn't actually accomplished anything. The other main characters never even learn he was there in the first place.Episode 8 also kills off Sae-Byeok who is either the show's most prominent side character or its least important main. Unfortunately it's a weak ending for her arc. She gets established as a resourceful badass in the first three episodes smuggling in a knife and crawling through air vents, but ends up being wounded through sheer dumb luck, then killed in a way that further builds the enmity between protagonist Gi-Hun and his childhood friend Sang-Woo. Her character seemed destined for more: If not survival and a reunion with her brother then at least a death more meaningful and less contrived.The ninth episode finally is maybe the weakest of the show. Our main character wins the games as expected and somewhat understandably spends a year wallowing in depression after his traumatic experiences. In a final plot twist it is revealed that Il-Nam, the old man seemingly suffering from dementia whom he has helped throughout the games up to his death (which it turns out he has faked), actually was the big bad all along, the organizer and host of the death games hundreds of people perished in. This obviously recontextualizes every interaction with him we have previously witnessed and in my opinion diminishes his story quite a bit. The story of an old man not willing to wait around for his death may be a bit of a cliche but it was still sad and well executed. As a villain Il-Nam is just another degenerate rich guy little more interesting than any of the other VIPs.Overall the show still has some very strong moments with episode 6 probably the best it ever gets. The final third still leaves a bad taste in my mouth though and brings down what maybe could have been a masterpiece.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (""would you rather"" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of ""red light, green light"" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the ""equality"" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"1-6 built strong momentum.Ep 7 brought in talkative bad English speaking actors that completely killed the mystery and the momentum the show was building. The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious. The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut. The show died there.Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring.Ep 9 total waste of time. Just drags on for too long.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions.

"I feel like the show's overrated. There were too many holes in the story IMO. First of all, does the battery on that officer's phone ever run out? Secondly, how do people go missing (and not just one, but more than 400 each time) and nobody finds out anything? And they have been running the games for years now, so, it is pretty unrealistic. In addition, don't people get flagged for having all that money suddenly in their bank accounts? However, the overall idea of show was something new and exciting. It is worth watching, but there are far better shows out there.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I think this production is the best to ever come out of Asia where the acting's usually dumb and over the top.Here some of Asia's finest acting is displayed I really like how their characters are portrayed.I'm late to the party, after the hype has died but let me close saying the hype was justified.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid Games - Let the Games Begin! This was an extreme bazaar competition amongst willing participants in a progression of children's games where all they have to do is follow the rules to win a huge cash prize. However, they did not know what they were getting into when they signed up and did not know what the meaning of ""elimination"" meant. The episodes are extremely frightening and violent and not meant for anyone other than adults if even that. One criticism I have is the title of the series because it may entice teens to watch it - they might want to see what kind of game this is, and it is clearly not for the unattended child or teen. There was something off about the VIPs - I am not sure if they were supposed to be Americans but if so, they weren't portrayed right as the English isn't the way an American would speak or it is dubbed funny or just something off. I knew there was something more to some of the characters which will be divulged at the ending of the series. The last person standing gets a make-over and looks ridiculous with that bright red hair and if they get on that plane to LA they will be laughed at and called Bozo. I think a more attractive look could have been selected. Only 9 episodes makes this a short series, however Netflix just announced Season 2 so there will be more to come.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"To be honest, the first time I found out about ""Squid Game"" was when I was traveling home and a passenger on my bus was watching it on his cell phone. After doing some research to confirm, I tried to avoid spoilers until I could see it, but in less than 24 hours the entire internet was filled with it. That forced me to abstain from watching the series for a few days until the boom subsided.After finally observing the 9 chapters, I can share the following points. Personally, I really liked the social message that the series shared, of how they gave Korean children's games of the 70s and 80s a dark twist, and the chemistry between the characters and their individual development. I would have easily given it an 8, if not for two downsides.The first was the way the story was told. At first, it was able to take off without any problem but it became unstable until the end of the season, which in my opinion could have been better. Apart from that, the police side-plot must also have been developed better. They gave him considerable screening time, only to stop with a clich챕d Star Wars-type moment? I mean, what the heck?The second is related to the characters. Although the characters had good chemistry with each other and a good, but slow individual development, the same cannot be said about the audience; since they felt a bit generic and the charisma was almost non-existent (especially with the main character).In short, ""The Squid Game"" is not a bad series, but I consider it highly overrated from what I had to see. If in such case Netflix renews it for a Season 2, it is necessary that improvements be made, especially with the writing part. I give it a 6.5/10.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series really gave me goosebumps, thrill, and emotional attachment for the first 5-6 episodes (4th game), then the VIPs come and boom, what's going on?The worst part of this series is the VIPs. Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)Plot twist was so predictable as well.Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"*Roughly Translated From Brazilian Portuguese.Series Review - Squid Game (Season 1).I confess that I went to watch this series thinking it would not be good. As much as she has been voted the most viewed in the world recently, I was too suspicious of her potential, thinking that it could be a shallow plot, just a ""popoc찾o"" to marathon. I was wrong.The show is very balanced, it has a plot, it has good characters, and it grips you in a very smooth way, where you're tempted to keep watching, episode after episode.Overall, it's guaranteed fun. The show's aesthetic alone tells us not to take it too seriously, so don't. Skip the details and have fun.Out of respect for the great old series, which were extremely well done, I won't give it a higher rating, but it's a very good series.Good for a marathon on a Saturday after lunch, alone or with others.Rating: 4/5 - Very good series.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"A new addition to the ""battle royale"" genre, Squid Game adds a refreshing take.The situations in which the characters find themselves is heart-rending drama. I've seen some reviews claim that the show attempts to legitimize the shock value violence by hiding behind a poor veil of human interest/sociology 101, but I honestly find the show gripping, and I finished with genuine interest in the characters portrayed.Be forewarned - it is violent and at times difficult to watch, but if you can get past that, you'll find a gem.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Ok first and foremost hear me out, it's Jigsaw but made in a larger environment, with bigger budget and more techy stuff, with same poorly executed and barely noticeable subtle society criticism. Is it watchable? Yes it is. Is it ground breaking, revolutionary, never seen before kind of story that people will remember and passionately talk about even 10 years from now; like the overhype wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Acting is probably the worst part of this show, characters are hard to believe and sympathize with with almost no character development, the way you see them in the first episode is the way they stay for the rest of it... All in all, for people who for some reason tend to fetishize Korean production and for people who want to be up to date with what TikTok is talking about this is a must watch, for everyone else watch if you want but even if you skip it you're not missing anything.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Watched the whole thing in a day after hearing bout it from others and some guy going its way way way out there the games like I would never have seen before!? SO NOT TRUE the plot story even plant was all Very predictable and we've seen these escape death tournaments a hundred times before usually in a just movie length and with bigger faster action so really this should just be youre average 5 but I gave a extra point as the actors are good . And it does do as a good enough past time. Its just not something that needed to be a series.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I watched the show because it was trending and I couldn't stop until I finished it. The idea behind the show is close to Hunger Games or Battle Royale, it's about a game where people die and there is friendship and betrayal, even if you watched hunger games and battle royale this is still new and a very beautiful show that is set apart.The progression of the characters was beautiful, the acting was very good some say the VIP acting and dialog was bad, I didn't like it either but I think the dialog was meant to be stupid and cheezy like real psychopath rich people would have, it's like a separation from normal people and rich people with a sick mind, so if the VIP disturbed you I think that was the director's plan.The show is pleasing to the eye and ears, even if the players were locked in a place every game was in a different setting and was beautifully designed, the tense music during the games makes you anxious, idk... just watch it already !!!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"If not the best new show on TV--and it may be exactly that--certainly one of the most outrageous. Set in South Korea, it stars Lee Jung-jae as a hardcore gambler in debt to the mob with child support payments he can't maintain and medical bills for his ailing mom that he can no longer afford to pay. When he is offered a chance to make a not-so-small fortune by competing against several hundred other desperate souls in a high-stakes series of childrens' games, he grabs it--with absolutely no idea of what he has signed up for. At first, there's a repetitiveness to it all--everyone competes, the losers are massacred in a horrible bloodbath, the winners move on, rinse and repeat--and, terrifying as the story quickly becomes, you may start wondering if that's all there is. But then episodes six and seven come along, the suspense is ratcheted up even higher, the pool of players is winnowed down to a precious few, and the action really takes off. (Who knew that an ordinary game of marbles could turn into such a nailbiter?) The premise is brilliant, the acting is magnificent (Jung-jae, with his large eyes and expressive face, leads an extraordinarily talented cast), and the stunt work is amazing. Not for the faint of heart--there are more corpses here than at your local boneyard--but if you can stomach the more cringeworthy moments, ""Squid Game"" is quite a ride. The ending is a jaw-dropper, too. It's already been renewed for a second season, and I can't wait.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"People who are in debt are given a chance to free themselves from their burden and earn simply by playing a series of games. Games they had played as children. But the catch is death to all who fail to complete the mission. This implied there would be a single winner who would take the entire cash prize home. The games tested the players' sense of loyalty, truth and honesty. Though cheating was permitted, the games didn't demand mental prowess, only quick thinking and for certain others brute strength and stamina.The series houses a well-known cast from the charismatic Lee Jung-Jae to handsome Wi Ha-Joon to the beautiful Jung Hoyeon. But you would find yourself being most empathetic towards Ali. Ali was done a good number by the person he trusted the most. It was the most unkind game in the series. (this would definitely be a game for the card of hearts in Alice in Borderland. P. S. If you loved Squid Game you have to watch Alice in Borderland)I personally loved the 'Tug of War' game sequence. The gore level is at a 6/10 for me. The series lingers on the absolute need for a season 2 for the unresolved issues of season 1. What happened to No. 29? Will Gi-hun re-enter the games to put a stop to the sadistic butchering pleasure of the investors? Does Gong Yoo have a major role in the entire web of Squid Game?Psst. The K-drama fan in me literally shouts out: Why no why Gong Yoo, why? In a way I'm thankful he makes a cameo as the charismatic recruiter and not as the Frontman.I absolutely recommend this series.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I found Squid Game a hard show to put down. Once you immerse yourself within this show it feels all too real and scary. I find dark shows more engrossing perhaps because they seem realistic and possible. Human nature has a dark and sometimes unforgiving side. This is why shows like Squid game and Black Mirror trend compared to very PG and convenient shows where the good guys always win.Another thing to celebrate here is diversity and globalisation. Squid game, being a Korean show which is set in Korea with Korean actors has broken viewing records. The power of Netflix, through its streaming, has crossed international boundaries and reached so many people. We didn't need to see big Hollywood names or familiar settings in New York or LA. Korea and its brand of actors delivered a great show. Borders in a sense have been broken, coincidentally in a time when a virus physically forces them to close.This show was thought provoking and makes you ask really think about life in general. We're all trying to get rich. But being rich doesn't buy happiness nor does it buy you health.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I had fun binging for two days. It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!Ok, rant over lol.I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other ""stuff"" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don't know is that they might die...I don't know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.Anyway, I won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) It doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it's ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I'm starting to enjoy it, but also it's becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of ""Animal World!"" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who's going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can't pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom's house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they're way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn't find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I'm pretty sure I've had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they've hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I'm right or wrong. It's a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don't use a movie like a precise blueprint, that's just plagiarism!

"I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I understand where people might get bored from the latter half of the show, but if you have some immersion and enthusiasm it really really pays off.Not only does the music drastically improve, but the series itself also takes a more serious and dark approach both in the cinematography as well as the writing towards the end, in stark contrast to the silly and dramatic moments in the first few episodes.If you are able to keep track of the all the side characters individual stories and motivations i think the end really brings it home with a nice and engaging ending.The dark turn in seriousness is precisely why this show is unique and contrarian to many other similar shows/movies like the Brazilian show 3% or something like the hunger games.I personally believe this show is very well at showing how seemingly innocent and simple people can turn into something dark and violent in the span of only a couple of days.The only big problems i have with this show are
1. Over dramatic characters like Mi-Nyeo as well as Gi-Hun in the first couple of episodes.2. the obvious answer of the VIPs. Utterly terrible and inexcusably horrendous writing.3. the absolute absurdity of the soldiers/staff behaviorisms. Many of the characters we somewhat get to know are all the same. Pretentious, annoying and ridiculously neurotic.With that being said, these problems are very minor in the grand scheme of things. The last episode completely redeems the major issues in the previous ones with a very interesting atmosphere that will linger after you are done.The character development of Gi-Hun, Oh Ill-Nam's reveal and Kang Sae-Byeok's sibiling being cared for all in the same latter half of the last episode really makes this show give you a sense of nostalgia for some reason. Maybe not for everyone, but it definitely did (especially because of the perfection of music in the last episode. If not for the music, this show would've been a 6.5-7).All in all i think that if you are able to effectively immerse yourself in the story, with a considerable deal of patience then this series is unquestionably an 8-10.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind.

"Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.8/10 for Season 1.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First off the main character is unlikeable. I wasn't rooting for him the entire show. He's not exactly a good person and came off as annoying.Second, it took a LONG TIME for anything interesting to happen. The establishing backstory was very boring and very unnecessary. They could have told us everyone's stories in a couple of quick flashbacks and gone straight into the action!Third, this is not an original concept. I've seen this type of social commentary done a thousand times in a thousand different ways.Do yourself a favor and go watch Alice in Borderland. It's a much better show.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses ""Hunger Games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I found it pretty sleepy.

And this was hype.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn't even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure.

"I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid's games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...This really didn't do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they're setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don't think it needs to go there to begin with.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the clich챕 and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"When i first heard about this show, the first thing that came to my mind was Money Heist. And not exactly a robbery with a lot of unnecesary extra seasons. I thought huge budget spend on set, CGI and entertainment while the dialogue and storyline is given to the bunch of guys who knows how to do a lame predictible money maker series.I gave it a try and after watching the first episodes i started to think that i might made a judgement mistake.For a moment i was caught in it's mistery, unpredictable events and complex moral issues. You get to judge the competitors while at the same time realize you would probably do the same monstrosity's they are commiting. You see great acting, scenes that make you fantasize abouth the old days in South Korea when all of them where playing these infantile games without their debts, guilt and traumas. Even tough i'm no korean and never been in Korea, i felt nostalgia.Then, the show starts to have a few flaws in matters of coherence wich you try to ignore to keep having a pleasent experience. And for moments, you do. You try to understand the unnecesary plot about the young police who extremely easily breaks into a secret, dangerous facility runned by a cruel, wealthy organization who seem to have been running this games without problem for at least 2 decades. If that's not enough, the showrunners give you a terrible, incoherent explanation about his missing brother. It's almost like the tape of the series came by mistake with a few Mission Impossible scenes in the middle of it.There's a few scenes and clich챕 dialogues that makes you wonder if the series is looking to play safe as another hit in terms of Netflix views, or more as the daring, complex drama that was, at least, what i was expecting it to be.My other problem was that after 5 episodes i realized i wasn't empathizing too much with the characthers (with the exception of competitor 001, of course).And then i arrived at the Climax of the series. Episode 6. The moral concept is taken way beyond in this game as competitors pick their closest partner without knowing that they're gonna have to eliminate each other. You get to see the real face of all the characthers and the cast best perfomances. There's a lot of betrayal, hesitation, tension, characther exploration and development, and of course, the heartbreaking endings to each of the main eliminations. It was a perfect ending for Jy-Yeong, Ali and the old beloved 001.After that perfect episode, you are blown back to reality and the shows continues to fell apart.1.- One of the more interesting characthers of the show, Sae-Byeok get's fataly injured in the more stupid and meaningless way.2.- The plot of the police guy confirm's itself as totally unnecesary.3.- The closure of the games it's no much more than decent.4.- The plot twist about the old man being the host of the games is just stupid and gave bad closure to a characther who had originally a great arc.5.- The last scene where the protagonist doesn't take the plane in order to fight against the whole organization by himself?? Am I a watching John Wick or something? What about the daughter he promise not to lie anymore and take care of? It seems like they destroyed all his characther development.It seems like, this show had everything to be a cult classic and instead preferred to be the popular easy to digest Netflix hit i was expecting it not to be.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.This is not just another play a game of death story.Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Is this show art or sadistic hype? Or just criticism of capitalism? The cynical display of social injustice in Squid Game is not a pose. The South Korean screenwriter and director Hwang Dong-hyuk came up with the idea for the series during the 2008 financial crisis - brutally and directly.The series is a criticism of the world as it is. A double-edged sword. The protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - an unemployed chauffeur who slipped into gambling addiction after losing his job - depends not only on the prize money to gain custody of his daughter, but also to one to pay for an important operation for his mother. He becomes part of a show for life and death.A mass extinction staged by Netflix. Is this good or bad? You can look at it, even if a lot is reminiscent of Stephen King.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad.

"This will be your thorough start-to-end review. I am going to mention that this series got right, and everything it got wrong. I am rating it a 5 overall. It's a solid 8 for the first 5 episodes, and just ONE star for the remaining episodes. You'll understand why.And in advance, excuse me for my not-so-good English. (Im not native).Overview:
This series was a risk to take, the director knows that very well. It's very bloody, and the centerpiece of the plot deals with a rather sensitive idea. It was no problem because it was handled as it should be, not perfectly but, it was good and enjoyable, until it started falling apart and the bad outweighed the good.The Good:
The idea is great. If you have watched this series, you must have a faint idea about why this had so much buzz in such a short time. The whole concept of ""Hunger Games"" style, being played by the wealthy but not forced to do so, as well as the kids' game as their theme, did pretty well in the first episodes. It was fair, square, and it lived up to its own concept.There were stereotypical characters, and others really well-written, the entire cast is great, memorable, and there are characters who you would root for. All characters had a common thing between them, financial misery, and that money can solve all problems, yet they had some depth to them. It's not the best character writing but it sure did the job.The atmosphere was so great during the first 5 episodes, you can actually LIVE in the shoes of the characters, you can see what they see, you can feel it, you start actually relating to them. It's all great, it's what the series is meant to do.The acting for most characters was great, the dialogue is smart (I watched it in fan-subs, as the original subs didn't do it for me).The Bad:
The main character is kind of ""stale"" to me, it's not really someone I'd care about, he is a loser, and he is set out to be one all the series but he ends up winning just like that, he gets this psychological breakdown after he wins, but it just feels so not right. The main character is just wrong. I am pretty sure everyone shares the same opinion. It's not about the actor, but the director didn't really get so clever about managing his MC's fa챌ade it felt flat.It becomes predictable towards EP 6: You start wishing something unpredictable happens. Most characters just die during the 4th and 5th game, and there's not much to see after that.It deviates from its concept: Kids game, right? That's what made the first 4 games great, as soon as they deviated from that logic, it started feeling like a different series, ones we didn't sign up for, nor did we want.The Ugly:
Remember the policeman who played spy to look for his brother? Such a really long side-plot for what? We watched him infiltrate the island but for what? He gets shot off by his own brother, nothing happens afterwards. We sure haven't seen him die but something about the entire side plot should've happened during the first season because it took a lot of screentime of the FIRST season. Simply leaving it for a second season after it took so much time from the first season is just ridiculous and kind of greedy. Also, being shot by his own brother is really clich챕.VIPs: This is a grand ""kek"", they were just very bad and a pain to watch. Nothing about them really adds anything to the series, they had so much potential, and the air of mystery about them faded away poorly as soon as they started talking nonsense. I get the director wanted us to hate them, but this bittered the drinkNothing gets resolved: This is the big downside of the entire series: So WHAT. They want to enforce the fact the money doesn't buy happiness, it does buy happiness. But that's not the point, because the contestants CHOSE to partake in the blood fest. Yet somehow the MC kept whining and whining seeing people die. What the hell? You signed up for it, you get what you wished for, lolz.Last game is a buzzkill: They should've come up with a better 1 on 1 game. It was already a big let-down when they killed off the girl like that, but seriously? Suicide? After all he went through ? So freaking stupid.The last 3 episodes just killed a lot of braincells in my head. It felt like the director and the writers just turned the switch of thinking in their brain OFF. I couldn't help but feel so bad for not just skipping to the end of the last episode.All in all, it was fun to start with, and kind of an ultimate disappointment in the end. But it's still good, totally worth your time but no way in hell does it come close to the best 100 series ever.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before.

This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:
some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part.

"As per my title this isn't a very original idea. It's been done time and time again: Highlander (1986), Battle Royale (2000), The Hunger Games (2012), Animal World (2018) etc. The only difference is the venue/place where they are held and the winnings at the end.I tried to watch this when it first appeared on Netflix, but after 3 episodes it still hadn't impressed me, and was quickly forgotten when I found something better to binge watch. After seeing all the hype about it I decided to give it another go, perhaps I should have given it 4 episodes? Nope it still didn't impress.I have to question the '111 million fans' claim by Netflix. I'm more inclined to believe it is 111 million 'Viewings' that include the multiple viewings by single individuals or their group friends at home or around at their friends houses when their parents are away. Viewings do not correspond to fans.The acting is your usual frenetic Korean overacting, overdone facial expressions combined with family honour/disappointment.The main characters, although given back stories, aren't what you would consider likeable so you don't really invest too much empathy into who will or won't survive, bearing in mind that 'There can be only one' (to quote Highlander) winner at the end of the game.My only real interest was in working out who was behind the whole setup of 'Squid Game' and who the 'Frontman' was. The clues are there and it didn't take me too long to have a (correct) working theory.I suppose if you are looking for some 'bloody' entertainment, that you can disengage your brain to watch, then this will meet your needs.I gave it a generous 6 stars as while it isn't as good as it is hyped to be it certainly isn't as bad as some of Netflix's underwhelming prior offerings.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments.

"Pros
* interesting premise
* atmospheric
* some of the acting is very well done
* some character development is well doneCons
* character personalities change at random
* some over the top acting
* some overly stereotypical characters
* premise doesn't have any real foundation
* it ignores the potential sociocultural insightPros
The story underneath it all is an interesting one. The same general idea isn't a unique one (eg. It's similar to Brazil's ""3%""), but the my build in enough sub-plots, mystery, and kind of cliffhanger endings, for it to have a fair bit of intrigue.The setting also works. Real life scenes in the city are mostly either dark or grey, contrasting with the childlike bright colours and symbols of the games. It's definitely quirky and somewhat atmospheric.Cons
But that's all let down by some weak acting, annoying voice actor in the English dubbed version, and characters either who are too stereotypical or whose personalities change in a whim.There's some decent acting and character development as well, but it's way overdone (exaggerated facial expressions and 'tantrums') by the main character and a several of the stereotypical ones are where the acting is really overdone.By the end, when they start revealing the motivations behind it all;m, it gets pretty weak, stereotypical (again), and exaggerated.In addition to this, there's so much potential for a political or sociocultural commentary. So much scope to address the changes in kids habits (from active and interactive physical and outdoor games and the creativity of making up new ones, to iPad and PC screens all day long). And more so, to address the poor dying and struggling to survive to make money that for most is never actually within their grasp, while the rich do nothing but exploit them. (The latter is what ""3%"" does really well). But the dialogue doesn't really touch on the issues at all. More focus on blood and guts than on any potential insight.Overall, too many characters make no sense, and it ultimately feels hollow in the end.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i'll watch another series if they make one.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I continue to be impressed by Korean shows and movies. I really love them. This is a great show that I hope will go on. The characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The best show I've seen in years.....the characters are rich, the story is nuts, crazy, emotional, and brutally violent.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I did not expect it to be so good! This series shows the depths of human behavior, reminded me for a moment Black Mirror.Just watch and you won't regret it. I'm becoming a fan of Korean movies and series. They know how to do the job.Wonderful script, Intriguing,funny, touching and frightening All at once.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Don't believe the hype.Don't get me wrong, the show was entertaining and watchable, the cast mostly did a good job, the visuals were good.I liked it. But that's it. I just liked it. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't anything new to me, I won't remember this as a great show, I won't remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won't agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Literally had to stand up from my coach and pace, it's so intense and very well done!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was really enjoying this series until the last episode... it completely threw out the awesome character arc of the protagonist to set it up for a second season when it was obviously supposed to end of a semi-downer ending... which would have been effective and great.This film isn't that original. It really bugs me that American audiences find this to be so ""unique"". This concept has been used in many plots... for a long time... Especially in Asian cinema. So everyone should just relax.Still, this is a pretty great series. I just feel sorry for anyone that has to watch the last episode...",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Nice and innovative concept of this korean web series. From start to end it is nice to watch. Also very emotional at the end. Very few series has such a new concept.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I get the hype around this series, I just don't agree with it.It's about a game that consists of multiple kids games. If you win one of those games, you go to the next round, but if you lose, you die. The person who wins the last game gets all the money.The plot is basic and unoriginal. I feel like everyone can come up with it and it reminds me of a lot of other films I've already seen.The worst thing about it, is that it's too predictable. I could already tell who would die and who would win after watching the first episode. That made it not exciting of course, because I was never scared for people to die. There were plot twists, but they just didn't surprises me and it wasn't as emotional as people said it was. I haven't shed a single tear, while I normally cry a whole ocean when I watch a simple Disney film.I'm not saying this is the worst thing ever, maybe it just isn't for me. I don't regret watching it, but I'm not waiting for a second season either.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Low effort program basically designed to entertain simple people who like to watch people die. Not even remotely good, the bar continues to sink.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This drama is probably one of the most compelling battle royale content out there. The last episode was a bit boring as it tried to set up a bridge towards season 2, but overall the dram has a really interesting storyline.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I liked it overall BUT:
The VIPs acted terrible and their script was super cringyIt was kind of obvious that the old man was the creatorThe police side-story didn't really have a purpose. At lesst not for this season.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The series is great and worth the watch. I have to admit I already called the twist by the second episode, but the journey was great. The latter part of the season lost its way with some heavy cringe characters but I'll look past that. My biggest gripe comes with the latter part becoming clich챕 and in violation of what previous episodes had laid down, as in everyone has a fair shot at winning whereas the game they played was in gross violation of that (episode 7). Give it a watch though.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"""Squid Game"" is a show meant to appeal to its viewers twisted inner child. It's not just the games themselves, but the brightly coloured, oversize playground in which the players are forced to live and compete. The storytelling is relatively simple and straightforward. And the satirical elements about the evil billionaires who come to bet on the game can at times feel like how a grade schooler.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Honestly, I did not find the point of anything. The games made no sense, killing the people made no sense, the motive behind the games made no sense and the cherry on the cake were the VIPs! ?쁻 Absolutely hilarious. If you want to watch a dystopian society then the first hunger hames and the first book maze runner are pretty decent comparatively. But this did not work for me. I need to watch something really nice to chance my mood.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
This is the first Korean web series I've ever watched in my entire life and I watched it just because everyone were talking about it and everyone were appreciating it and that's why I watched. Must watch series full of drama and good story. Overall good experience watching this series.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"But the main takeaway from this series is never trust an old man. Besides that, there are lot of bad human habits exposed of course, and also unexpected situations that made this a solid nine for me, some things could have been better (i.e. The main character old friend is way too sadistic in most of the cases) but is truly a footage of the human being in the world.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"From the very first episode, it was obvious the series would be great. Nicely paced, full of suspense and drama and great acting.The last episode was however a bit anti-climatic. The conclusion went against the most important thing the protagonist had been fighting for the entire series.A great series in all and a worthy watch.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I've watched Korean Dramas since my 17 years old and finally the world understands how powerful they are. The story, the acting... PERFECT. They have the hability to make you feel all the emotions at once.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I confess to watching every episode before realizing the characters were an overused, worn-out personality mix, the plot was predictable and the hundreds of assassination style killings were the central plot driver.But still part me enjoyed the novelty, the exposure of human fragilities and the bright color sets and costuming.The product is not that great, the remarkable popularity might be explained by the economic desperation many of us feel right now and perhaps it taps into a growing resentment toward the financial elite.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Episode 6 really got me hard.Only thing is the subtitles need to be improved.Never had this many tears. Amazing series!,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clich챕s, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):
What are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)
3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:
The plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Definitely watch this! After the first episode I was absolutely glued to the programme, I watched 5 episodes in one go, it was that good.Personally I preferred to watch it in the original language Korean with English subtitles, I believe it makes the programme much more believable.The American dubs were just awful.Fantastic acting by all. It has 2 brilliant twists at the end too!Enjoy!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It started way much better than it ended and by mid-season the series had too many useless long scenes that didn't help the drama...The characters build up was good and most of the main characters has depth but all the events are way way too predictable and in too many instances you waste 5 or more minutes of watching things you already know it will happen with no twists happeningAlso at the first few episodes it had meaningless flashbacks to things happened literally 3 mins before which made feel weak and and shallow...,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Dystopia theme, cool aesthetics, and ""deep"" ideas do not automatically make something good!!!To be fair, Episode 1 is funny: slapstick and dark humour. And the overall concept, deadly games, is cool. But that's about it. This series is BADLY ACTED, BADLY SCRIPTED, and CRINGEWORTHY throughout.Over-acting makes it hard to take any *deep* conversation seriously.Many conversations are too long and unnecessary - as if the director's just killing time until the next game (the games seem to be the only thing he's good at.)There's some overly dramatic scenes that aren't built up to enough by the plot (e.g. Everyone tries to massacre each other in the night in episode 2 already - before they even got chance to start hating each other...).Many scenes are plain clich챕/cringeworthy. Would YOU cry your eyes out at the death of the ""bad guy"" who's just murdered your lady? Cry and cry at your nemesis's death, because you're such a ""good guy""? Ridiculous.The final twists are unnecessary and annoying. I'd rather have seen some better quality acting and scriptwriting throughout.I could say more, but can't be bothered wasting any more time. I already lost 8 hours watching this - and 598 brain cells.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"What a unique, entertainingly disturbing concept. The writing was well done and kept the watchers guessing with lots of twist and turns. You feel for individual characters struggling to survive that many people can relent too. The games are simple yet disturbingly twisted which keeps
You wanting to see what comes next. Two thumbs up!!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Creat cinematography. Excellent story line. Great acting!Very interesting take on showing human nature and how twisted it is.At first, I wasn't interested in watching it but after the first episode I was hooked. Amazed after every episode with how intricate this is entire concept is.This series is full of big and small details which could be missed if not paying attention.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show is the best show I have ever watched. I enjoyed it more than breaking bad, SOA, even game of thrones. Part of the reason why it is my favorite show was the AMAZING set design and art department. Each set looked like the spent millions and millions of dollars and it was so unique and absolutely amazing! Very gory and violent sometimes in a comical way. I love it. Can't recommend enough.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I liked the beginning of the series. It starts off strong and catches the attention of the audience from the 1st episode itself.It gets a bit boring in the middle, but picks up and the plot line continues to be interesting after that. I think 5th episode is a bit boring; other episodes are actually good and fast-paced.Its very good from the 6th episode till the start of the 9th episode. 9th episode is the final episode and I was expecting some big reveal and some interesting backstory as to why they were conducting the Game. But the reason behind the games is a bit disappointing and lacklustre with the reason being some rich people feeling bored and hence, conducting the Game. So finally, I felt like the series was not that great because of the simplistic ending.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"If you can deal with the graphic violence you'll enjoy a well acted, well directed mini masterpiece about the human psyche, desperation, relationships, greed, selfishness and sacrifice. Refreshing to watch after all the predictable dross out there. Just about long enough too. Recommended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I enjoyed Squid Game but feel it's rather overrated. I've been a big fan of far eastern and in particular Japanese and Korean movies for many years. Lady Vengeance and Oldboy in particular stuck with me. So many people have been talking about Squid Game, I was expecting a little bit more. When you know there are twists, even ones you don't expect, they don't really come as a surprise.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I don't watch many foreign shows or movies, but with all the popularity surrounding this show I just had to watch it. ""Squid Game"" is a very engaging show that keeps you hooked in with its various twists and surprises that keep you watching. While the last episode failed to satisfy some aspects of the series, it still wrapped things up nicely and did a great job of showing the consequences of a society were the rich are the only ones who benefit. Very excited for season two.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc. Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes.Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series will take you out of you mind!!From the storyline to the direction, even the colours make a huge impact to what you see.Until the end that the struggle of the two main characters (001 the one who thought of all this game) and 256 (who actually won the game) one thing was sure. Money is not the solution to all your problems. You see...001 had so much money but couldn't buy time to live longer since he had cancer and 256 when finally got all the money he dreamed of, his best friend and a woman who truly cared was dead, not to mention that when he came home his mother run out of time and was also dead because she suffered from diabetes. He had money but he was all alone.The series will give you another prospective of what life is for some people, but keep in mind that is also violent,brutal and bloody.For me is absolute must see.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I adored this show, the colour theme was absolutely phenomenal and so aesthetic YET terrifying, however... the VIP's could not act, but i'm not going to let the VIP's spoil the entire show.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This Korean drama shows up Hollywood in every way. By the third episode, the viewer is totally immersed in the characters' struggles, because this is just good writing. Each character is more and less than they appear to be. We have fascinating and necessary back stories, which make the action incredibly poignant. This is not, as many critics have claimed, a gory show. It's no more violent than something like Game of Thrones. Less so, as the main violence is people being dispatched by gunfire. I do think the last few episodes weren't as good as the first ones, but I suspect they're planning a follow-up season, so much was left unexplained. Great show that really explores human nature, both the good and the bad.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
A Geat series after many years!! Must Watch. Would like to see season 2.. Cant wait.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It grew on me after the first episode, it was somehow addictive so that must say something about me. It lost it's appeal when the VIP's were introduced, rich American businessmen who pay to see people get killed, I get that that is the story but the really bad acting and dialogue of these guys was cringeworthy. Shame, because the Korean/Pakistani cast were exellent, each and every one of them.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Episodes 1-6 were addictive, intense, original, clever and shocking. Genuinely incredible TV.Episodes 7-9 had some good twists but overall empty and missing that something special.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Sometimes the story got a bit slow but you must keep watching! It is worth it.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
It's definitely not usual korean drama. It doesn't have any romance or any thing. So any one even who don't like korean drama can enjoy it.If you like escape room or Alice in boarderland it is definitely your kind of series. Story is simple a group of people play children's games and who loses will die. Even it is children's games it will keep you at the edge. That's also the speciality of the series.This series will never going to disappoint you It's worth every bit of your time.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off...",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The challenge is to get the end without the need to shoot yourself in the head! Acting pretty cringeworthy and drawn out far too long! Nice cinema photography though!,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Really enjoyed this. Thought it was just going to be full of blood and guts (which there is alot of) but actually I found myself getting invested in the characters and enjoying the moral dilemmas the characters have to make. Looking forward to a second series.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Simply Genius... A masterpiece... Its a must watch webseries.... Grt performance by each and every character...
Waiting for season 02.. korean webseries are never disappoints..",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was very surprised by the quality of the storytelling. This story is like a parable, like Greek mythology, a simple story with a message, to make a point that life is not fair. We are not all equal, luck plays a big part in our successes and failures, and ultimately we are in a state of stupor going about our daily rituals, seeking something we don't have, driven by greed which in turn is driven by the desire to have fun and escape boredom, and some of us will do anything if we are given permission to do it and are rewarded for it. This story of humanity is universal, and can be told in a million different ways. The Squid game tells this story in its own way.I think people are horrified at what humans can do to another person, but history has shown us that time and time again, most people are capable of the most awful things if they are scared, alone, are at one point powerless, and then at another point, given power and rewards. It takes a very special person to rise above this. Very special indeed. And if you think you are that person, you are most likely mistaken. This is why the ending of this series is so unpredictable, because out of the ashes, from the depths of despair, can arise a person who is not compelled to be bound by the arbitrary rules set by the powerful, someone who makes all the difference to others, who can see the truth, at last. It is no accident therefore that the writers have juxtaposed religion here and there and 'Jesus?' is asked at the right moment. Very clever in all respects. Thank you to all involved.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Very good tv show as i expected from the Korean shows but i think the storytelling is not very well although the characters are well written
And i liked the Design and Music also some twist events.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The premise is interesting end entertaining. However, the character development is very poor and random (ie. Characters decide to suddenly become ethical out of nowhere and despite it contradicting their whole previously established traits).The justification behind the games is also very underwhelming even though it was meant to be some kind of big reveal.This show gives very much a ""we live in a society"" vibe... Some plot twists feel like they were written by a 12 yo middle schooler.I don't know if it's the norm for Korean shows but sometimes the acting feels cartoonist although most of the time the acting is pretty strong. Also beautifuly shot.6/10 don't believe the hype.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I enjoyed watching the series but it's just way overrated.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter's birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I'm part Korean.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Its amazing. Just stop reading reviews and start watching now.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Yes the show was super entertaining and had you engrossed, and might even go on to become Netflix's most watched show, but for viewers who have seen enough cinema, there was nothing ground breaking here.The overall plot about rich people being bored so using poor people for entertainment - that's been done. The final revelation the old man gave was quite cliched.What was the point of the entire sub plot with the cop looking for his brother? He turns out to be the main guard, but so what? That seemed quite a pointless chase.Half the games were quite boring to be honest.As enough people have mentioned here, the VIPs were a shocker. It was quite expected that the games were being funded by a crew of rich bored people for entertainment, but those actors and their dialogue gets a 0/10.Still, the show had great acting and fun characters, but the plot could have been WAY tighter.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Series full of suspense and thrill.....but subtitles were not up to the mark.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It starts very weird as the concept is quite abstract, the violence is sudden and spectacular and some of the acting is very OTT. However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a 'shocking twist' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Woow. Am shocked! Amazing sereies. Defined beauty.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Really nice idea, but I think it would've worked better as a movie. Maybe even a movie series? Even in 9 episodes I didn't get that bond with the characters, so I would've just leave some out. I think there was a lot of unnecessary scenes for such a short season. I didn't really see the policeman finding his brother very necessary for example. The old man was really a key for this one, he really saved the whole series at the end. All in all this movie still gets 6/10 because of the great casting, visuals, set and the idea.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's a 10/10. Just edit out the VIPs, you don't need them at all. Loved it. A masterpiece.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.Highly recommended.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Despite the hype, the plot is not original. It is a mixture of SAW, Cube, The platform and other similar films. It is kind of entertaining (if that could be said about a gore film) with a few nice plot twists, although some of them overstretched...Moreover, it depicts a version of the average South Korean with major financial issues, which I do not know if it is accurate or an exaggeration. Don't believe the hype. It is just another ""ok"" series.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid Game is an enjoyable and visually pleasing show, but it's definitely not a ""good"" show. It's no different from any other generic thriller made by C-grade directors who never made a movie with a score higher than 6. Being a true follower of this genre, Squid Game made most of the same mistakes such movies usually make: too many plot holes, illogical and poorly thought out scenes, unfairly manipulating people's emotions for shock value, etc. However, the show manages to do one thing most other ""bad"" movies never accomplished, and that's shamelessly manipulate the viewer's emotions for cheap tear-jerking moments, that despite being unbelievably predictable (such as most things in this movie), still manage to affect many people.To be fair, I was actually quite surprised when I found out that the director/writer of the show, Hwang Dong-hyuk, presumably worked on this script for years. It looks like something an inexperienced film-maker who never attended a filmmaking school would make. It seems like he simply took bits he liked and that worked well in other movies, and decided to combine them into one tv show. The thing is, this constant jump from one bit to another, stripped the show from any meaning. It's an extremely superficial show which tries very hard to be deeper than it is. Though I wouldn't hold it against this show, even though it makes me laugh whenever the director is mad when someone is criticizing his talentless piece of work.With that being said, there's nothing wrong about it not being a good show as long as it's enjoyable, and it definitely is. The difference is that despite liking it, I won't put it among the good movies I like, but rather with the other bunch, where you can find movies such as the Saw and various action-driven movies - bad but fun.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"For the hype and reviews it is worrisome that the collective thinking sees no issues with this kind of cinematography . The movie industry, Netflix and the South Korean Squid Game series is made to globally desensitize the human population. Violence is presented as normal. The profound perversion of it all that glorifies the sick mind who produces these horrors without regard for the consequences this may bring? A global reception with laughter and excitement. Take some time out and think. There are voices, not only in South Korea that do not take lightly the dangerous degeneracy and wickedness with which Hwang Dong-hyuk fundamentally tainted every child's game. Already we are seeing the growing gangs of kids using violence as a game. The movie industry is not innocent when it comes to social mayhem. We saw the first mass hysteria and destruction of society as a result of the movies during the the William Monroe Trotter era. The cultural advances made by the North were completely destroyed and the South was able to rule the country while Hollywood did its part to facilitate. How movies and the media trigger trends and influence the peace and violence in society is greatly understated. Everyone knows that gambling kills. What is the rational reason behind this corruption of children games turning into a mass slaughter as a sport of the rich labeled as art, set to win nominations? The perversion that Man can hunts animals for sport has now extended into the realm that man can hunt man for sport? With his version of a Squid Game, that is nothing more than a variant of the Hunger Games, Hwang Dong-hyuk biggest achievement is the desensitization of the masses, the numbness of the senses towards violence. Viruses tend to mutate. Mental viruses behave likewise. About the ending, when the gambler fails to board the plane to see his daughter, this is probably the sole scene that adequately describes the suffering of society, the sickness of gambling, loans, artificially induced poverty and the sadism of those that exploit it - beginning with religions-. Apathy is the greatest human disease.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the ""twist"" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"A drama that works as a critique of wealth disparity, with hundreds of desperate people brought together on a mysterious island to compete for a big cash prize, not knowing what the games they are about to play will entail. When they do understand it, we see some of the inevitable behavior from a group of people under great stress, including violence towards one another amidst scattered bits of humanism. What kind of individual can survive in such a dog eat dog environment, and what does it do to them, the series has us ponder. Meanwhile, the elite sit back and enjoy the spectacle, having set up an ominous power structure of men behind masks to keep everyone in line, and to kill when necessary. It's clearly a metaphor for the human condition under extreme forms of capitalism.There are lots of great characters here, starting with Lee Jung-jae, #456, the gambling addict who owes a lot of money and had his wife take their daughter and leave him for another man. O Yeong-su (#001, the elderly man), Park Hae-soo (#218, his childhood friend), and Heo Sung-tae (#101, the vicious gangster) all shine, and the series did a good job of letting us see their back stories. That's true of the female characters as well, who I really liked here, including Kim Joo-ryoung (#212, the wildly effusive con), HoYeon Jung (#067, the sullen North Korean defector), and Lee Yoo-mi (#240, who killed her abusive stepfather). The plot easily could have been too simple and linear, but through these characters and some of the subplots, like the illicit business set up by some of the guards to sell organs, it was able to keep itself larger than the sum of its (violent) parts.I found that it also worked as a critique of voyeurism (including the viewer!), for while one may think of the barbarity of the Roman Colosseum while watching this as something distant from themself, one is inevitably drawn to the incredibly cruel games, wondering who will survive. I thought it might have been a teeny bit more effective had the VIP's not been present in the later episodes though, since their dialogue was so shlocky and it seems to me that a lot of ultra-powerful are often more hidden in the real world. I just imagined that a call at the end from the Front Man (the overseer) which alluded to him answering to others and a larger structure might have been more sinister and powerful. No matter though. This is an entertaining series on several levels, and kept those of us watching it guessing as to what would happen moment to moment. I hope the following seasons are able to keep up with fresh social commentary, and not devolve into the spectacle of the games.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It was very good and thrilling at the beginning, but on episode 6 I noticed how long the dialogues and things were taking and I actually fell asleep because it was tedious. For some reason I didn't even get emotional on that episode, just felt like some things didn't even make sense.From that on, I was more interested on the police officer's plot than actually the games. And this is another thing that didn't even get closure. If you're not certain there'll be another season, you can't just let things unfinished.The ending didn't get me and somethings didn't make sense (like that hair?). It was obvious his mother would be dead by the time he got home, I knew it since episode 2.There are some CLEAR nods (maybe even copy?) to The Hunger Games movies, such as the song that is played to the characters (even though it's a classic song, it was very clearly copying the Panem Anthem idea), the score soundtrack of the series while the game is going on (very similar to the movies), even some camera shots and the VIPS watching the games and betting on players.

I can't digest that he could so easily swoop the whole facility and got caught on a distant island instead.The morse code thing, what was is about?He had sent proofs about the games to the police via his super long-lasting iphone but still nobody does anything for an year?So basically his character development goes in vain. Gets killed by his own brother and couldn't do anything about the game.2. At the end, the three finalists had been given one knife each. What if 2 people would have got killed? If yes, there would have been a winner without even playing the last game. What's the point of such scheduling, planning and discipline. It doesn't make sense.3. The glass shattering scene at the end of the game was totally unnecessary and senseless. What if they killed all their participants unknowingly? There would be no games at all, no winner?4. VIPs were totally unnecessary. They didn't even show their betting properly. After all, at the end it turns it was all for fun but we never saw that enthusiastic gambling from the vips.There are more but I guess I can remember this much only as of now.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Now, onto the shoe itself which was an absolute blast from start to finish. Believe the hype, it genuinely is that brilliant and the acting is on point. The characters are very well developed and you start to grow to like certain characters as the series unfolds. It's over the top violence and a little far fetched, but you are watching a TV series for entertainment, not to be educated. For all the 1* reviews. Ignore them. These are people that deliberately don't rate a show because it's popular and trend.

I'm sure there will be more seasons but I'm not sure how they will make it something different so time will tell.Lots of gore, some jump moments, a small amount of sex and nudity.Some of it was predictable but then there were a certain amount of clues that not everyone will pick up on.Recommended.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

It's a great highlight in this series.Very emotional and thoughtful, a clear evolution of characters is seen, with the games and their companions.I read just today (I finished it last week) that they plan to do a second installment and that they are already ruminating ideas ...

"Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions ""betrayed"" by only the twitching of one eye.Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This show, about hundreds of cash-strapped players who accept a strange invitation to compete in children's games, is a unique show because of its interesting concept.First of all, except from the concept, the cinematography and the editing were fantastic. Almost flawless from my experience. The show was generally quite exciting, and pretty unpredictable, too.The first four episodes were good, but there were several things that bothered me a little. I think the characters' moods changed too quickly and unnatural, because when they were in the ""bedroom"", they seemed pretty happy and acted like everything was good, even though there were hours, or minutes, before playing while their lives are at stake. I also think that when there were just seconds before the games begun. They acted very cocky, and not afraid at all, but suddenly when the games started, they were suddenly terrified. Also, some of the conversations were weak, I think. There were long conversations between the less important characters, but the dialogues weren't the best ones themselves either. It felt like the production were delaying the time by filling the scenes between the games in the first four episodes with weak conversations. I also think Seong Gi-hun should have a longer screen time because he was the main character, and Han Mi-neyo less, because she was quite annoying after some time. However, those episodes were still enjoyable to watch because of the frightening games.There were a lot of violence and gore, which really made the show brutal in a cruel, but a positive way. It generally made the games more frightening, but at the same time, the show wasn't that dark, which could have been the case, so it was easier to deal with the violence. Anyway, the effects were great, and the fighting sequences were also quite appealing. Generally, the action in this show were well made.I was least impressed with the 6th episode, Kkanbu, because of the little boring storyline. The scenes were very long with few exciting moments. I think it could have been done better. The sad moments between the characters were supposed to be sad and devastating, but I didn't get the strong attachment to the characters, which I hoped for. For example, the scenes between Kang Sae-byeok and Ji-yeong were potential, but Ji-yeong as a character felt quite unexplored, so it didn't really touch my feelings when she lost at purpose. I had a feeling that the production's idea was to affect us viewers by making the episode feel long-lasting and devastating, but it didn't really work out for me. The scenes between Seong and Oh Il-nam were good, though, I think. They were intense in their own ways.After the 6th episode, the story became more dynamic, and the excitement reached higher and higher. After the least important characters died, the more important ones also started to lose their lives, which made the show even more unpredictable. What was going to happen next? It was really exciting when the Front Man revealed himself in front of Hwang Jun-ho. Truly tragic. But the last episode - wow! That was my favorite episode, and an incredible end of the season. I think the squid game ended in a good way, but the twist was the best of all. A fantastic idea because we got to know the core of why the games generally existed. I also think the scene, were Seong suddenly spotted the man playing ddakji with the Salesman, was brilliant. It was terrifying.Overall, a show with a unique concept. The gore symbolizes the games' cruelty, and the effects were great. The show was good with some flaws in the first half, but the second half lifted the excitement higher and higher, and ended in an excellent way.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The problem with a mini series that starts out as good as this one is, it's really hard to keep the same intensity for eight more episodes. The first episode is arguably the most intense and shocking 55 minutes ever filmed. So there's bound to be a drop off. Even so, the entire series is extremely watchable and even binge worthy. If you're looking for something different... THIS IS IT !!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn't suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn't written well enough and haven't got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he's on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode ""Gganbu"" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you're okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that's not really any kind of masterpiece.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I want to dedicate this review just for episode 6 which involves a marble game.Episode 6 is the greatest piece of emotional rollercoaster i have ever watched.

"I wanted to give this 9/10, as I enjoyed the first 6 episodes immensely. Ok, it's not massively original in its premise, but the South Korean slant and the focus on individual debt made this more than interestingHowever, once the VIP's arrived I felt it lost its way a little and the switch to English was quite jarring (I watched it in subtitles). Whether it was deliberate or not, the ""acting"" and dialogue of the VIP's was pretty poor and riddled with unnecessary exposition and cliche. In addition, I felt the subplot regarding the stowaway policeman wasn't properly resolvedWhilst the finale wasn't terrible - it felt a little disjointed with some characters making decisions that seemed odd based on what they'd done before (Cho Sang-Woo for example in the Squid game). Also, the ""reveal"" in the skyscraper kind of ruined a few of the previous episodes.It's a shame, as this could have been an even better series than it actually was - but it is still definitely worth a watch.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid Game isn't easy viewing at all; and I believe that it was meant to make viewers uncomfortable and distressing as all hell, because that's what desperation with life-and-death situations are truly like, and it can actually break who we are as people.456 players, 45.6 billion South Korean won, six games, and only ONE player can come out as the grand champion after everyone else has been killed. To make matters even worse these people were kidnapped off the streets because of their debts to collectors, yet outside the world is far more unforgiving than the brutal takes on classic kid's games.Netflix managed to strike gold with this show, which I guess took off because of the pandemic's devastating effects on ALL of society, and the themes of desperation and survival resonated with anyone and everyone who tuned into this breakaway mega-hit. It got people so invested it became a massive meme, where people parodied the thing, cooked up fan-theories and mocking the show's all-English dub.In spite of the showy production values in Squid Game, the characters are still very much like real people who've got real frustrations, real tension inside them, and very real everyone-for-themselves urgency to their character arcs. Squid Game is still a grounded story in spite of its SELECT sci-fi/spy-fi trappings and comic-book-like iconography with the 'PlayStation Men' and mysterious leader.Squid Game is Netflix's unexpected phenomenon; and I reckon there'll be those who understand and appreciate it and those who won't.Memes or no memes, this is a show definitely worth your time.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The show in the beginning was interesting and unpredictable. It gave a glimpse of the desperation the lower class faces to survive in a cruel world. Emotional connections and back stories were established for most of the side characters making some deaths quite emotionally gripping.The biggest issues I have with the show are the twists. Mainly, Il-nam being the host of the show and the front man being the cop's brother. The old man's motivation for making such a gruesome game was because he was rich, bored and didn't see kindness in the world doesn't sit well with a lot of people. It made sense in the first game as he smiles as he walks past people being shot, but his behavior in the rest of the show is incongruent. There are other points to be made on the old man, but now I'll mention the cop's brother being the front man twist. It was shown that the brother was a previous winner of the game, but to leave a massive plot hole as to why he did this is insane. After shooting the cop and being briefly haunted by his decision is all we get from that. I personally found that cheap and lazy to bring shock to the viewers. Also, there is no excuse for the VIP's to have such horrendous acting. They can act all high and mighty, but the delivery was hard to watchDespite the interesting foreshadowing that hinted as to what will happen to the side characters in the future, it can't be helped that it was all marred by inconsistent writing and plot armor. An enjoyable show, but not an 8 by any means.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked and enjoyed ""Squid Game"" (2021) series for its interesting and simple concept which at the end of the day was very solidly executed. Acting was very solid, as well as directing and writing. The whole concept felt fresh and kinda original and it was easy to get attached and watch the whole show. Ending was also pretty interesting, although a bit predictable.Overall, i enjoyed ""Squid Game"". It felt fresh and was involving as well being believable throughout. I believe that given its popularity it will get more seasons. As long as they will be solid as the first one, I'm in for this show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Really cared about these characters. It really made me attached to this movie. Great storytelling!,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It has great suspenful moment and with decent to good character development. Due to this, a lot of the character death are painful to watch. It's definitely reccomended for those who love thriller. Plotwise, I would say it's decent enough to keep u watching and drive the story forward.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I have just finished it watching and I have no words to describe it. Trust me when I say this , It is probably the best thing I have ever seen. Story, acting , casting , production everything is very apt and top notch. I can't believe how perfect of a show is this. It is extreme in every human nature they portrayed like when they want to show you hate , friendship, trust , action, backstabbing every emotion is of very extreme kind. It also teaches us that money is not everything. Those who have money and those who don't are sad in one way or the other & We should help others no matter what. I will give it 10 out 10. All hail to Korea for this treat. Love from India ?눒?눛",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

It's an entertaining and visually appealing drama for sure, but goes downhill after a few episodes. Kinda reminds me of the original ""Purge"" movie.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The show is pretty decent upto prefinal episodes but messed up later. All that police guy investigation is just show that front man is his brother ? And main lead has most turboulous mind ever (eg: want to kill his friend in prefinal episode and want to save the same friend in final episode). I honestly think this show is overrated and it deserves 7/10.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I saw it with English dubbing, but I don't think I connected with it at all. The build-up to the tale is fantastic, and it's always fun to watch a suspense game series. I liked it, but I wasn't as impressed with the finish as I was with the beginning.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again...",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"So hard to stop watching this crazy stupid show. Got to give it to the writers, it was so addictively captivating.Set design was so good you'll be seeing every halloween costume this year look the same.Episode 6 was by the far the peak of this series, an unbelievable conclusion to the previous 5 episodes. After that however, I can't say much... seemed to drift from the theme of fairness and equity among players which I really liked.Definitely recommend this series. Even though some of the mysteries that were trying to be sneaky were quite apparent early on, it didn't take away from the excitement and stakes of the game.(And something that I knew bothered many people was the atrocious acting by the American characters. Not sure if the problem was poor casting choices or some kind of language barrier, but damn, I can safely say for everyone- that part was hard to watch)",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

3. Multiple wasted side stories / appearances.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Mixed feelings on this one. The glorification of violence in shows like this tend to be desensitizing and seem to acclimate those with criminal tendencies to head down a wrong path. Yet the challenge of the individual games create a paradox of situations in which the viewer is steered toward thinking that certain players will work together, only to find they are pitted against each other, as in the marble game. The horror of that game was brought forth when a married couple naively decided to work together, only to be faced with the grim reality that there could only be one survivor. These kinds of situations were prevalent throughout the series episodes, making it almost impossible to know who would survive at the final outcome. Through it all, I believed there was something noteworthy about the old man, player #1 (Hideo Kimura), who's physical resemblance to an aged Korean Billy Crystal impinged on my brain every time I saw him (go back and see what I mean). Oddly, for such a large cast of characters, there weren't any that I could really connect with in a meaningful way. Perhaps the closest was player #240, young Ji-yeong (Vivian Lu, incorrectly identified in the credits as Sae-Byeok), eliminated in play when partnered with player #67 Kang Sae-byeok (Jung Hoyeon). Tied for most despicable characters were player #101 Deok-su (Paul Nakauchi) and player #212 Han Mi-neo (Stephanie Komure), so it was appropriate that they should be eliminated together in the Glass Stepping Stones game. The ending here seemed a little superfluous considering all that went before, with the old man Il-nam wagering a final personal bet against Gi-hun (Greg Chun), player #456, and winner of the grand prize of 45.6 billion won. Doing the conversion, that came to just under thirty nine million dollars, and seeing all those big numbers can really disorient the viewer. When Gi-hun paid the flower vendor at the end of the story a ten thousand won note for a single bunch, it seemed awful generous, until doing the math revealed it was about eight dollars and fifty cents.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I wasn't experting a lot from this series, because movies/series that are this hyped are not usually the best. But this was great!! First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP's (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won't go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.PS: sorry for the bad english, I'm dutch so you know.....",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I bought into the hype and watched this mess. I am very confused about what people see in it. I can look past the horrible over acting by the VO artists, stale premise and cheap production but the story drags with zero development. I stuck it out until the end and was completely let down. By far, the worst finale of any series in history.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"All these caucasians complaining about the VIPs about their accent or their oddly scripted lines are hilarious to me. I mean hollywood has been doing this to asians for decades, guess everyone feels weird now that it is happening in reverse. For example, Hiring different asian person to play a specific role about a specific asian nationality, hiring white ppl to play asian characters. Not even really learning the correct language or bother to learn the correct pronunciations of their lines. Or even write them a proper line in their own language in a show or a movie. Or forcing asian actors to have an asian accent when the said actor does not actually have one. I guess decades of watching random ppl portraying asians in some gibberish accent has always made me cringe. Now everyone gets to experience it as well hahaha.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Music was a bit annoying at times but it gave a lot of it tension that was really needed in all of the ""games"". The ending is incredible and I don't think there should be a season 2. I would love to see more tho. I feel like they didn't really think the show itself is going to get really popular so they ended it right there.9/10 only thing that was bad were the VIPs. Would love to see more with the VIP plot etc.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The movie started with great plots and provided great anticipation for viewer like me. It keeps your mind thinking what's the game coming next.However everything went south when the VIP appeared.. the movie added some low b-graded westerners with psycho minded which I don't see the connection at all. When they were ushered to the room with naked body paintings, the scenes were so disconnected.Apart from the above, this is a great movie.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I'll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much ""micromanagement"" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the ""micromanagement"" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Many reviewers have commented on the ""horrible acting"" of the VIPs. I sense their lack of emotion is intentional. It is indicative of their lack of normal human empathy.Overall I found the story to be interesting and that the story compelled me to continue watching through to the end. In that regard, the production was well done.The conclusion and theme is not anything that I can praise however. Life is not purposeless nor is everyone bad and lacking in virtue. I have viewed so many Asian films that purport to say ""life is futile"".Life is worth living. Life has meaning. That is my hope and faith. So I stand against the theme of the production but I found it interesting and entertaining. Entertainment is its only value.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Too many bloody, violences, cruelties, and inappropriate scenes. I suggest that it could be made softer and a bit more elegant, then it could be more interested to watch it.

"5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The sets were good, the characters were good especially the lead and the english dubbing wasn't too bad! The TV Show is gory & dark in a lot of areas & reminds me of the Hunger Games crossed with Saw!The only things that I found were off were the filler parts of the Show, the talking parts, the drawn out scenes all seemed to drag quite a bit, ok character development is a must, but cutting it down & getting to the point is also a must not to mention consistancy!Overall, it's a good Show with a creative premise and good story to follow!

"Squid game is a well-crafted show engineered to appeal to western audience. All the tropes of a running series are found here. The royalty-free music placed near the end of the episode to make you reflect, the constant cliff hangers (which are archaic in the age of binge watching), and the excessive - and I mean EXCESSIVE - investment in character backstory and development. This last trope is particularly obnoxious.At least five episodes are dedicated to the development of characters or establishing their backstory. The growth of the characters are so slow, repetitive and saturating that it makes it hard to become invested in them. It is ironic that you feel more for the lesser characters than for the primary characters.Another point of contention are the games and where they take place. There is such a thing as inspiration, but there is also such a thing as theft. This show borrows inspiration from previous Battle Royale style works (see As the Gods Will it and Alice in Borderland). However, what it borrows in inspiration from one work, it blatantly steals from another. Those who have watched Battle Royale would be able to tell just how blatantly lifted one of its unique concepts is during one pivotal scene in the series. This is not excusable.What is also inexcusable are the actors who portrayed the VIPs. Calling the acting atrocious is a compliment. Their acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like an Oscar contender.The lukewarm observations of ethics, morality and the human condition would appeal to teenagers or forum philosophers, but to the seasoned viewers who have either watched Korean cinema or Battle Royale movies it is as run of the mill as it gets.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Focused on classical music while acts of a nameless barbarism take place before our eyes... To watch in original version even if we do not understand anything in Korean so as not to miss the great actingThe ending foreshadows a season 2 while being relatively surprising as to the identity of the creator of the game. A few small questions remain, but nothing important enough to be disturbing.A great discovery that I recommend without hesitation if the big spurts of blood don't bother you too much.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Seriously?8.3?The ending is absolutely illogical.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's disturbing but all the more entertaining for it. I rarely watch series with a plot, let alone that fast (took me less than 4 days, which is super unusual for me). Read some reviews saying there was no character development but I will have to disagree. All major character change from ep 1 to their last respective scene. Some scenes were very emotional as well, ep 6 had me sobbing. The acting by the VIP's was a bit off-putting but ultimately didn't bother me as much. I loved the games too, being of Korean descent. Only the 5th game was somewhat out of order and dragged a bit. The additional storylines around the games made it even more real, somehow. There are some open ends which have me looking forward to the 2nd season.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"With all the hype around it I was very interested in this series, but found myself somewhat disappointed. Yes, it is interesting enough to keep watching, but actually it is not that special. Yes there are some interesting plot twists but again, not really shocking. It is all a basic conflict of bonding with people that all go for the money, where apparently our hero is the only one with some moral feelings. The storyline with the detective did not add much and the VIPs were silly. The gangster is very stereotype and silly.There is a uprising in Korean series, this one is ok, but not special. ""Memories of the Alhambra"" and ""Sysiphus"" are much more intelligent in their script.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
TBH THIS IS THE BEST KDRAMA IV WATCHED IN 2021. THE IDEA IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL KDRAMAS. IT SHOWED US THAT THERE ARE MANY GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KILL AND BETRAY YOU FOR MONEY AND IT SHOWED HOW FRIENDS CAN SCARIFIES FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT. I RLY LIKED IT AND I HOPE THERE IS SEASON 2 WHERE THE REVENGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The acting is terrible, the English translation deserves jail time. Choosing Ho Yeon Yung to star was brilliant because even if she can't act her face is enigmatic despite not having a single emotion on her face.

It is just another example of stupidification of the masses willing to eat what is shoveled out.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Amazing cinematography, great idea, but I think it should've been a movie or a 5-episode mini-series. Definitely overhyped and overrated, at this moment it scores 8.2, same level as Money Heist which is clearly a much better show.It could be that English dubbing makes it less entertaining, but I also think that after the first 3-4 games writers have ran out of ideas.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I guess I was a bit confused due to the last episode but to dig deep down inside the main character, he has a really warm heart from the moment that he fed a cat to the moment that he stop the game for his friend, so I guess it has never been easy for him to use that money immidiately. And after seeing the death of 455 players, it is understandable why he didn't choose to break his daughter's new family in LA (which can be considered as paradise) but come back to Hell Joseon as a new human-being (when ppl change their hair color, it means that they want to be a new them) to maybe get revenge for his friend or change the whole system of the game ^^?

"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

That's what clicked and made me give it 10/10.In such a short span of time, you get an emotional connection to the characters despite not even speaking the same language.

"I feel like this is one of those shows that went viral and it's not entirely clear why. The show is good, but nothing so exceptional that it deserves this kind of attention. In my opinion the actors, sound and cinematography are all great and I enjoyed their delivery.The writing on the other hand, is a pretty mixed bag. For example, the show's only subplot (that gets may 20-30% of screentime) has no impact on the main plot and then later resolves itself with a really underwhelming twist. Why did they even bother including it? In general, there are too many senseless twists towards the end that lessen the characters and series.Then there's the rather clich챕 ""rich people pitting poor people against each other"" setting. They make the rich villains so cartoonishly evil, that I can't take them seriously. Especially their ""69"" jokes sound like they were written by a 12-year old on 9GAG.My gripes with the writing aside, I think it was still an interesting watch. There are also some really obvious hints that the show is looking to make a sequel, so maybe the creators can write something more nuanced then.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
My first review... you will not regret watching this as fans of both thrillers and korean dramas... this film really has outdone itself.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I have to say after watching the trailer, I immediately saved this series to my watch list and could not wait until it is out.However, maybe due to my high expectation I was quite disappointed after finishing the 1st season on one run. Believe me, I'm a sucker for this kind of genre so I'm looking for interesting plot, great games and unpredictable twists. If you're the same as me, the series will not deliver these. I found some parts are redundant with unnecessary overacting, I had to skip plenty times. The plot is quite boring for me compared to other survival-game series. But, I cannot deny the cinematography is great.If you have some time to kill, it still brings you some entertainment. Keep your expectation lower to enjoy it more if possible.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Ep1 wonderful drama that we love, protagonist of dubious character, we didn't even root for him, but I loved his rambunctious behavior, Chips 1, 2, 3, bizarre in the way we love... T2 more drama than blood, we love it too... Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains...
Ep 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely..
Ep 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...
I finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this...",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's a good series. Is it as good as Alice in Borderland, not really, this one, while having more realistic qualities, is basically that series meets Parasite with a light flavoring of Saw series. Outside of the main character there isn't much in the way of an engaging cast. In fact towards the end of the series you're rooting against most of them. The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It's really just not that clever, despite the hype. It is a good series, and of course being a K series social and economic injustice is deeply threaded into the theme. Like I said though, it's enjoyable, worth the watch but not as thoughtful as it tries so hard to be.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"""You don't trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on""Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'. Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The plot is similar to SAW and LOST. But,the Korean makers have given enough depth to the characters in this web series, that you feel for the characters even though it is predictable. There are enough shock value moments that keeps you hooked. Worth binge watching!!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride.

Do not watch this while eating. Actually do not watch this at all. It's pointless.Edit : Having been sick with fever and stuck to bed I managed to watch through the whole series. (I guess this was the only way to go through the episodes) Having done so I'll have to change my original 1-star rating to 8-star because some significant points were made later in the series, concerning human nature, which were thought provoking and I actually found interesting. Still believe that it is gross though and not suitable for the faint hearted or those that can't bear the sight of blood or actually any kind of sensitive and/or sensible person. They will feel disgusted. But conclusively I don't regret watching it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I enjoyed the show up until the ending, I knew the premise of it before beginning it, its a hunger games and survival show. I wanted to know the why of it, it's the reason I decided to watch. I found it a bit violent, but it had great visuals, very colorful and actors where not bad either, I actually empathized with main characters and enjoyed the side stories. However, the ending was terrible, I was expecting much much more, on the investigative side the detective does very little and I was dissapointed that he actually gets killed without mercy and further by the front man, who is his brother, and his side of the story is never told. I agree that would make a good second season material, however, the last scenes where the old man reveals he created the game with his buddies for entertainement purposes, and to relieve boredom with no further purpose, is killing all the mystery and there would absolutely be nothing new for the second season in terms of mystery, just need for revenge. The old man, instead of using his money to do good, he created and apparently participated in children's games, where he bets with his rich buddies and kills the poor men and women who are indebted and obviously need help. Rich people killing poor people just for entertainment, I find it disgusting and without substance. Overrated show and terrible ending. That ending spoiled the second season for me.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The main idea and story is quite deep and difficult to understand and that's why I think that a lot of people don't understand what is the main point of the story, a lot of people just like colours, blood, death and weird characters.

A woman who uses people is 24/7 this way
And if there's a game that's based on people fighting to keep the bet on,why would they let them kill each other?And the whole brother murder thing is really dumb..and somr plots are dumb like a couple coming back again and being surprised they'll kill each other while it's supposed to happen at one point or the other,and people repeating that they'll get out together while the rule was you can't get out together and keep the money...and the VIPs arc was waaayyyy too dumb.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Also a recent Japanese series (Alice in borderland) has almost the exact same idea.2) totally predictable even for a six years old.3) Overdramatic without any reason using of course too much of the respective music.4) The acting was almost ridiculous and almost making you laugh instead of feeling what the creator thought you should feel.AND PEOPLE for god sake don't fall for marketing tricks, promotions and trendy stuff.There are so many more (countless) shows and series way much better than this that deserve your time.

The viewer doesn't want to see this guy anymore...After this, nearly all interactions are based on the villain being the hero, and the previous main story guy is treated like a lucky whimp, even though he is decisive and moral.

The main character is this completely unremarkable John battered by life that only occasionally yells angrily at the world. All of it is just one huge waste.

I just imagined this type of game in my mind only but never thought it will become real in series. And this series plays so much with our feelings for example - we want both players alive but one has to die and it hurts so much.

What in the name of Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers was going on with their horrendous, cold, bleak acting?Aside from that, I appreciate how realistic and simple the plot is, but it is so well-developed.

"The show got popular thanks to the strength of the first few episodes but the story, acting and plot all take a nosedive as the series progresses.The show is excessively gory to fill in for it's lack of actual substance and there isn't a satisfying ending for any of the characters.Very average show but that's generally what you can expect from gore porn television/movies/etc.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"!!! UNPOPULAR OPINION !!! - no spoilersLike many things nowadays, this show was hyped to hell. Any objective opinion doesn't matter any more. If 짬 they 쨩 tell you it's amazing, then you're going to 짬 think 쨩 it's amazing. It's not.Squid Game is far from ""amazing"".The show actually starts really well, with an interesting approach to anti capitalism, and a strong visual language. But there are just so many writing inconsistencies that it's impossible to take it seriously, and it pulled me out of the experience. There are countless situations where things feel unnatural, forced, specially near the ending. Other things just don't make sense, like the main character's choice at the end. The last episodes feel unfinished, unpolished, and underwhelming.And the ending...omg. Botched to hell. The final twist is so idiotic, so so lazy... 짬 Let's make a shocking twist ! 쨩 - the writers must've thought... Boring.However, Squid Game was still fun to watch, with strong moments here and there. But is it up the hype ? Absolutely not.Ultimately, the show tries too hard to be special, and in doing so, it fails to be coherent.It's basically Westworld, but much worse, and for teenagers.Sorry...",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Great acting, heart and soul, lots of action and hard decision making. A tad slow at first, but after ep 2, I couldn't look away. At times I wanted to but I just couldn't. Definitely recommend.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Never mind about the VIPs bad acting comments. They play such a secondary role and they have few seconds in a couple of episodes. Yes, they suck, but it doesn't have any influence on how good the show is.It's an amazing show that is way more than that. Outstanding performances from korean actors, great storytelling, and korean approach at its best: drama, thriller and comedy all in the same box.Have fun!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Main character is completely unlikeable by the end of the story. Other than that the show is awesome with the games and side characters.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, ""handsome"", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game Ojing-eo Geimis a South Korean survival drama television series on Netflix created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, who wrote and directed all nine episodes. Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, Jung Ho-yeon, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi, and Kim Joo-ryoung. The series revolves around a contest where 456 players in deep financial debt put their lives at risk to play a series of children's games for the chance to win a 45.6 billion a prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang had conceived of the idea based on his own economic struggles early in life as well as the class disparity in South Korea. Though he had initially written it in 2009, he was unable to find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of their drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I think any review and ratings for movies is reflective of the theme of this series itself. Is this series worth 10? Clearly no. But many will give it 10 for 2 reasons.1) Gore addicts. 2) Go with the hype.In a clear objective analysis. This series started out extremely good, original, and with very deeply moving and captivating backstories. However by about mid point, like many other series, they ran out of ideas and became cliche, just another Hunger Game, Saw, etc... remake.That being said, for the first part at least, I would give it a 10. The 2nd 1/2, is clearly a 5 and a balance of 7 to 7.5. Rounding down because of certain plot holes and inconsistencies which I will address here.1) Most of the game staff's reactions through the series were puzzling and inaccurate. Everyone signed a contract and death waiver, so technically speaking, everything they were doing was legal. So why were they afraid of the police? Why overly secret? The scene when the front man realized a police was in his office, he pulled out a gun to hunt him. Why? They technically did nothing wrong. If anything, pulling out a gun to threaten the police made them wrong.This was clearly demonstrated in episode 2 that they even allowed the players to vote out of playing. They had no fear of any legal repercussion, yet then why rest of the series they were so worried about it? It is an error in their fundamental logic of the script.2) A lot of Koreans preached about how this is a series addressing income inequality in South Korea, maybe the whole capitalist world. Yet, in the film, every single player was there for a reason and not because they were victims. The main protagonist himself gambled away his money, despite having bad luck in the employment. He may not have a luxurious life, but his massive debt came from gambling and borrowing money from loan sharks.His best friend was even worse, a white collar criminal that embezzled from his clients, created fraudulent documents, etc... from ""bad investments."" Cough cough, you mean pyramid schemes? From his character throughout the series, he was not a moral man, and revealed to be a psychopath. So he was there despite the fact he was not from the lower part of the wealth range.3) The night time massacre scene was either one of the most brilliant writing in this series or the worst, depending on whether it was intentional by the writers. What am I talking about?Either the writers blundered and just wrote in this cliche plot line of how people will turn on each other for money, to survive, and what not. Or ... it was deliberate to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the game system.Throughout the game, the gamer staff dictated an ""equal"" environment of 2nd chance, not only so, but one heavily and meticulously kept accountable. When they found out 1 player was cheating with the staff, they were eliminated and made examples of. Not only so, they observed their 3 fundamental rules so tightly, they even allowed them to vote out the game in episode 2.So the riot scene was out of place, either as a writers' blunder again in the inconsistency of the script, or it was brilliantly put in to demonstrate the hypocrisy of their so called game. They claim to have strict equal rules, even a democratic process, but in the end, used monetary incentive, greed, and starvation to thin the herd when necessary and to turn the players against each other rather than against the game staff. Players were suppose to play the games and be eliminated through the games, not murdered in their sleep. There was no accountability when that 1st man was murdered and as such created hostile environment rather than the promise of fair play.All of the sudden, the chance to vote out as a majority disappeared as the players were no longer divided into 2 groups, yes and no, but into multiple self-interested groups. This is... the heart of socialism, which might all along be the author's intent.If it is... it is brilliantly done. Why?Take a step back and look at all 9 episodes. This is what it means then.In the capitalist world, there are winners and losers, there is a wealth gap. What socialism does, is preach to those who failed in the capitalist world, by their own hands, and a promise of a ""2nd chance,"" a better system, under the pretense of equality, a democratic process, accountability, and social order.However, in reality, all of this was done at gun point and the people, though voluntarily there, were there without choice because their alternative is go back to their failed life in the capitalist system. The socialist system itself is a deception, instead of order, they actually created chaos and pits people against people through greed, starvation, and manipulation. The people, which originally had a choice to democratically end it, then becomes enemies towards each other, losing sight of the real enemy that put them there in the first place. In the end, even if you win in a socialist system, like the protagonist, you really lose. The only real winners? Are the socialist creators.This is socialism's core, what happened in many countries throughout history such as North Korea, China, Venezuela, and what is happening now in many western worlds, including the USA.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This k-horror is a must see. Lots of blood and death this tale is not for those with weak stomachs. But this tale delivers more than just shock value. It's a commentary on high stakes gambling where there is no risk greater than death. Children's games harken innocence while greed and sacrifice decide each players fate. The ""VIP's"" are the weakest link, depicted as caricatures of selfish rapacious greed; but even with their one dimensionality there is a lot of social commentary to consider.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Do yourself a big favor and listen to the Korean audio with subtitles. The voice over dialog does t do the show any justice. Very enjoyable. Has a Parasite meet Maze Runner type of feel.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I absolutely love this show, the story is great, character development, and basically everything keeps you interested in it. I'd say the first 2 episodes aren't as good as the following 7, but that's part of the good stuff. There are many plot twists that blew my mind, and I will defo watch it again <3Something that really made me ""cringe"" were the VIP's. Their scripts didn't feel natural enough and this is something that happens in almost every K-Drama or any Korean movie; they try and force Americans/foreigners in the movie and their scripting is just not good.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The concept and idea of the game is pretty cool, but there are too many holes in the plot to be able to enjoy it as much as I should.Why did the old man vote to end it after the first game, when he was behind it all?Where did all the prize money and money to keep staff and facilities etc come from? Did the VIP's really sponsor with this amount of cash?Who are these people working there accepting all of this?How can these competitions have lasted for over a decade without any of them getting the story out?How could the organ harvester do this, with the trap doors in special furnaces etc. Without it being known by the front man?The idea of deathly competitions with child games are quite thought out and brilliant, except that there are games that really are not child games.However when trying to create the reason and background for all of it, it just feels flat and like a quick fix.The VIP's acting/script is just as horrible and flat as the story behind it all.I can still recommend people to watch it though!It still is quite exciting at times and the relationships are pretty well thought out!",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Criticize the VIPs all you want, but don't ding the show for the VIP's bad acting, poor scripts, and being terribly out of place altogether. I believe all of that is intentional. We, as viewers of the show, are just like the VIPs. We are paying for our Netflix subscriptions to fund the show's production, and watching this ""game"" fold out for our entertainment. It's no wonder these VIPs purposefully speak English.If you're disgusted by the VIPs (and hopefully most of us are), then you should be disgusted by ourselves and our roles in society.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This felt like yet another Korean remake of a popular Japanese TV show and/or movie (which itself was originally a manga) -- The movie in question is, ""As The Gods Will"" which came out in Japan back in 2014. Sure, they changed just enough so as to avoid any messy legal IP/copyright issues, but let's not pretend this movie is an original idea.I personally don't mind remakes, especially with foreign films being localized for a different audience (& culture). I just don't like it when try to pass off the remake as their original idea.As far as the show itself goes, it wasn't bad. I rather liked it, and liked the fact it was a TV show instead of a movie -- with a TV show you get more time to explore the world & characters. Acting was OK, cinematography was excellent and the writing wasn't bad either. I'd definitely recommend this movie to friends.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This movie is sooooo overrated, it's a blatant plagiarism from Japanese movies like ""As the Gods will"", ""Liar Game"", ""Friend Game"", and the final twist is a piece of a popular series name Saw.The director of the film even stated that As The Gods Will was created in the 2010s, after his initial idea for Squid Game, but if he had to say it, he would say he did it first.Seriously? He make a movie that has a lot of stuff copied from movies that came out years ago and say he made it first by his idea?!? You think audiences are stupid?You create something after someone else, you have to make it different otherwise you are just a copycat of other people's work and effort. You can't just copied and say ""I made it first because I had the idea in mind first."" It's ridiculous!Stealing other people's work and make it your own it's dirty and unacceptable in the modern world, a really talented, self-respecting director would definitely never do that.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I'm kind of blown away by this masterpiece. It does has it's flaws, mainly in the dubbing / subtitle area, but that's pretty common with asian movies. I guess it's next to impossible to do this 100% right. The series has awesome characters, not a single weak filler episode and many wtf moments. It's a fresh breeze in the world of Netflix' teenie action series that are basically unwatchable as soon as you are older than 25.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Not often do I watch foreign films but sometimes there is a jem. This is one for sure. .Do yourself a favor dont dub it in with your language, hear and feel the real actor, his or her voice and emotions. The subtitles will come easily after the first 15 mins.. . I found the acting great..just ignore the VIPS part lol..that passes fairly quickly anyway..otherwise some you may become fond of, it causes emotions to rise and fall, there is mystery, suspense, some comedy, but mostly it holds you on the edge to what will be next. Who is who..and so forth. I enjoyed so much I went on the hunt for another Korean show..im now enjoying (not as good as Squid in my eyes)Sweet Home. Highly recommend Squid.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I really like Squid Game. Terrific acting, visually amazing, and fully engaging with a pure-hearted main character walking through hell. Also, the directing was outstanding. I hope there will be another season.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"They just suck. Everything about them is just bad, they were build up to be so cool but so disappointed.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Some spoilers here, and this review is before season 2 comes out, but this show was a solid 7/10 for me. There was plenty to love, as you could really get invested in some of the characters which are all very realistic in their own way. This show is aesthetically pleasing, with great directing and acting. Interesting plot that mostly delivers on the setup. Finally, the score really works well with this show and the tone is very consistent throughout.For me though, I couldn't go higher than a 7 because of the, in my opinion, weak twists that happened and the lack of explanation given to some aspects of the story. The final twist was unknowingly foreshadowed with small hints, but the choice of the twist with what we were shown feels kind of forced and pointless to me. The frontman twist went nowhere, leaving you with more questions than answers, and really not much care for that character. Finally, the show has a bit of a slow start that completely focuses on Gi-Hun, which really took away the tension of who will live and die because I'm just thinking ""this is our main character and there's only one winner"" the whole time. These things took away from my enjoyment of the show, but overall it is still great and I can see why so many people are loving it- I will be trying out season 2 when it arrives although I am slightly skeptical of where they can go from here if they focus on Gi-Hun.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I've seen my fair share of survival genre shows and games, so I wasn't overly interested in watching this series, but since so many of my friends had seen it, I figured I'd give it a try. To my surprise, the first few episodes were quite compelling and the characters felt more 'human' and less two-dimensional than many other shows/movies/games I've seen in this genre.I think I was thoroughly enjoying this series up until I finished episode 6. Ep 6 was great, and emotional, but episode 7 onwards were just awful for me. Episode 7 in particular might've been the worst one. The challenge could hardly be called a 'game', and the VIP characters were unbelievably painful. I couldn't understand how the dialogue was so bad. The cuts to them and their cliche (and repetitive) dialogue made me lose that feeling of immersion I had with the other episodes. Episode 8 didn't feel like it really achieved anything, and episode 9... well, the 'twist' was quite unsatisfying. It didn't feel very believable, and there wasn't any closure with regard to the policeman and what he had attempted to send to the police when he got to the beach in the previous episode. It really just felt like there were some weird loose ends.So, I would give this show even a generous 10 stars for the first 6 eps, but I really was so disappointed by the subsequent three that I can only give it 7 stars.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

We simply don't. No need to lie.So if you think this is a distopia,it's not.

Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.This series expresses an aspect of Korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless stateA recent Korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soAsk yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn't there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don't people should know that elimination means being killed? It's only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played.

"Gaming with human lives has been a subject in movies since The Most Dangerous; or even before; any movie about Gladiators was basically about people risking their lives to entertain the public.However, after the worldwide success of PARASITE the subject of social struggle has become preponderant also on the Korean movies.Many from that country like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance or Old Boy had lots of references about the social fight ; poor people trying to survive, rich people abusing them; but recently has become the full theme; thus this series.Contrary to expectations; the gore and violence level in the series is not that high; but the drama is.The first 7 chapters is about the people's misery around and why they accept to bet their lives for money. The characters lives are depressing desperate losers and (with one exception) selfish and far from sympathetic; all of them seem to be guilty of their own tragedies.Hundred of people are killed but most of them are unknown or have no empathy. We only get to know only a few of the characters; which will eventually mostly die.The games are not spectacular but the suspense is well crafted.The first problem is that the series is in itself too slow (for my own taste); a faster pace and at least two hours less could make it a lot better.The oppressing classes appears by the final chapters but is more really a caricature than real people. Too cliched for its own good.The second big problem is the resolution. In may ways contradicts all the previous ideas. Perhaps preparing people for a follow up.In brief; it requires a lot of patience the the depiction of the human condition and the consequences of bad choices make it worth a view (if you and your family can bear the killings).",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"After reading and seeing stories like Liar Game, Kaiji and multiple Battle Royale clones over 20 years ago this one doesn't bring anything new to the table. Not only isn't it the first, but Squid Game isn't even among the best of its kind.To be fair my main critique isn't the old concept. A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun's decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it's clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There's really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn't make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out. Definitely one of the best things about this show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The show made me cringe on so many levels and so many times. I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This show is really good. A 'BIT' like a Korean 'Hunger Games'. The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you'll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character's voices are so comically bad that it's pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should've been either played by someone else, or the part should've been written out.

"A battle royale-style concept that's been done many times in different forms (e.g., Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc.), but there's just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again. The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end. Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end. But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion.Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don't think they should--it doesn't really need it, nor leaves you wanting more.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This series gets a 6 overall...For the concept and cinematography, this deserves a 7... Well filmed and good use of lighting and colours... The costume was vibrant and eye catching but rather bland after a couple of episodes... Some parts felt disjointed and out of place...The script in terms of story and logic gets a 6... Some illogical occurrences and lapses in a supposedly tightly controlled environment... Some characters seem to overreact all the time while some felt detached and unaffected...""normal"" people seldom react similarly under duress but a few characters do not seem involved...a few act overly cool towards ""friends"" and a few overly warm towards ""adversaries""...
Perhaps there were too many characters to properly develop but even the main ones aren't 'likeable' enough to root for... And most of the plot became predictable before the half way mark..The acting was the major let down for me and scored between a 4 and a 5.... While there were some great moments yet generally throughout, acting weren't believable... Fear and anger felt under whelming, aggression and obnoxious behaviours seemed overplayed... And some characters over act to clownish proportions...a few of the characters also don't feel consistent, suddenly brave then turn cowardly or vice versa...I found most of the characters unrelatable at many points of the story development... This is partly the fault of the script but the acting or over-acting didn't help...Can't say much more without giving spoilers away... Overall, quite enjoyable but not one where I felt the need to keep chasing the next installment... Continue watching was to just check if my prediction is somewhat accurate instead of a need to find out what happens next... This point is where I feel the series is a let down...Combining the above assessment, an average score of 5.5 to 6 seems fair... Wish they paid more attention to the details... Game of thrones this isn't, well maybe just a below par season 8 of GOT... ""Could have been much better"" is the general feeling...",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The acting is absolutely atrocious throughout with the possible exception of the female lead who's a South Korean model turned actress and one or two others. The main female antagonist is one of the worst actors I've ever seen...ever, she overacts to the point that I was waiting for her head to explode and I cheered when she finally bought it so I wouldn't be subjected to any more of her ""acting"". And even allowing for the dubbing the dialogue is often worse than the acting, corny, cheesy, very dated. And I found the main character to be too much of a loser, to the point that while I knew I was supposed to, I felt no sympathy for him at all. Because all of his problems were completely self-inflicted and he continued to be a loser through the entire series...I just didn't care about him.There are plot holes wide enough to drive a truck through. Like the police detective who manages to infiltrate the island and fool everyone even though there's security everywhere and the guards are computer coded. And lets not even mention how he was able to follow the van from about 30 yards back and then move around on the ferry without anyone seeing him....and I guess I missed the reasoning behind the Front Man being his brother and killing him....And yet.... I couldn't stop watching it....because the writing is incredible, especially compared to the absolute drek coming out of Hollywood these days. And while the acting leaves something to be desired the characters are refreshingly realistic in the way they react to what's happening around them. There are no heroics, no women who can kick the ass of a guy twice their size, no men who end up figuring a way out of the mess they're in. There are just real people dealing with a horrific situation the way actual real live people would, not the way what passes for real people in Hollywood do. The emotions are raw, the situations are brutal and the good guys don't always win because at the end of the day there aren't any good guys...just people trying to survive but not giving a thought to what it's costing them to do it. Episode six was the absolute high point of the series, it felt like a gut punch while I was watching it, how often can you say that about a mainstream series or movie these days? That episode was some of the best drama, some of the best writing I've seen in many years and I think it will stay with me for some time.Sorry to say that they couldn't really maintain it after that. The resolution of the cops story line was lame and I'm not even sure why he was there at all. I'm sure there's something I missed about why his brother, the Front Man, killed him but.... I missed it. The rich spectators were lame; basically tired clich챕's.And the end just kind of fizzled. I know a lot of people think the main character evolved during the games and came out a different person but I have to disagree. He was a loser at the beginning and still one at the end. The old man had a very good point in the final episode, every player was there by choice, they all left and, already knowing what it entailed, made the decision to return. Yet the main character seems to want to blame everyone else for his trauma, the old man, the people running the game, everyone except himself because nothing is ever his fault. He hasn't changed, he makes a half-assed attempt to do right by his promise to the female player by getting her brother and dropping him off with his friends mother but he apparently abandon's the girls mother in the north and in the end fails his own daughter...yet again because he'd rather wallow in guilt and his own self-inflicted misery that try to move on. He's still a loser....just a rich one.Squid Game is yet another version of a very old and well worn story, the difference is that it made the characters into real people who dealt with what was happening around them the way real people would. That's what makes it better than other versions of the same story. And it makes it light years better than any of the drek being churned out by Hollywood these days. Even with it's flaws I highly recommend it. Just be prepared to be emotionally beaten up by it!",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The Old Man being the main guy - hmm...
There are hints throughout the show btw. In the Green Light, Red Light he was the one who just triumphantly walked among the people trembling with fear after the ""K-Anabelle(lol)"" doll starts shooting.He smiles as he is enjoying the moment. But they wouldn't kill him because as we saw he wouldn't be killed after the Marbles Game, he still lives.So, maybe there was no stake for him, I guess or maybe there was... that's why he volunteered to play. Or maybe just for fun of it, you know - as he says.Even in marbles episode, he is shown as a planner to trick 456 just to see if he tries to use the 'dementia' of an 'helpless' old man, even if he is considered a good friend. But he went out as a kind, loving grandpa kind of way. That's why the twist - that he was the Mastermind bums most people. But he is a planner, a great one. I am not judging if he is a smart guy, should be an evil one. Just saying after the series shows he was.Just take this as a fun read, I guess. Umm, bye.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"To begin I need to say the show is lower mediocre.Actors performances are patheticly boring as if they were trying to convince themselves that their acting is right. They did not convince me at all. Especialy the main characters seem like hobby actors to me.Plot is so flawed that by the episode 5 is does not come together already and plus is so predictable that you can guess whats coming pretty much all the time if you use your brain a bit.The whole idea and mesaage of the show (the indebted society we live in) is not groundbreaking either for it has been depicted in far better titles than this one.My personal opinion is that netflix had to hype up some of their show already because of the poor production they have had in past 2 years and so they finaly decided to heavily market one of their shows and they did bet on this one because its different from anything else most people seen. Mainly because of the fact that it is not american neither european culture you are getting from this one.In fact you can not relate to the characters at all until episode 5-6 for the korean culture is so different from what we europeans and americans probably too (even though americans and their culture are pretty demented so you can never really tell) can relate to.To conclude as I already indicated above the only catchy thing about this title is how different it os from what we are used to ""consume"". Like a breath of fresh air that you realize after a minute or two is not really that fresh.The raw depiction of brutality is what I believe attracted the people most to this show but really there is nothing more to it.Lastly Id like to add that 4 out 9 episodes (1,2,7 and 9 - it is really a shame that final episode is one of the weakest of the season/show) were boring and really low quality.I scored this one 6/10 and anyone that has seen more than just the most commercial bites from international cinematography can only agree.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is my first Korean series, I was excited watching each episode, it was seat edge thriller undoubtedly. A thriller roaler coaster ride. Episodes can't makes you up from sitting while watching this.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game tells an intriguing story and is very compelling. It is somewhat disturbing, brutal and fantastical in its storytelling of the class divide in society. Nevertheless, once you start watching you won't be able to stop. Most of the episodes are fantastic and really draw you into the story. The character development and story arcs are pretty solid, and the acting is phenomenal. I was also blown away by the set design, costumes and overall aesthetic. However, there is some plot points that I was not overly fond of. One being the whole organ harvesting side story. I understand that this was here to highlight there was an intruder amongst them but for me it just distracted from the story and overall aesthetic of the show. Another was the 'twist' that Il Nam was behind the whole thing. I could see this a mile off but hoped that because the show had been clever so far it wouldn't fall into this trap. I was left feeling a bit deflated by the scene with him and Seong Gi-Hun at the end. There are also some plot holes that are somewhat frustrating. Like how was Il Nam phoning the Front Man to check in. Especially when some of the other contestants were staying awake all night. Also, when the Front Man goes to check out the washed-up body and finds his brother's badge. Wouldn't he have known that the body was not his brother? Still he goes back to the island like the issue had been handled. I do think that the show could have benefitted from maybe being 10 episodes as the last three feel somewhat rushed and different tonally from the rest of the show. I am also slightly frustrated that we did not find out more about the Front Man, this side of the story is somewhat lacking. I know a lot of people have taken issue with the VIPs acting. However, this did not bother me as it just added to the obnoxious and disgusting personality of these characters. Finally, you will be mystified by Seong Gi-Hun's hairstyle choice at the end, but I believe it is him trying 'start fresh' or trying to take back control of himself after what happened. Kind of like when people get crazy hairstyles after a bad breakup. You will definitely be frustrated by Sae-Byoek's death but again for me it just highlighted that none of the characters, no matter how badass, were in control of what was going to happen. Lastly, you may be annoyed by Seong Gi-Hun's final decision to not get on the plane. However, I think this is showing that he is no longer going to just sit by and watch bad things happen to other people. This is a narrative of his character throughout. We know that he has PTSD from the riots during the protest at his work. Where he sat by and watched someone get killed and again with the drunk guy on the street in the final episode. He could have gone down and helped the guy, but he didn't or maybe the show is just saying that people don't change. Seong Gi-Hun is impulsive. Whatever the reason it is a great Segway for the next season.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I liked the cameras, the scenes where it looks like an animation movie (e.g. The stairs), and most of all the symmetry.The actors who play the VIPs are extremely bad at acting. I mean, what the hell?

"I've got high expectations towards this, because of the tsunami of memes - every still of this IS highly memeable - but ultimately it was a bit of a letdown. The overall feel is a decent mixture of a dozen movies from Stone's Any Given Sunday to Hitoshi Matsumoto's Symbol to Hunger Games to Train to Busan, to Truman Show to Shaolin Soccer to Midsommar etc... but it manages to feel exotic and somewhat unique - partly because of the language. The acting is superb, the production profesh, the design amazing, but ultimately nothing new, nothing original and the overall strength is in the details. As a whole, it fails to truly deliver, weak and shallow for true connoisseurs, and far more entry level than the tons of rave reviews suggest. Actually forgettable.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Amazing cinamatografy and writing although it occasionally felt a little too gloomy (to a point it might seem a little too unrealistic) it was certainly one of the best shows I've watched in a long time. I can't emphasize enough that this show is a series worth watching. (Though only teens and up I genuinly think it would be traumatizing for a child to watch this)",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A great narrative/concept which thrills the life out of any audience member. Despite Gi Sung being the primary protagonist there was always doubt in him due to the incompetence he had previously displayed. I genuinely thought Sang Woo would win as he showcased what a 'normal' person would do to live yet still related to us early on. In the games you would want to be Sang Woo, he is the most intelligent and is physically capable of passing the games and so you try to defend his choices until they devour you, similarly seen before with Walter White.However i do have a few issues with Squid Game.1. So the old man was behind it but wanted to get the thrill of playing. I jokingly guessed this as it seemed quite ridiculous. In the tug of war game he was inches away from dying but in the marble game where he actually lost, he lived anyway so the ""thrill"" he was talking about mustve been pretty pointless if he still had control.2. The detective sub plot is intriguing but the reveal is obvious and well... we don't exactly get closure as hes shot in the shoulder, oh... and he fell in water. He'll be perfectly fine for season 2 then.3. Gi Sung goes back to the games, abandoning his daughter and his character arc completion because he wants to know whos behind it? I thought we had concluded that it were just rich sociopaths who had no faith in humanity. I dont see how Gi Sung can gain anything from going back other than a 2nd season.I could praise the show for a while as the positives largely outweigh the negatives, i just thought i'd support the devil's advocate by asking questions that were being overlooked.8/10 Superb acting (the VIP's excluded), plot not as deep as you think.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Squid Game is suspenseful and comes with a great metaphore, but at the same time doesn't offer anything new, we have seen it all before and that with better acting, better twists and better writing, so I'm a bit surprised by the rating.At the end of the day it is enjoyable to watch, but do not expect this show to be anything more than a pastime, sorry to the fans.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

".It took me a while to finish this series but overall I liked it. I think most people know the premise of the story, but i think the competition and games are not the most important part of the series, but the social critique of capitalism, greed, selfishness and people's lack of empathy and solidarity and also, it has good character development and we stick to some of them.In relation to the technical parts i think they will border the perfection and we see the passion and care with the serie.However, the series has negative points, such as ease of scripting and predictable parts, plot twist without sense and forced and halfway through the series it took time to unravel the story, but nothing that spoils the experience.I highly recommend this series for those who haven't seen it and that this series is a door for many people who are still kind of prejudiced with films, series, etc. From cultures other than English or American, which I understand and that I am sometimes, but it is necessary to deconstruct these ideas and see that there is more outside our comfort zone.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"An emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to keep you at the edge of seat. The characters are great and despite not lasting long, form an everlasting impression on the audience, the show also touches on the subject of human nature and all that. My personal favorite character is Sangwoo, his development was just (chef's kiss).There's also well planned foreshadowing leading upto the big plot twist at the end that may not be visible at first watch.Although 9 episodes wasn't enough for this show, a lot of things were left unanswered like the In-Ho storyline, where does the organisation go from here, who they really are and what direction Gi-Hun's character will take from here. All of which are hinting for an exciting sequel.Although I'm slightly worried that S2 might not live up to the hype since well, everybody Died and the show has to build an even stronger cast of characters from scratch. Will the showrunners be able to succeed? We'll see.For now let's just make Netflix to fix their awful subtitles, it makes the dialogue look bad.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"So there's no denying that this is an entertaining show but come on people - what's all this hype about?!? The storyline itself is fairly unoriginal - although different...there are other movies based on a similar story (people playing a game against each other, resulting in death, secret societies, delving into humanities primal response to self-preservation etc.) and for the most part I found it totally predictable! Again - don't get me wrong...I enjoyed it - it was easy watching and a pleasant enough weekend binge but I genuinely do not understand the hype...there are far greater shows that deserve more credit than this. So in conclusion - watch it for yourself...but don't expect it to be mind-blowing.P.s. The dubbing is awful - please watch it in Korean with subtitles...much, much better!",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I don't like Korean TV series, but this is the first one that just won me over! Although it is a drama, but during the viewing it is not felt at all, the theme of the tragedy here is not what the director clings to. By the way, an interesting fact, the director wrote the script for about 10 years, in fact, this is his whole life's work. I also received a lot of rejections from film studios. The film is interesting, the acting is also at the highest level, I highly recommend watching it!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First five episodes are incredible.You get a mysterious setting with characters to which anyone can relate to, even if you are not a few million in debt.After the first five episodes however, things begin to crumble.You start getting fed information about the whole mystery which ruins the viewer's expectations as things like this are best left unknown.The whole plot line of the side cop Cho Sang-Woo who is looking for his brother and is trying to bring the games down is absolutely pointless, he accomplished nothing, only to find out that his own brother is pulling the strings.He dodges compromised guards, disgusting forced gay interactions and runs like a wild animal, outswimming a gps tracker underwater. One would think that they would at least see him passing them on the gps tracker.The old man Il-Nam who's ganbu tries to trick him in order to live, comes back from the dead, only to reveal nothing. His whole buildup and emotion during that episode where he initially dies is absolutely destroyed by having him be a plot twist VIP at the end.The rewatchability continues to crumble with each plot point.The games go from actual logic and quick thinking to absolute chance and stupidity. An entire character, Kang Sae-byeok dies from a level getting self destroyed? Like why? Why do you kill off a character in such a meaningless way. Yes Sang-Woo finishes her off, but brings absolutely nothing to the show. She would have had 5 minutes tops from the incredible blood loss due to a huge glass shard ending her.Yes the American VIPS are trash and the dialogue sucks, but they are not the worst part.The last final epic game that kids play in teams is decided to be a 1v1 as it's the show's epic name. SQUID GAME.The most boring ending game to have a 1v1 with. Would be a hundred times more entertaining if they added more people to it, as it's meant to be played.And to top it all off after our main protagonist gets out of there he is so shocked that he is late to treat his mother and she dies, that he absolutely forgets about his daughter, his friend's mother who somehow did not get her shop taken, as it was mentioned that his friend bet his mother's shop and the young girl Kang's little brother.It takes him a year to actually act and do something, because the old man reaches out to him and meets him one last time.And instead of meeting his daughter to be a good father for once in his life, like he earlier mentions a few times, he decides to be the big strong man and take the games down which had him mentally broken for a year.I understand that he did not want to spend the money, but at least take care of your friend's mom and a little boy. He could have even given a hand to Ali's family after he saved his life.When you get such an incredible start and so much potential in the beginning, it's not easy to keep up the quality. The actors played absolutely fantastic ,but the writers just did not handle those episodes well enough which pretty much ruins the buildup of the previous episodes.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Takes the physiological killer game show idea from anime and manga and adapts into live action. After you get past the premise you actually find well written characters and doomed relationships which is very refreshing for an Anime plot. You find yourself liking people and cursing their inevitable death. I loved the extra side plot refreshing from some of the boring games they played. Don't watch this for the premise watch it for the relationships.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Basically a Gore horror show like ""The Hostel"" but bubble tea store like colours and Costumes worn which gave the audience a thrilling experience of this ""weird feeling"" because our brains usually don't connect Horror with Happy colours.

"Seong Gi-hun is a gambling addict and owes a large amount to an unscrupulous loan shark. His addiction has wrecked his marriage and means he rarely sees his daughter. When a stranger offers him an opportunity to play a game that will potentially see his debts erased, he jumps at the opportunity. Little does he realise how deadly the game is.Highly entertaining and riveting viewing, and surprisingly so. I knew the series was about a game to the death for a prize but on the surface the plot seemed quite one-dimensional. Furthermore, the series doesn't start very well: the character sketching of the main character seems overly elaborate, there is a predictability with regard to where things are going and much of the first two episodes seems like filler.However, from a point things click into gear. No more filler as the games are revealed and played out, involving some intense action scenes and intriguing outcomes. Hardly one-dimensional: we get to know the characters, get to like some of them and be personally invested in their survival. Some of the games then pit our favourite characters against each other, making things even more intriguing and engaging. Some great sub-plots.Quite unpredictable too and teasingly so as the plot sets you up for an unoriginal development only for a great twist to occur.Highly interesting, engaging and entertaining.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The show is a bit overhyped but it has its reasons. It was good for a long while until the very end.I like the show from start til episode 8.The last episode felt like it ruined the good things in the show. I wouldn't discount the good story but I still cant get over what happened in the end. Is it just to have a second season? I wish it could have been done differently though. I would much rather have a good happy ending where he just lives normally with his daughter and adopt Sae-Byeok's brother not just leave money for an old woman to take care of.The show isncalled squid game but the final game didnt really justify squid game properly as they both end up fighting for survival. I mean at least make the series reasonable with its title. We spend so much minutes on ther challenges and we could barely get 30 minutes on squid game.He could have straightened his life instead of going after the squid game organizers.Also what happened to the cop? There was no definitive ending for him. Was he really dead? Was was there no closure for him and his brother?But I wouldnt discount the good plot. Overall I like the story. It is really good and the characters really showed passion in their work. There were some hit and miss especially when the vips came to the scene, they have the worse acting.Overall, This is still a great series just really cant get over the final episode.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

It gets interesting and extremely bloody and thrilling and I couldn't stop watching and found myself often wondering what I would do if in their situation. The main character became less annoying and I eventually grew to enjoy him as a character and really rooting for him. I actually guessed the twist very earliest but enjoyed it none the less.

With that said, I do welcome all the new K-drama viewers and hope that it's not just a one off.The show itself highlight a very important social issue that hits so close to home. The games in the show itself appear very simple yet are intense and maybe plausible if anyone were to be in the same situation.The conclusion however left a little more to be desired. The main characters decision's seems questionable.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story.

"I would highly recommend to someone looking for something to watch, if they take it in the spirit intended.Squid Game was a show that I unavoidably watched late. The hype and everyone talking about it (either loving or hating it) meant I just had to give it a go. I had a feeling I would be disappointed and left with a forgettable drama which draws its viewers from its bizarreness.I couldn't have been more wrong. I found the story to be, besides a few stretches, reasonably grounded in reality. The focus for me was the characters, which were well written and well acted. The story gripped me and I thought the games themselves were tense and kept me hooked. I thought it remained consistent throughout and finished off with a strong ending that does justice to the series. Overall, I was really impressed with all aspects of it, and is something I'd more than happily watch again and I'm glad I watched it.One last point i'll put is I watched it with subtitles, if you can read I don't understand why anyone would pick otherwise. It adds to the authenticity and viewing experience.In conclusion, good story, good acting and good show all around;9/10.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

But by the 4th eps it's dragging quite a bit and they make a scene ensuring that all the games are of ""fair play"".Two games later they throw out this concept and it's all based on luck instead of skill. Absolutely terrible games of chance.This dude shopped this project around for 10 years before Netflix picked it up. Maybe in that time he should have had a few buddies proof read the script and give him some pointers. This needs work.I'm sure that there will be a season 2 for this, hopefully with some better talent can help this dude write a better script.

"I'm Korean, and people around me kept telling me to watch this show so I decided to try it. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It brought much more emotional attachment that many Western shows, and I liked how the show wasn't very predictable. For example, I loved OBX but it felt a little repetitive to the point I started watching it more for the characters than the plot itself. However, this show really did well in terms of both the character development and plot.Also, I've seen reviews saying the Netflix subtitles were inaccurate. But idk, I thought it was well written (as a bilingual person) I loved the dubbings too bc the voices really matched.Lastly, to address the VIP scene, many people said they were poor actors and had cringe lines.I think the lines embodied the American culture pretty well for a Korean crew. At this point, yall should be thankful it wasn't worse. Also, since not a lot of foreigners live in Korea, it would have been difficult to pick up actual actors for the show.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up.

Children's games that if you lose, you die, in horrible bloody circumstances. Whittling the players down to one ultimate cash prize winner. So there's a lot of violence and death. Now, this programme could have been higher rated had it not been for one thing: The VIPs. My gosh how embarrassingly cringeworthy are they! They ought to be glad their faces were mainly hidden! I'm not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though. They really let the show down. However, i'll still give it an 8 for the concept, production and delivery and the Korean actors.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series is so similar to Alice in Boarderland, except only that the crew added flamboyant sets and symbols to make it pretentious. At first I was at least amazed by the idea ""game of killing in another world"", but after comparing it to Alice, which was shot before Squid Game, I can not give it any kudos. Squid Game speeded up the whole scenario to be eye-catching, but that left the characters shallow and predictable. And the story used too much technique. For example, they didn't elaborate on the deep emotions between players (like the couple), in which case they would make irrational decisions. They only depicted the connection of some new friends, who would not have the strong emotion as close ones. Focusing on the dark side looks cool, but that's not gonna make it a classic. It's like a dish with too much MSG.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"My kids on my back to watch it, so watched first episode, bit over the top for me and didn't think much of the first episode, but then watched the second and I got hooked, watched the whole series, this not perfect but bloody close, it got me in and I enjoyed the first season allot so much I'm watching it again. I can see why it is so popular and now I have to wait for second season. Really worth watching but warning allot of blood and gore.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"In an era of binge watching & streaming any thing which manages to create a hype will find viewers. Now are you willing to take a moment to think before committing 9 hours for squid game or you just cant resist the trend and dont care about time anyway; is the question.For the thinkers out there! You dont even need to see the trailer to guess you are in for some thing like ""Hunger games"". The plot once again takes a jibe at capitalism and unequal distribution of wealth which is still fresh in our minds thanks to oscar loaded ""Parasite"". The plot is marred with implausables!!! Notwithstanding the debt crises, would someone be desperate and suicidal enough to put his life in the line with just 1 in 456 chance of winning??Squid Games does a good job in exploiting nostalgia of childhood games, thrill of puting life at stake and natural curosity of guessing the winner. The plot is unidirectional and an odd effort done to mitigate that is not more than a distraction and fails miserably in the end anyway. The storyline and some remarkable acting performances are at their peak around episode 6 and its all downhill afterwards. Even after the winner becomes obvious the climax brings some thought provoking takeaways on how money fails to provide pleasure and satisfaction to the filthy rich and the things they can resort to just for the forgotten taste of happiness.The violance is too much and seems like a deliberate effort to make life seem so indispensible. On the face of it we all are adult enough to know its all part of the entertainment bizz..but what havoc it may play with our subconscious, i am no expert to predict...",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Thought it'd be more intellectual but just a lot if violence, gore, bad acting, and more violence. Called the main plot line in the first show. If the games were more thoughtful, this could have been good. And suicide so many times? Organ harvesting? Geez, check more boxes.Skip it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game is a south-korean series that contains 9 episodes is one series.The creator of the program is Hwang Dong-Hyeok, the genre of the serie is drama , horror. Thriller .The story is about people in financial difficulty being invited to a mysterious survival competition.Participating.in a series of children's games but with deadly twists, they risk their lives for a large sum of money.I liked this series because it is intriguing, we want to continue the episodes to know what will happen.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I'm on episode 5 and I'm considering giving up on the show. It's obviously not my cup of tea but I can't see how this many people like it. It's mediocre at best. I especially hate the character interaction. It's so unrealistic. There are many plot holes already.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"The show is great, well worth a watch. Fantastic concept, brilliantly executed with some stellar acting and directing.But the English dub is.. laughably bad. The show drops from an 8/10 to a generous 5/10 when you watch it on the dub.Ignoring the atrocious acting from the English side of Squid Game, as soon as you switch it back to Korean, it instantly turn back into a beautiful piece of television, appealing to anyone aged 14 or over.An expert on cinema, or a bored Netflix subscriber with nothing else to do; both will enjoy it equally as this is one of the best shows Netflix has released. I would definitely recommend watching. It has some thrilling twists, fabulous performances from the Korean actors, and overall a great story. If you haven't yet - watch Squid Game. And watch it the way it was intended...",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show provided some quick binge-worthy entertainment but is incredibly overrated. Some of the dramatic moments (especially deaths) in the storyline feel so incredibly clich챕 and poorly written it is hard to feel any surprise/ sadness but instead just boredom.The concept of course is interesting, but the whole ""games to entertain rich people"" concept has been played out in better ways before.Nonetheless, the actors (except the VIPs) are good to great and the artistic direction is awesome.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game (2021)
Created by Hwang Dong-hyuk""The truth is always more heroic than the hype.""
Jessica LynchPandora boxes come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. Amongst them, Hype trains are one of the colossal, if not the most colossal forms prevailing around right now. There are hardly any aspects that can escape the tout blanket devised by the internet community. But, take nothing away, 'Squid Game' definitely stands out to be one of the most intricately enticing shows ever set in motion.Converging a stiffly contrasting set of genres into one, 'Squid Game' furnished a fantastic surge-filled intrigue to the global audience throughout its limited run spanning just 9 episodes. One of the most striking ingredients is that the makers managed to deliver a sucker punch, should I call it rather a KO blow for the kinda impact it had. Many biggies failed in doing so in the past despite having a sizeable script and having moderate longevity.Putting forth the spotlight on the suffering and deprived class of South Korea, the show trudges on forward with copious amounts of twists and turns by pushing the 456 participants to the absolute limits of humanity and make them question the moral code more often than not. With absurdity and surrealism in substantial portions, it gave the writing a license to thrill. 'Terrific' would be an understatement as long as 'making the audience bite their nails on the edge-of-their-seats' feeling is concerned.There is scarcely any room untaken to point fingers at the acting in 'Squid Game' as every single actor on the screen has beautifully engineered and pulled off spellbinding performances; no doubt about that. In a world where the Korean culture is ravaging up the Earth through the music industry, 'Squid Game' has just become the cherry on top of the exponentially growing Korean domination.The reason I believe why 'Squid Game' rose to fame in such a quick period is its atypical unconventionality in making. For the generation that's been built on fantasy, action, adventure, 'Squid Game' came in as a captivating breath of fresh air.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Unlike some other comments, this is LIKE other things I've already seen or heard of. It's a built on a bunch of different already used ideas, and put together into a smart package that pleases the directed target group (which is basically everyone), which was *told* to watch and enjoy this show. Marketing wise these creators hit the jackpot and the hype train is real.Almost any fast going series can get really captivating and easy to binge nowadays, and the only thing original is that this one got to the extreme when it comes to exposure and word-of-mouth.I'm not saying it's a bad series but when the hype is over and people might reflect again it will probably be viewed as the 6 to 7 rated series that it is. Those who can recite the happenings in the series a month after watching it are welcome to prove me wrong though.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The show is so popular for what? It isn't even that good. The story line was poor and the plot twist too. It also make no sense at all. It was only popular Bcz it's on Netflix and the actor Wi ha joon and hoyeon jong r pretty and hot. Theire acting isn't bad but not the best. I watch it till the end and at first it wasn't that bad and it could've been better but it just got worse. There r sm k dramas that deserve more hype like sweet home, the penthouse, hotel del luna etc.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
One of best series I have ever watched. The story is so simple but effective and extraordinary. The games are so relatable yet bloody dangerous. That old man is the heart of this story. There are lots of things you can relate in your daily life with this story. Outstanding.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I don't have words good enough to explain how much I liked this show. Absolutely brilliant presentation of the modern-day times and twisted values. I watched it three times already, and I just can't get enough. Never seen anything like this before. Breathtaking.I understand lower ratings, tho. Squid Game is definitely not a show for people who are not yet ready to admit in what kind of world we are living. They will find it illogical, stupid, unnecessary finally. But the truth is that Squid Game is telling us what we all already know, but many are afraid to admit. We are all puppets, players in some other people's games.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Very addictive. The most intense tug of war scene ever. This show will keep you curious, entertained and anxious the whole time. By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
So surprised by the low reviews. The acting and story line is fantastic. I felt every episode kept you in suspense and you become really attached to the characters. I highly recommend watching in the original Korean. Much better.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Those who could not walk at the required pace...were shot.I like this show so far. I'm on episode 4. It is pretty well made and makes me want to watch the next ""chapter"" Could it be better? Yes, but the story is good and it's alright the way it is.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Cube, Escape Room, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games....etc! Seems that mortal combats for the pleasure of elites has become very popular lately.Well, to be honest, it could have been so much better if it was made in America. A great plot though, some great lines(as well as cheesy ones) and twists but still lacks something in between. Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
So overrated.Watched in fast forward since it's full of soup for the soul long scenes.Seen much better ones with similar theme..,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"A very disturbing series to watch, however, once you start it you cannot put it of your mind until you finish all 9 episodes. The idea is new and crazy and fun to watch. But it feels unreal. You don't want this to EVER happen to ANYOME at ANYTIME!A shoutout to the soundtracks!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This Korean drama/series makes me remind of black mirror a lot because of the system of the game and the VIPs. I didn쨈t like how the VIPs talked because it seems they were reading... This serie talk about the things that someone is capable of doing to earn money, even kill the dearest person for you. Not everything it is what seems in this drama.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Honestly, one of the best series to watch. The most unexpected twist is the old man. I just loved this series. I would say one of the best series released this year. Worth to watch.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Not original at all but refreshing to see this theme played by good Corean actors.Apparently the gender and bla agenda is not a must for Corean series. Which is fine by me.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
I don't understand why people were overhyping this average series. Very predictable. I can list you 10 better series/movies with more mind-bending plot twists.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"As a mother, I recommend especially young people to stay away from this series, it is a very harmful series even for an adult with normal psychology, the age group is +18 and the suicidal tendency is increasing in the young people who follow it, if you care about your child, do not allow watch it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Excellent Korean TV Series and what a great performance from the actors and actresses! The VIPs weren't that good, but it didn't effect how much I enjoyed the series.Very well made with lots of nail biting moments. I can't wait to see the next season!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I can't say this is a ""spoiler alert"" because everyone else is harping on the subject.Many people reviewing this series are hung up on how well the ""VIPs"" can act. Think of it another way, can they just be ordinary people whom just come on for a ""guest"" appearance? Do they actually have to act?Remember the ""rich"" people of the world are self centered and don't really care if one is injured or not. Why would they want to have lines that actually mean something?",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"First of all, what a series ! It looks so realistic compared to Alice in Borderland or Hunger Games. The VIPs acting were so bad and so fake ruining the contestants realistic acting.Some plot holes that are bugging me.1. What happened to the VIP guy that went to a room with the police and got photo taken with his phone? Did he threaten the Front Man for this incident or sue the game maker ?2. Why keeping all paper files of the squid Games? Everything are digitalized and looks so hi-tech with scanner, surveillance, etc. It doesn't make sense3. The old guy is already 'dead' in the marble game when he took of the mask and talked to the Front Man to greet the VIPs for him (ep.7). And at the same moment he explained (ep.9) to the Front Man he wanted to be down there join the game because it's more fun.What happened to the police and his phone whether all the photos were sent, we still don't know whether he is still alive or dead. Looking forward to season 2 (if there is any)",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Even though the first 2 episodes weren't that amazing I loved it and would watch it again, but do not let your kids watch it. It is a lot of gore and very realistic so if you can't handle it I don't recommend it but if you can watch it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A Korean series that shows a group of people who are put in a deadly game for money until one wins and manages to survive. We saw the story before but it has moments that are captivating, the message of social criticism is interesting. Obviously it's not perfect there are script conveniences, moments when the story is unnecessarily slowed down. It's worth it anyway.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is our society.If you want to see a nice series, choose it.This film is full of meaning and concept of our current society in which we live. We are all in some kind of bad situation like this.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I truly enjoyed this show from the beginning but eventually less and less when people started comparing it to some of the greats.Squid Game is meaningful and has a strong message against capitalism but what people fail to see somehow its a rip off of Alice in borderland..In a nutshell, You will enjoy watching this but don't let the hype get to you.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I found this show to be very entertaining. It was fun, the suspense was terrific, and rather then cliffhangers after an episode, they had the, throughout the episode. A solid watch imo. Many little things were also no predictable which was good. One thing I knew was the ending. I wouldn't had known if it wasn't for ep 7 when the host said they couldn't host. If you focus on a small detail you'd know too I think. Overall very good showing.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"No spoiler here, just a recommendation. In my mind it's only 8 episodes long. Episode 8 is short, so just add 20 mins of episode 9 on top of it, and stop at the moment it says ""X amount of time later!"" Nothing else worth your time after then, the next 40 minutes serves to be quite damaging, as far as the story is concerned. The end point I recomend is really appropriate. Well, go past that point, but just pretend that segment is part of a bad dream!",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I don't think it's worth the hype, the games were overall boring and dragged out far too long.I didn't find any of the characters particularly likeable, some were just outright annoying from the off.It's probably worth a watch if you've nothing else, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression like any other series of similar storyline.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Would give it 10 if it ended with an ending.Please don't ruin this with a second season.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"That's the best thing about streaming services. Without them we would never watch a series like that! This was my first Korean series I ever watched and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last. Keep them coming on netflix! We need more countries to get the opportunity to show they can provide us with something worth watching! The show was great, the acting was amazing and unlike most battle royale types of shows i've seen, i actually cared for many characters! I loved it, i enjoyed every minute of it and i'm surely coming back at a possible second season.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"POSITIVES :-First, the CONNECTIONS between two characters are plotted so nice.Second, the STORY PLOTTING is also good except in episode 2.Third, the BGM also performed his work amazingly. It supported the visuals so nicely.Fourth, ACTING done by each character is very natural.Fifth, i love the INNOCENCE shown in movie, specially of two characters - main character and that old man.Sixth, as i wrote in title, CINEMATOGRAPHY is lifeline of this movie. I am unable to describe it.Seventh, the SETS are also amazing, i like the place where those games held.Eighth, i love the GORE SCENES that are shown in the movie, specially that first kill in the first game. Omg, that gave me so pleasure.Ninth, the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is also good.NEGATIVES:-First, the STORY of the movie is so WEAK & PREDICTABLE. The story is said to be the soul of any series. But squid doesn't focus on this.Second, i know that the series doesn't kill its main character, so we already know the game results from the beginning that the main character doesn't lose. Still series stretch the length of the game unnecessarily.Third, there are so many FILLER SCENES which can be easily removed.Fourth, plotting of DEATHS are not so Impactful. I can't feel anything.Fifth, it is so DRAMATICAL in some episodes. And i don't like drama so much.Sixth, the last episode gives me so much irritation because i expected that all the mysteries were solved in this episode. But this web series doesn't give a satisfying explanation of the game like who is the owner or head behind this, and why did they do it and how it can be hidden from all governments of the world etc.That's all from my side.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Really enjoyed this Korean series, It's like Takashi's Castle with a story and severe consequences full of gore, violent and twists and holds no punches which is what I've come to expect from Korean series/movies. The only only criticism is that the VIP's acting was awful and I hope if a 2nd series is made they get rid of the English speaking actors. I've also watched Alice in Borderland which was good but this is better and more interesting. I would recommend this series and hope there is a second. If you enjoyed this, watch Battle Royale the ""Hunger games"" superior original.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The series takes specific aim at South Korea but it's certainly universal in 2021, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has laid bare so many injustices. Superb acting performances heighten the drama and particularly from Lee, who makes Gi-hun irresistibly likable despite his many defects. All of the characters undergo enormous trauma and the actors rise to the challenge of portraying believable emotions in a very unbelievable setting.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I really really enjoyed this. The acting from the Korean actors was incredible, all of them were brilliant and so believable. All the interactions between the players in the early games were so great, especially Gi-Hun, Ming-Wae and Sang-Woo. Yes the English actors were crap but it didn't really detract from it, if anything it made them more creepy and added to the atmosphere that they saw themselves as Gods.Don't want to spoil it but honestly it's so worth a watch. As awful as it is, it highlights the terrible things that possibly happen in the world.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I don't really get all the hype. This is far from a masterpiece in any way, but it's entertaining. It's a little bit like Prison Break, lots of flaws but entertaining. The concept is really nothing new, just a rehash of the Hunger Games (which was pretty much a blatans rip-off of Battle Royale) and the acting sometimes reminds you of silent movies from a hundred years ago. Maybe that's a cultural thing though, I don't know, but Parasite didn't suffer from this. Never the less it brings you out of the story.I really wish it was as good as it's hyped up to be because I really like the concept. I feel the same way about this as I felt about Hard Target when that came out: ""Why film did you have to let me down?!""",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I am not one to follow the hype train usually but I just finished watching this and I have to say if you haven't seen this one then you're missing out! The way it grips you from the very start and doesn't let go is something to be applauded. Without spoiling anything all I can talk about is how the show made me feel... it is brutal and I am not talking about the violence. Part psychological drama, part social commentary and filled with twists and turns this one is not one to miss!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"An amazing work of art, direction, script, production and screenplay. Completely engaging until the very last episode. However, the director and his aides made a terrible decision by ending it how it ends. The entire build up to the very last episode comes down crashing for me towards the end of it.It made me change my rating from 8/10 to 6/10.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Just as the title reads. This series is an emotional ride on every single level, and I believe there is so much an actor can convey in a scene that transcends language. After finishing the series I checked out the English dubbed version and it was painful to watch; all of that powerful tone, inflection, emotion - gone and replaced by poorly-acted robotic American voices. These actors are extremely talented and you deserve to experience their performance to the fullest extent possible. Watch the Korean version - it will enrich your viewing experience greatly.The hype around this show was so intense that I went in assuming my expectations wouldn't be met - and they were far exceeded. It's difficult for me to put into words how fantastic I thought this series was, but it wow'ed me on every level. The sets are absolutely mesmerizing, the score is haunting, the acting is superb, the characters are flawed and complex, and the storyline(s) are very well thought-out. I keep finding myself returning to Netflix/YouTube to rewatch scenes from the show because they struck me so deeply. I hope for a 2nd season, I'd love to watch regardless of which direction it goes in!! Absolutely mind blowing show.I would use caution if you are sensitive to death & violence. Even if you're not terribly sensitive either, to be honest. This show doesn't hold back!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"68/100I finally decided to finishe this show after being on my list for months. I don't have much to say other than to highlight the inconsistency of the script of its episodes, which became extremely annoying after a few chapters.For instance, episode 6 is easily the best episode of the entire series. Right after, you are introduced to one of the worst; it's almost as if you have to reward those moments when Squid Game truly shows its innovation. That's why the ending, although disappointing, I can't be surprised at the fact that it was executed in such a way.Speaking of whether or not this series is truly innovative, it definitely has its own quirky streak, one that the series isn't afraid to exploit almost 100%. Many times these moments may not work for me taking into account the contrasting contextualization that the program possesses but, one way or another, it's still appreciated.Impressive performances by the cast but that can be affected once certain new characters enter.The only thing that really remained throughout the program was its technical aspects. It got to a point where I was blown away by some of the editing decisions the series would make. They would seem simple, but they are refreshing to see for a series with so many ""action"" scenes.Squid Game fully understood how to stand out, which is why it will become one of the most remembered shows in the coming years. However, popularity never meant quality, and this might be the best example of that saying yet.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I've recently seen it compared to Alice In Borderland and I must say Squid Game is far superior for the storyline, character development and eerie message of what lengths human beings will go to for money when feeling desperate.The only moment I questioned the show was during the first half of episode 2 which slowed down a bit but picked up again within the second half.After that I was glued to it and by the end I was left hoping for a season 2.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSEASON ONESeong (Lee Jung-Jae) is down on his luck, addicted to gambling and in debt to vicious loan sharks, not to mention eager to reacquaint with his estranged son. At his lowest ebb, he finds himself approached by a man at a train station, who offers to take care of his financial woes if he agrees to participate in a secretive ritual. With no choice but to accept, Seong finds himself plunged, with a group of others, in to a nightmarish, garish battle for survival.Korean cinema has enjoyed some recent worldwide acclaim, with cult hits such as Parasite and The Platform leaving quite an impression. But this year it's enjoyed this again in a TV format, with this mind-bending visceral blow from writer/director Hwang Dong-hyuk. It's sheer outrageousness and visual astonishment is enough to leave an impression, and even sparked some copycat behaviour around the world, with reports of people reenacting some of the 'games' portrayed.It comes together like a fusion, of the wildest excesses of the most fantastical Phillip K Dick novel, and the most blood thirsty Quentin Tarantino film, with a fairly standard format of a group of strangers being thrown together to fight for survival, which has been portrayed in films such as Cube. Like the aforementioned films, there seems to be some societal commentary thrown in, such as increasing poverty and the gap between rich and poor, as well as the depths 'reality TV' could sink to in the name of 'entertainment.'It's definitely been the runaway hit of 2021, that's left quite an impression, and gained quite a cult status, that, in spite of its excessive gruesomeness, can safely be said to be earned. ****",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Very good story and acting. The VIP's were a bit excess tho.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Just another hyped up show with a plot that has been reused over and over again. It's basically a poorly written copy of the hunger games but Korean. The dubbing is terrible and the acting is even worse. The ending is so predictable its laughable. Honestly i fast forwarded through most of because it is incredibly boring for most of each episode. Also Every single character except one is a garbage excuse for a human being and deserves what happens to them.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was hesitant to watch it at first because of all the hype surrounding it. But I gave in in the end and I'm so glad I did. Binge-worthy series. Original plot and highly entertaining. I was happy to rewatch it with my partner who was late to the party. Minus 1 star for the horrible acting from the VIPs. But it's ok, they're hardly in it and so thankful for that. The rest of the actors were great! The old man/ player #1 was my favourite and his character brought so much to the story. Great character development and story in general.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"An incredible show. I wasn't expecting something like this from Netflix. The name turned me off from watching this show for a while but I'm glad I finally played it. I'd say some episodes are on par with the level of Breaking Bad. A very entertaining and frightening dark comedy. It says a lot about our society today. Hollywood doesn't make shows like this. South Korea does this type of movies so well. Parasite was a great movie and Oldboy is in its own league. I really wish America made more shows like this that talk about the reality of living here. The wealth gap and the difference in living standards is crazy. But there are no good shows that capture the harsh economic situation the country is in right now. To the rich, it's a comedy. To the poor, it's reality.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I do love my typical hero's journey Marvel/DC movies/series but this one was something different entirely, a breath of fresh air.Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Squid Game was definitely the most famous show of 2021, and I am a bit late to the party by a couple of years, but god damn this show is violent.First of all, it's definitely overhyped. I watched all episodes and was like ""ok that's cool, but not what people make it out to be"". Granted it is good for a Korean show (I had Korean audio and English subtitles) especially a Netflix show, but I was more invested in the storyline outside of the games than the actual games themselves.I found it unnecessarily violent, just people rapidly and violently stabbing others (especially the lights out scene like god damn) and the blood was a bit over the top.The games themselves were entertaining enough but like I said I actually found the storyline more interesting, and only really liked the episodes from episode 6, the first weren't great to me.I'm not trying to sound controversial but I didn't mind the VIP acting as much as other people hate it, I did find it irritating but didn't really mind it and I just felt it was part of the story. I did feel the show was great at making you side with characters, I really started to hate the guy with the dragon tattoo and then he died and I was literally cheering.Overall: overhyped, those weary of blood and violence should definitely avoid. I'll probably watch season 2, only because I'm invested in the storyline.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"You have probably heard about the Squid game, the TV show from Netflix launched in 2021. Well, it has become famous because of its plot and content, which has been able to attract the most different audiences, from children to adults, from several places around the world. In fact, it has broken a lot of records, mainly in views and, likewise, it is worth mentioning that it has been an award-winning film; that is why it has also been the subject of much commentary, both for and against. Without further ado, I will share my main personal evaluations on the subject to also argue that this is a TV show that is quite difficult to analyze and therefore requires a nuanced observation, which should not forget the criticality.In the first place, we could highlight the social criticism in that the competitors in the ""game"" are the underprivileged of society, the marginalized, who have to save their lives without any other alternative, with the only motivation of winning a huge prize that is almost impossible to win. At this point it is worth clarifying that, within the context, this specificity in the material conditions of each one is not a coincidence, indeed, it can be affirmed that what the series wants to show in the background is the purge of the poor, those who are left over, those people who received a letter of invitation to participate in what I would call a purification game. This idea is reinforced by the setting in which the game takes place, an uninhabited and remote island; that is, it is as if it were a premeditated discreet conspiracy that the population could not find out about.In contrast to the previous, it is impossible to avoid the negative side of it, because I was really disappointed by the predictability of the series, because from the beginning of the TV show it is clearly evident the main character, Seong Gi-hun, or Player 456, and how detailed the development of the production becomes with this particular character, and precisely this was my experience with the series, in fact, the ending of the series did not cause me any impression or perplexity, as it happens with other famous series that catch you off guard at the end.The two previous points allow me to reach my conclusion, which is that I recommend watching the series, but not from the point of view that observes it superficially, but from the social criticism of our present and the crisis that much of the world's population is going through, the helplessness and invisibilization. So that the viewer can get the thought-provoking facet of the TV show, which generates more advantage in its message.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I really don't get why everybody's gushing over this piece of mediocrity. Honestly, it does not deserve the 8.6, and it does not deserve all the hype around it. There wasn't anything original or anything others hadn't done better before. I'd give it a 5/10, for being perfectly average if it stole only 2-3 hrs of my life rather than a whopping 9, but here we are. I kept watching in the hopes that something crazy was about to happen, right until the end, that justified all the craze, and was left disappointed when it finally ended. Give it a pass if you have anything slightly better than average to watch instead.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"A really good show that is hard not to binge watch on the first day. Almoast every aspect is well design : Scenario, light, photography and sound. A thrilling and strange story that you can't stop holdin on. I recommanded it to my mother and i wasn't expecting her to love it but she did and she watched the all season in about 3 days. It really grabs on your curiosity and it is very emotionaly dense with lots of good caracters. I've never had such a cinematographic experience. A good mix of thrilling action and melancolic sadness. Caution to the fainted hearth it is quite violent.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This is a very enticing show that pulls people in with the silly but dark concept on its own, but what makes the show stick out is the strong character relationships that are built out of a bunch of strangers.I'm a sucker for a good survival show (as proven by my love of The Walking Dead, early Fear The Walking Dead, and The 100) but who actually died in each game was very predictable. Nonetheless each death super emotional and sad. They gave you a reason to care for everyone.I did not like the plot twist at the ending and while it was cool in some ways, it ruined the shows best scene without giving a proper explanation to anything.They've set up for a Season 2 on a show that could've finished with a more conclusive singular season. Still, I'm intrigued.Also, the dub is bad but does not ruin the show, still worth watching either way.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"If you like action movies then this one is a higly recommended series from South Korea. Cast and actresses are insane.Compaired with other shows, this one is extremly shocking since Squid Game based on a real game and came out during COVID-2019 but personally for me, therefore extremly likely.On one hand, the story line is relatively simple but on the other hand, absolutely interesting how people would sacrifice themself for money and put all one's eggs in one basket. I can identify myself to help others like this way but just for money, I would never do that.Cause of bloody scenes, Squid Game is entirely off-limits for children or people with low tolerance for violence.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Sadly my fellow westerners are hesitant to subtitles but luckily some great series like this one get picked up in the mainstream giving them the recognition deserved.This is as such, and the hype is deserved.Yes the VIP come across as ruining it but I hate to say it, our western loud entitled abrasive personalities is what they are perpetuating and I find the annoyingness of watching the VIP reflects how rude we come across in other cultures and is actually warranted.My only complaint with the series is the ending, I get it but slightly drawn out and clearly just to set up a second season. Otherwise we'll worth the watch.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Normally, I'm not a big fan of Korean series and music. But here I have to say well done to the director and the actors of this series. I'm not a big fan of series in general, because I never get hooked and get bored very easily. So I am someone who watches a lot of film and hardly ever a series. This time around is the first time I've ""LOVED"" a series and hooked it from start to finish. The story is original and it feels like a kind of hunger game, with characters who are in dire straits and who fight until the end to win a huge amount of money. The fact that the series is really different from all the other series is that it has its own universe, its own setting. Watching this series is like a drug. We are addicted and we want more, we want to know more things. We easily get attached to the characters because we pity them enough. And I think it's a good lesson in morale, this series certainly represents, a little exaggerated, today's society. I can only advise you. If I had to give this series a rating, it would be 19/20 because season 2. We can't wait !!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid Game, a Korean Netflix TV Series that made an unexpected hit and blew up worldwide with a whopping 111 million views since its debut mid-September. I only recently finished the show, but I have friends who finished it a couple weeks back and are still ""hyping it up."" The director took us on quite the interesting journey through the plot, starting with sympathetic feelings towards the players, to disgust, to thrillers, and perhaps to anger as well. Starting from the first episode, the Squid Game seemed a childish, but promising way of attaining financial freedom for the players. That is until everyone learned the term eliminated referred to being eliminated from existence itself, meaning death. The blood and gore were not only gruesome and scary for the players of the game, but also for the audience that was watching. I remember flinching and jumping out of my seat when the first player was shot down in the Red Light Green Light game, knowing his death was coming, yet somehow still unexpected and shocking. The game was designed such so that it was immoral to proceed since the billions of won, as the reward money for winning, was being accumulated based on the deaths of other players. However, this is where the true nature of everyone showed. The true nature of humans. It didn't matter if you were native, foreign, religious, male, female, smart, thug, or whatever, everyone suddenly developed a greed for money and lost all their morals. I think the director wrote the plot this way to expose the ""natural"" greed all humans have, and to show the audience to what extremes people would go for their personal gain. I think this show is a reminder to all people that the world is not as innocent as some people may think. It is a world filled with lies and deceit built to support those in power, or otherwise the rich. This brings me to another point the director makes evident in the last few episodes. Money truly cannot buy everything in this world, especially not happiness, which we learned from Il Nam, host of the squid games, but also a player. We learn that everyone has their own problems with life, the only difference is that the circumstances are different. Overall, it was a good TV Show for entertainment, but I think it should be more of an eye-opening experience for viewers to wake up to reality.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"From the start to finish, the show is an emotional roller coaster. Full of mystery and suspense. Only downside I'd say is that, due to nature of the show, we had an idea who would win. All main characters were quickly realised and we had a expectation that who'd make it. Not as suspenseful as perhaps Game of thrones. I mean I know its only 9 part show and the show runner had no idea where it would go.It's a crime that it's been sitting on shelf for 12 years before someone gave it a GREEN LIGHT. I mean we could have been on season 12 or perhaps it would have ended by now.I personally can't wait for season 2.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's an interesting concept for sure. But the scene where the VIPs arrived looking like they were ready to perform in The Masked Singer is just so dumb.Plus rows of identical cars boarding a ferry at night seems like the kind of thing that would get flagged as suspicious.And the cop not calling for backup? Running directly in the line of sight of the rear view mirror. A game that has been going on for years and yet no security at the gates. Choosing to go at it alone. Risking it all for his 1 kidney brother. That's just senseless.Evading the armed troops in a labyrinth littered with cameras is also senseless.I felt like the revelation of the anarchy rule in the dorms was a bit rushed. A small guy attacking a thug with a freaking face tattoo while he was with his group of thugs is something that I do not see happening. Then the small guy dying so quickly.Given that you can just kill each other in the dorm, Deok-su could have killed Mi-nyeo with his bare hands but he didn't.Back to the VIPs. They are my main gripe. The awful script. Goodness gracious. I had to pause every few lines because it was just abysmal.I thought the painted naked people were unnecessary.All that aside I did enjoy the show overall. The games were simple yet creative. And I always love a good tug of war.I thought they did good by restarting the contest with those who chose to come back eyes wide open. You feel less for them since they chose their own destiny.The story was also insightful. The portrayal of gambling addiction. Predatory lending in South Korea. The concept of throwing good money at bad and going for broke. Chasing the ever elusive dream of winning big money. I also liked how they covered the topic of religious hypocrisy.I loved the characters they created.Massive spoilers below.It was obvious who the stronger guy was. He is also exponentially smarter. Yet somehow at the end he was a flailing idiot who could not anticipate obvious moves from the offensive and instead just attacking widly. Makes no sense.It was a bit too obvious who the finalists would be.And it was a bit obvious that the old man was in on it when they did not show his death. Tried a bit too hard to be poetic at the end.But Gi-hun coming out looking like freaking Party Poison at the end was hilarious.The fact that he took the kid and just gave him to the old woman was such a typical useless dad thing to do.Leaving his mother without a caretaker, is a typical useless son thing to do. Always with the grand noble intentions. Far too little, far too late.Then turning his back on his daughter, is really typical also.If you are a bad son, and a bad father, all the money in the world cannot change that. Just because you are not evil does not mean that you are a good person.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The actors did a great job very strong performance. Then the further it went the worst it got. With some questionable decision that didn't make much sense.Also the biggest plot hole. They put around 38 million dollar on a person bank account. A person who dont even have a job. The account would been freezed. And the tax Investigations special unit will get involved. Money have to be laundered correctly I learned that from Breaking Bad LolAnd this blood game have been played many times before. Money can be traced its not bitcoins.

Don't watch it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I'm not sure how many times I've watched it again, but after seeing it once more and growing more mature and perceptive about things I might have missed the first time throughout, I think this is the most painful and intense I've ever felt for these characters. The writing and execution by the performers and writer were phenomenal; we felt as though we truly got to know the major characters and had greater empathy for them, which made their deaths seem all the more authentic to us as viewers. It's similar to attending a funeral for someone you've never met or spoken to, yet you still feel sympathy for them because they were someone's baby, elder or younger sibling, father or mother, etc. It just causes you to consider how you would feel if you lost your own. I was able to discern the acts and decisions made by each character, particularly Gi-hun. Gi-hun was an incredible and inspirational main character since he possessed the purest soul. I worry that if someone else had triumphed, they would not have made an effort to assist the other characters families unlike Gi-hun as he had promised. Because of his true goodness, the show is much more tolerable to watch.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for a second season.I really liked the characters and became invested in them.A few things I didn't like was I wished they focused more on the games. A lot of the episodes focused on the characters.I also wish the main character put his daughter first. That was a bit annoying to see because I like his character.I still don't understand the point of the games and offering the money. I wish it had been explained better. Seemed like they tried to and I still don't get it.But other than those things it was enjoyable and very unique. I was on the edge of my seat so many times and I had to remind myself it's only tv.There are a few twists in it too if you like twists like I do.Highly recommend it.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending?

To be honest I loved this series. The littoe details were awesome and the whole idea is really clever. This series made me laugh and cry. I don't normally like series like this but this was just amazing masterpiece with many plotwists. The best series that I have watched for a while. I recommend this to you all.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I have been a fan of Korean cinema for a long time. Thanks to Parasitie, Korean cinema has been deservedly been propelled.This show is the epitome of cinema from that part of the world. It is poigant, sad, violent, contains moral choices..it has it all. Throughly enjoyable. I do and don't want another season..it can easily be left where it ended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The atmosphere, plot, acting is very good and enjoyed a lot. Still, the American actors were so weird and felt like if the staff and director asked strangers in Korea if they could speak fluent English so they could act in the movie because it was really weird acting and the 69 jokes were really stupid, killed the vibe. Also, the unnecessary sex scene as in any other Netflix production felt really necessary to the plot.I guess that's Netflix or American culture to add sex scenes in any type of film & movie?",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"As a Korean-American who is a fan of cinema, Korean film and television still has a long way to go overall. There are a few standout directors (Bong Joon Ho and. Park Chan Wook immediately come to mind), but in general-as demonstrated in Squid Game-Korean cinema is prone to over-dramatization, reducing character to two dimensional caricatures, very obvious and amateur plot holes among other glaring faults that take away from the effect and value of the film. The plot is engaging to be sure, but the execution prevents me from feeling fully invested in the emotional turmoil of the characters.Decent series overall but not at all deserving of whatever hype it's received.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Good story and good caracter developpement
I like it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Idea of the movie was ok, my problem is that the acting is so bad (like amateur level) that i could not get behind any of protagonists. If the serie would have ended after the first episode i could not care less. I'm not gonna watch any continuation of this series in the future.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Was a good watch the first 3 episodes. Then I got bored and then it picked up again only to be ruined by the finale. I hated the ending. Gi-hun went back to being a loser and just forgot about his daughter for a year? I get guilt but damn I was hoping he would've at least changed his life. The old man was behind everything..okay but i didn't really care for this reveal. It didn't do anything. I wish we learned more about the Frontman and his brother. He just shoots him and that's the end of it. All in all, it was just alright. Episodes were too long and dragged out.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I watched most of the series the back stories of the main characters were interesting. Some of the games, such as ""Red light, green light"" were, for me, way too violent and the violence way, way too graphic. I wish the series would have in some way revealed who the organizers of the ""games"" were and what purpose they had in staging the games, other than offering people in deep financial trouble a way to pay their debts. I wish the creators of the series would depicted the violence a little less graphic and disturbing. Maybe leaving the consequences of losing a gaming to the viewers' imagination. Violence and bloodletting aside, the series was good in a dark way. I can't say that I ""enjoyed"" the series, it was, however, interesting and a bit fascinating. The overall story I give it a 9 out 10, for the graphic violence a 4 out 10 too disturbing for my taste.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It started out promising; I thought it would be a different touch to the topics that we have already seen in other movies: hunger games, the game, maze, the exam etc. But it never got to the point where all the violence makes sense. Characters do not make sense, scenario do not build up to something meaningful. All that mysterious show-business-kind-of costumes and staging lose their effect when the plot is unable to deliver a meaningful explanation. In each episode until the last scene, I expected a twist or some progress so that I could appreciate all the hype but nope. It did not happen. If the message was injustice and humans gotta make their way with it, that's been done countless times and sorry, this didn't sell it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I loved 067 and her friend most

and it contains a lot of violence so its not recommended for family.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This film is great, it deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. Apart from Squid games, there are many other survival games genre films, but what distinguishes Squid Game from other films of the same genre is that it departs from the real reality of human life. People in debt look for all kinds of ways to pay off their debts, even if they risk their lives. Meanwhile, among the rich, the struggle of the poor becomes entertainment for those who are tired of a life that is always fulfilled. This reality is sad, but this is what actually happened.In the end, when the 456th player has won the first prize and the billions of prizes, he does not find happiness because he has sacrificed the lives of his friends. Money becomes meaningless and his life is not like it used to be.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, ""Hell"", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"First it looked very exciting and fresh content for netflix shows, the first game was amazing but then the following games were quite boring except game 4. The stories about characters were SO BORING, i could not watch most of the storylines about them. The lines were too long and boring and unrelated as well. Police thing was very exciting but then what? He killed by his brother who is the manager of the games(!) and nothing clarified?? Who is he? Why is he the manager of the games? As a watcher, it did not give me the answers so it was a wasted storyline too. And i do not even wanna talk about VIPs and their lines...they were horrible. And the ending, why did you go back? What about your beloved daughter?what about your promises?Besides all of these bad comments, it was a unique show and some scenes were very exciting than i could not even blink. So if you wanna have some disturbingly beautiful and at the same time some boringness you can watch it :)",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I rarely watch non-American TV shows or movies but the plot of this show just pulled me right in to watch it. Phenomenal acting, great cliffhangers, and very emotional near the end of the season! I REALLY hope the second season starts up soon!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The concept carries the film. It's really interesting, but unfortunately the player interactions are sooo cliche and corny. They're like the last seasons of the Walking Dead, for those that have seen them. The ending game especially was just so bad. They tried to establish ambiguity about the main character's ethos in the first episode, but it all goes out the window and he becomes just 100% angelic good guy, which is frustrating and annoying to watch.I still enjoyed it, I suppose, but with each episode I liked it less and less. It's fine to entertain yourself for a week but it isn't something to come back to.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Fantastically haunting soundtrack.Rich character development that leads to you having a connection with all of the lead roles.Iconic costumes and a horrifying and thought provoking plot.This should would have gotten a 10 of if wasnt for episodes 7 and 9.(SPOILER ALERT)
X - episode 7 - the VIP's were absolutely horribly cast and they needed a stronger script. I completely understand what they were trying to achieve but literally every line that came out of any of their mouths was cringe worthy in delivery. It took away from an otherwise outstanding episode.X - episode 9 - Everyone loved the relationship of old mate and the lead character. The final ep really took away from that connection. I am a fan of twists but this one just didnt seem believable for me. The character was just too different to be credible.X - red hair was pointless
X - Not getting on the plane felt like a stretch from the leads character. Lets just hope he doesnt go full John Wick in season 2 or its just too far from everything that was great in 7 of the 9 eps.Its hard to give above an 8 when the vips and old mate twist was just one cringe too far.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I really loved the first few episodes, but soon the magic started waning for me. There were too many predictable and pointless subplots, and the level of melodrama started to get too high for my taste. Also, there were a couple of outrageously homophobic moments.All in all; the show was okay and I somewhat enjoyed it, but expected much more based on all the hype.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It's hard to understand the killing by numbers appeal - it's expressive and shocking and bizarre, but mass-murder is mass-murder. Whatever the plot, it's just unnecessary and fairly uninventive after first shot - once you understand the game rules and one person breaks them and gets shot, the rest is the same dull murderous routine for another 5 minutes.At the same time it's hard to sympathise thieves and gamblers - their lifestyle is by no means a death verdict, but they're not a relatable bunch either. Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they're wearing the masks.Cinematography good though, and maybe there's a great reveal up ahead - but I'm very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Not gonna lie it did take me awhile to watch this show. But I gotta say. It was great. I actually really enjoyed it. I surprisingly liked a lot of the characters. I thought it was fun. I was infested in the story. Episode 2 did feel a little pointless. The last episode was probably my favorite. And yeah a great show that definitely deserves a second season.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Pretty well done, This series is heavily inspired by the anime Kaiji.If you like this series, you should give it a try the anime version, which is kinda old but good!Story is great, actors are average but story covers for them!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Although this serie is definitely not perfect I loved it! Interesting concept and loved the games. I would have rated this higher based on my favorite scenes: the first 3 games and the main characters were perfect! But some parts ruined a higher score: The VIPS were terrible, the story of the police officer did not add that much and I did not like the glass game. But overall: go watch this.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I was skeptical of the show since it had so much hype, but it was an amazing show by far. This show will keep you entertained almost the whole way through. The only part i wish wasn't in it was the vips they contributed nothing imo. Other than that this show was the bomb.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"I watched two episodes and I had enough. There's nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I've seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series). I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show. I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion. If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I saw this while scrolling on Netflix and noticed it was trending on Twitter & such so I checked it out not fully knowing what to expect. This show is crazy....in a good way! Although some of the concepts and choices here have somewhat been done before it doesn't matter because I've never had an experience before, like I did with this show. Anytime a show/ movie can offer that experience it deserves recognition. Still not sure how to feel about the ending but this is definitely an awesome series. Also I would recommend watching this with the Korean dialogue and English subtitles, it feels more natural and you can hear the real actors performance this way.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"There is a reason why this show got the attention it has gotten. Because of the attention to details. There is no lazing writing in here, at all. There is tension and suspense that never ends. Hours of effort, meticulous writing and creating obviously went into every minute of this show, which is why it shines. Above all, the show makes you question human nature, and opens your mind to questions you may have never asked before.Every once in a thousand shows you get that ONE !I wish every creative writer makes at least half the effort that went into this show, because the truth is, shows like Squid Game, GoT, Breaking Bad, Money Heist are every once in a while kind of shows. They have their own special category because of the obvious effort that goes towards their creation and writing.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
The way the last episode did is similar to Game of Thrones' last few seasons. It was just a dumb ending. He could have boarded the plane and it would have ended right then there. And the hair colour..just wtf.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Rating: 8This show was identical to Money Heist in so many ways. The costumes, the plot, the way how people tackle situations and obviously Netflix. Squid Game seems like Money Heist of an alternate darker reality. But I enjoyed it. I hope the series does not get milked much. The acting performances were good, I liked how the games were simple yet ingenious.This series, I believe took heavy influence from old movies like Cube and Exam. Exam is a really underrated flick and I could sense the influence in the finale.I believe you can give it a watch and climb the hype train. It has comedy, gore, tragedy etc a complete package but it's not a must watch. I think it will get renewed for a Season 2 but after the finale something felt amiss hence I am giving it an 8. Probably because I have seen Money Heist, Exam, Cube, Saw etc hence I didn't find the plot as completely new and offbeat.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

There was quite a buzz around Squid Game over the last few weeks. There was positive as well as negative buzz regarding the violence.After watching through the show in the last 3 days I can say that the show is interesting in some aspects but has issues in others.The acting ranges from good to outrageously bad for some of the characters. The sound and visuals are pretty solid.When it comes down to the writing it's a bit of a rollercoaster as there are good and bad things there as well. I didn't really like the characters and some of the games presented were poorly thought out in terms of the rules and the characters didn't notice these issues which then made them act stupid.The ending of season 1 is rather open and like with many shows leaves room for a season 2. The question is whether or not they can make season 2 also interesting because I think we have seen the best twists the show has to offer in the first season.Also looking at the shows as a whole I can get behind the message it tries to deliver even with the problems.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Sadly and stupidly I watched every episode.Easily predictable on what happens and who's who.The acting is woeful with even worse dubbing. If I can remember who recommended this to me, i'd throw them in the stupid game myself for wasting 9 hours of my life on utter dross.It's not unique it's not different. It's all been done before or similar and there is zero suspense or surpriseIf I can save just one single soul from watching this my job is done.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"So I loved it, got very addicted to it and watched it in 2 days (could of done it in a day but I'm a working adult). I was very much into it through it all until the 5th game and onwards... the 5th game was just a bit of a mess and we all knew who was going to end up getting through. Then the last 2 episodes turned into quite a confusion when 2 of the leads die and then the main characters goes off into the world with obvious PTSD and a huge bank account. Rewind a year and he goes to meet the old man who is still alive (no shock there) and then he dies... cool story. Then he has some sort of middle aged mental breakdown, dyes his hair red, managed to break the girls brother out of a kids home and adopt him to the other guys mum and then finds out squid game is still going and goes all dolally. All in all... is there a season 2?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"Squid game offers everything you can ask for in a guilty pleasure gore filled thriller. They also take their time to really flush out the characters even with such a diverse cast, highlighting all aspects of humanity that would expect to see in a game of life and death.With a 9 episode run for this 1st season it's a great weekend binge show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I'm glad I didn't. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they're very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"It is quite hard to review the whole series . Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture.

The series starts with a thrilling aspect and with great actors presenting an unforgettable perfomance. The ending could be a potential for season 2 but it couldve been better.

"I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I committed a whole day in front of this show but it really caught me. Episode 6 had me bawling my eyes out. However, I feel like the last episode was a little disappointed. They tried to make you understand that you won't find happiness in money, but I just feel like the pace and the vibe were a bit off compared to the rest of the show. And such a shame to learn that the character whose ""death"" you mourned the most showed to be the evil guy all along.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The South Korean film Parasite should've gotten the same amount of hype this show received. First off cringe worthy costume designs they looked too basic, childish, and uncreative. The story had real world implications but felt like a weird lazy rip off of the movie saw with weak writing. It got so predictable and dull I didn't even watch the last two episodes.

"I recently watched the famous Korean series ""Squid Game,"" which has become one of the most viewed shows globally. It is undeniably captivating-perhaps the best way to describe it.The series is known for its intense violence and brutal killings, creating an atmosphere that is both repulsive and irresistible. The more I heard about it, the less inclined I was to watch it. However, once I started, I couldn't tear myself away.Written by Hwang Dong-hyuk in 2008, the script remained unnoticed until Netflix prepared it for release in 2021. The series delves into the war between poverty and wealth, the conflict of capitalism and hunger, and the struggle of the faceless against the affluent. It paints a harrowing picture of humanity in a world dominated by wealth and money.The Korean language adds a unique flavor to the narrative, enhancing the overall experience.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"The film making, characters, acting and premise was absolutely brilliant.I did find myself rolling my eyes more times than I'd hoped as characters made completely illogical decisions (I'm looking at you Ali) which conveniently fit the plot. I feel like it was cheap story telling that the writers thought the viewer wouldn't notice.The voice actors for the VIP's were horrific but hey it is a Korean series.Overall I'd give a 7.8.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"To many similarities with The Hunger Games. The contestants do have a choice whether to participate, though.Too many plotholes as well.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
Great to watch this series. The story was gripping and the acting was exciting... except for the VIPs who came in the last couple of episode. They could have done better.At times I felt that dialogues were a bit too long but you have to complete the time slot. The lead actors were great in their roles.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"This show is good. Like really efing good. It has an interesting premise, though if not wholly original, complex characters played by (mostly) talented actors, well thought out themes and was superbly shot. The high stakes and gradual reveal of mysteries doesn't let you have a single minute of boredom. The characters' constant exposure to mortal danger gives you a thrilling worry to which character might die next keeping you glued to the screen.All that being said, I'm not sure if it deserves all the hype surrounding it. The show is great, but there are so many other shows that are just as good or better yet are barely discussed outside of hardcore fans. If you go in expecting to watch one of the greatest shows of all time, then there is a good chance you'll be disappointed.Whatever feelings it might entice: be it overwhelming joy for having found a good show in these trying times when our so called ""entertainment"" is excruciatingly painful to watch or a big disappointment for it not meeting your expectations, one thing is for sure, you'll never relax by ""The Blue Danube"" ever again.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
"""Squid Game"" is a gripping South Korean survival drama series that has taken the world by storm. Set in a dystopian society, the show follows a group of financially desperate individuals who find themselves drawn into a mysterious and deadly competition known as the ""Squid Game."" The participants, facing overwhelming debt and hardships in their lives, compete in a series of sinister and childhood-inspired games with a huge cash prize awaiting the sole survivor.The series delves deep into themes of desperation, human nature, and the lengths people are willing to go to for a chance at redemption and financial freedom. Each character's background is intricately explored, highlighting their struggles, motivations, and personal demons. As the games progress, alliances form, betrayals occur, and moral dilemmas arise, pushing the contestants to their physical and emotional limits.What makes ""Squid Game"" stand out is its thought-provoking storytelling, intense suspense, and thoughtfully crafted characters.

The contestant population is shaved down daily and winners develop complex relationships with their fellow survivors, running the gamut from helping each other stay alive to killing one another. Life is very iffy: one's closest companion may kick them into a pit. This program pulled me right in - I was immediately permeated with ""what would I do?"" emotions.

"This film try too hard to be another Parasite but fail in many way.About the battle royale, main character is way too useless from the beginning to the end. He contributed almost nothing to the game. His arc is just too simple, nothing significant changed. The games are designed simple and pure by chance most of them. It required nothing smart or outstanding physical.The VIP and bad guys are stupid as heck. Who write those characters ?The plot twist is not that twist anymore since you can easily guess it. Who haven't seen that classic horror movie franchise ?There are a lot of better movies out there in battle royale or social issues.

The craze that the K-drama holds in worldwide it was only a matter of time to bang.All the hype, thrills and excitements aside, it is actually a pretty much predictable show where anyone with a common knowledge can predict it's final outcome correctly. You will be lying if you say you didn't see who is going to be the ultimate winner after just watching the pilot episode.The best thing about the show were those eventful journey, each and every round of the game were made with all possible thrills but yet again the ultimate results were some easy guess, it is what killed the core suspense of the show. However it doesn't decrease the addiction of finishing it overnight cause it had that ultimate Korean flavours.

"With Parasite Korean things ruined by Every Director. They are ""Hollywood Kids"". Everything after ""Swiri"" Korean contends are shadow of American Movies and TV Show. I mean Not a story(some story too) film making. Everything is same. Lighting, editing, camera angles, everything is exactly same. Parasite is the worst result. So Oscar member think it's an American film so it got Oscar with lobby. Squid game is same. Have anyone saw John Woo's 90's movie?? Slow motions are so same I can't tell the which is which. Before mid 90s Korean Movie had very unique. Every director had different film making style. Now?? Nothing but Hollywood film making. I'm so sad Korean contents are just little Hollywood. After chaebul like CJ or Lotte make movie. It just product. Not an art anymore. But nobody cares I'm very sad.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"As a fervent enthusiast of innovative storytelling, ""Squid Game"" left an indelible mark on me. This South Korean masterpiece transcends conventional boundaries, delivering a visceral and thought-provoking exploration of human nature and societal constructs.The series intricately weaves together themes of desperation, morality, and the relentless pursuit of survival within the framework of deadly children's games. From the gripping character arcs to the meticulously crafted set designs, every aspect of ""Squid Game"" is executed with precision and artistry.What truly sets ""Squid Game"" apart is its ability to immerse viewers in a world that is both eerily familiar and chillingly dystopian. Through its stark commentary on class disparity and the commodification of human life, the series compels audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about society's insatiable hunger for power and wealth.Moreover, the ensemble cast delivers powerhouse performances that resonate long after the credits roll. Each character is fleshed out with complexity and depth, evoking empathy and intrigue in equal measure.In conclusion, ""Squid Game"" is a tour de force that demands to be experienced. It challenges the viewer to reflect on the fragile nature of humanity while delivering a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

"Sweet Home stands as a gripping testament to the power of the horror genre in Korean television, weaving a tale that is equal parts heart-wrenching and terrifying. With its intricate storytelling, well-developed characters, and stunning visuals, the series takes us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions while exploring the very essence of humanity in the face of monstrous adversity.Explores the complexities of human nature under extreme circumstances. The narrative unfolds as reclusive loner Cha Hyun-soo, portrayed with remarkable depth by Song Kang, finds himself thrust into a nightmarish scenario when his apartment complex turns into a breeding ground for monstrous creatures. From the outset, the series establishes a foreboding atmosphere, intensified by the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that expertly complements the unfolding horror.Huge commitment to character development. As the residents of the apartment complex grapple with their worst fears manifesting into grotesque creatures, the series meticulously explores the humanity that persists within them. Each character is meticulously crafted, revealing layers of vulnerability, resilience, and darkness. Song Kang's portrayal of Cha Hyun-soo is a revelation, as he seamlessly transitions from a tormented soul to a reluctant hero, carrying the emotional weight of the narrative on his shoulders.The monsters aren't just physical entities; they are embodiments of the characters' inner demons. The creature design is both nightmarish and imaginative, adding a unique flavor to the horror genre. The CGI and practical effects are executed with such finesse that the monsters become an integral part of the narrative, heightening the stakes and intensifying the terror.The pacing of the series is commendable, balancing moments of intense horror with poignant character interactions. It doesn't rely solely on jump scares; instead, it crafts an atmosphere of dread that lingers, making every moment fraught with tension. The series isn't afraid to delve into psychological horror, exploring the darkest corners of the human mind as characters grapple with the consequences of their choices in the face of annihilation.Sweet Home also excels in its thematic exploration of survival and the blurred lines between humanity and monstrosity. It poses thought-provoking questions about the lengths individuals are willing to go to in order to survive, and the sacrifices they make along the way. The moral ambiguity of certain characters adds layers of complexity, making it challenging for us to pass easy judgments.Visually, the series is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the eerie beauty of the decaying apartment complex and the gruesome transformations of its inhabitants. The juxtaposition of moments of quiet despair with frenetic action sequences creates a dynamic viewing experience.The series doesn't shy away from addressing societal issues either. Amidst the horror, it explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the resilience of the human spirit. It reflects the anxieties of the real world through its fictional narrative, making it a socially relevant piece of storytelling.This one is a triumph in the horror genre, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in Korean television. It weaves a narrative that is as emotionally resonant as it is terrifying, with stellar performances, masterful storytelling, and a visual aesthetic that leaves a lasting impression. For those seeking a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche in the face of unimaginable horrors, Sweet Home is a must-watch that transcends the confines of its genre.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Atmosphere of the series is one of a kind in comparison with many horror series that I have seen before. It's giving the audience entire.

"Korean Drama 'Sweet Home' has awful CGI, but it makes up with the on-point atmosphere. The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline. The pace is also perfect for the action element of the story. Finally, the performances were all quite emotional.So, overall, 7 out of 10.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"The first season was pretty cool, it wasn't my favorite show by any means and i thought it had a lot of problems as far as just kinda odd cartoonish character moments, but thats the thing is some of its best moments could have been described that way too, but when that applied to the drama rather than the action and horror, it took me out of certain moments, where things just seemed a bit childish and melodramatic. Darkness for its own sake. Still, i thought it had a unique world and i like the weird noticeable CG monsters that don't try to hard to look perfectly real, i find them more visually interesting than monsters in plenty of other series or movies i'd consider better overall. So season 1 got a 6 from me, and im a rather harsh reviewer. Season 2 however, went down the drain VERY quickly. I can't even describe how much happened in this season that i didn't care about. I made it through 3-4 episodes because there were some interesting monsters that held my interest and a few interesting moments with main characters. Around there i realized there was suddenly just a LOT going on that i did not care about at all, and i just felt i had to skip some scenes to get through, it was all these military guys just being dicks to eachother, very boring. I basically fast forwarded through the last half and the end seemed frankly stupid to me. Other reviews i checked out agreed that this was mostly just chaotic pointless filler, its wild to me they filmed a whole other season already as well, because this is BAD. Skip this one.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"First of all, I want to say, both the ""perfect"" reviews and the ""abysmal"" reviews both miss the mark. This show is a great ""middle-of-the-road"" experience. It's concepts are great, and in the same breath, the writing is terrible in a way that is really entertaining to tease poking fun. The effects are awesome while the characters are hilariously aching anime/manga clich챕s. Great emotion with wafer-thin development, and so on and so forth. I would recommend you check it out, but go in with an attitude that this isn't one of those Netflix masterpiece offerings or absolute trash despite how much people want it to be one or the other.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I read the webcomic as it came out, and have loved it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a Netflix adaptation, I was skeptical, but excited to see what they decide to do with it. If you're like me, you'll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his 'monster' way more frequently. The adaptation should've more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don't exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it's a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn't here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn't get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I'm surprised they didn't include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I'm uncertain where they'll take this, but I'll keep my hopes up for now.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Non stop action, monsters, drama, and gore! This is a wonderful example of Korean creativeness and how far TV shows have come. I am starting to become a fan of Korean acting, especially in Sweet Home, where everyone has a story that slowly unfolds with each episode and nobody are who they seem. The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects. The latter episodes include a few more emotions and tears but the entertainment is still there -- you can't have all action and no back story for the entire season. All in all I really enjoyed it.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Sweet Home is nothing what I expected it to be. This got me holding on to the edge of my seat from the 1st episode until the last. The only real complaint I have is that it ended!

Nothing interesting happens. Nothing cool happens. For some reason the monsters now look like transformers.I just really can't believe how BAD this show has gotten in just 1 season.

I watched good Korean movies. But I didn't want to watch Korean series. But this was interesting. Is it super? Definitely not. But it was interesting. The acting and characters weren't bad, although there were very clich챕. If they had some money, I hope they'd change the cgi and music. The music choices were awful. They play irrelevant music on an irrelevant scenes. In general, I said it was not bad as a Korean series. I'll probably watch the next seasons as well.

"At first I want to say Season 1 was a good one, I know this series was bad at storytelling but I ignored it in season 1 because it was not causing that much problem, Season 1 was interesting till the end but I want to say that season 1 ending was somehow not fitting and I honestly say till the end I was not able to get what the rubbish is going in the Character's minds and ""what's their next move""(I know this Quality fits in crime thrillers, twisted plots but in this scenario, it is nothing more than time waste).Lets talk about Season 2,
Season 2 is like a garbage piling in our rooms but we are just not throwing it out and just watching it or ignoring it.Honestly saying Season 2 was rubbish, Very bad in storytelling, Please dont ask me about characters because for them there are only bad/cursed words in my mouth, talking about mail lead(one wing man) I want to say that just what is his character he has power but dont use it, keep standing and crying and literally do the foolishest things you and I will do if we get those powers. Frankly saying I was waiting the whole second season to watch him do something, my mind was saying that now is the time when he will make a god-like entry but I was foolish to think that I can expect anything good from NETFLIX and finally talking about female leadssssssssss(Sorry my mouth is getting out of control.....BAD WORDS INCOMING....)

"I actually really loved season 1 of Sweet Home , but this one was a little disappointing to me . I thought it would be better than S1 but it wasn't on my expectation. Like the characters from season 1 kept dying just to show new characters and what's sadly is they are weaker than those of S1. Too less shown of strong female characters of a real fighting with monsters. It was toooooo slow with action time . Just the army members fighting . Where are the people like on season one ? And lastly ... what's wrong with Cha hyun su screen time ? It was going fine in the beginning but then he disappeared for like 2-3 episodes not showing him at all. He has just a few lines and went from the special monster to a one of them and not even the strongest one as he should have been . The young girl took his place as now she is the biggest special one . I had hopes but I don't know how S3 is going to be . I only enjoyed the last episode of the whole new season, when finally the lead actor are on screen . I also loved those blue eyes while looking so hot at eun yoo as I really missed their interaction during S2. I pretty pleaseee put them more on screen. Song kang need to be there the most as the most important one .",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The show puts a lot of work into making you care about the diverse characters, but in the end I don't think it does them justice. Too many of them are just cast aside, or neglected for several episodes to the point that I forget who is who.As for the monsterfication stuff, it's way too wishy-washy. Could definitely do with some more concrete details. A lot of the time it seemed like people just throw up their hands and go 'well, I guess I'm a monster now'.7/10 Stars, some epic moments and really good special effects, but story meanders too much.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

I'm still stuck on episode two or three but I don't know if I should finish it. Im sort of lost in a sense,it doesn't make sense as to why theres so much military off the bat and it seems like the whole thing is Song Kang is being used as a lab rat from where I'm at. There's also already a bunch of new characters and some I like but some I dislike??Song kang is one of my favorite kdrama actors so i'll try and finish it but the second season isn't as appealing to me aa the first one was in my opinion.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"With some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI, it does create some disturbing scenes akin to Evil Dead. But the plot is sadly ruined by a lot of nonsensical moments actions & reactions that are clearly only there to create tension. It's also oddly like every actor went to the same acting school and acquired an annoying prolonged lifeless gaze look as their reaction to basically everything.... Wondering what to have for dinner? ( Stare longingly into the fridge). Watching your neighbour get devoured by a hideous demon (stare longingly into neighbours intestines). Saving your friends from certain death by simply closing a door ( stare longingly at door handle) it's relentlessly like this from start to finish.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Based on my research the comic series or webtoon etc... only covers the time in the apartment to their escape, with an ending of being in a military camp.My research is primarily from Wikipedia and the show is loosely based on those events in the first season.I didn't wish to ruin my experience of the show but by the end of the third episode in season two I simply couldn't watch it all. It's basically an entirely new show with a plethora of new characters with no background or development to them the few remaining characters from the first season are either dead or not a focal point, of the main plot which becomes focused on chaos and an autocratic military government and ""civilian"" morons most of whom totally new as I mentioned.I'd personally stop watching by the end of one though it leaves on somewhat of a cliffhanger that basically crashes.Season 2 the episodes are not only fragmented without character development they are 20-30 minutes longer than season 1.I advise this for nearly all programs good or bad to watch in the native language (Korean) and the subtitles. The voice over acting I can only definitively say in English is horrible.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Only a few times I thought it was moving slow, but it seemed to pick up the pace in other places. The character development for some was very good, the ending spectacular!

"Man, this show was something, I definitely recommend it to every horror fan out there. It's a fresh take on the tired zombie-siege formula with a great set of characters, great performances ans most importantly fantastic monster designs used in creative set-pieces.If I would have rated this after the first 3 episodes, this would have been an easy 9, unfortunately the show can't keep the pace and sharp writing of it's opening up and deflates to an extend. The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn't have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.
Also rules are very inconsistent, first it's a big deal that monsters can't be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Updated review after finishing watching season 2. I thought it was one of the saddest yet beautiful shows I've ever watched, there was a lot of tear jerking moments for me and I'm not someone who gets emotional often. The story is basically people are turning into random monsters and follow a group of survivors in an apartment building. I would say it falls under horror but there is some light humour thrown in as well. There is good deal of drama in the mix, a couple of times I did actually cry something I don't do often. It is very well acted the story is great so far and there is a good balance of action and character building. I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good. The one negative i have is on the most part the effects are good but the CGI is great in places and then terrible in others. But I can't recommend this enough, now that being said season 2 just seems to be lacking something, I'm assuming it written by a different team because it just isn't as good it seems to swing more towards intense action with monster in it. They kill off characters we came to enjoy in the first season because you know why not? And introduce a bunch of new characters that take up the majority of the screen time after the first 3 episodes, im assuming they did this to speed up production, but it just takes the focus away from the characters that they have built a good amount of character development up with, (the few that are left from season 1) It's still some what enjoyable however I just feel the writing has let it down hopefully it will pick up in season 3.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"Season 1 was interesting, but Season 2 is awful. The plot of Season 2 in incomprehensible. There are a lot of plot holes left from Season 1. Season 1 seemed to be taking you in one direction and Season 2 seems to have no direction at all. Most of the new characters are grating and unwatchable. Much of the acting is poorly done. And as is usual with Netflix, the dubbing is really bad. I don't know why Netflix keeps choosing the same voice actors, because they are awful and they make it really difficult to watch foreign films. Watch it in the original language and read subtitles. The concept is interesting. It could've been really good but execution is not great.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Season one was one of the most creative horror shows going. You never knew what the next monster would be and each one was unique based on the whole monsterization curse.Everything a new one showed up itnwas exciting to see what it could do.All of the characters where well thought out and you got a good sense of who they where as it went on.Season 2 is not bad but feels like a completely different show. The first part follows the original group and is really tense even has a shock moment. All leading up to the frankly epic stadium moment.Then it jumps forwardHalf the original characters are gone and apart from a couple of standouts the monsters have all become generic CGI blobs.One scene with the army group fighting a horde with cut and paste versions if the same monster took everything away from the unquie ideas.It mostly revolves around said army groups squabbles and chest beating. Meanwhile a monster subplot is there but again very slow and not that much monster going on.Its still good and will keep watching but I want my monsters as advertised.,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"They should stick to 16 episodes rather than 10 episodes.
Every thing happens very fast and rushed.
May be that's why Netflix didn't put dubbed version out",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"OK, I am going to start by saying that I'm a huge horror fan so this series really caught my attention. From start to finish it was a Rollercoaster of creepiness, scares, emotions and awesome character development. Never got boring for even a second and the monsters are really cool and deep if you are paying good attention to the story. Most monsters in horror movies don't even make much sense but in this series it does make sense. Because I got pretty tired of horror movies with the classic its just a bunch of meaningless jumpscares and enemies that are just there to fill the plot. No more blubbering. Go watch this series right now and you won't regret it. Excited for season 2 and what is has to offer! (Also I had to give it 9/10, - 1 because of some fight scenes being a little rushed. But still, a series definitely worth watching!)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I was so impressed with the first couple of episodes!
Didn't expect anything and loved the wierd, quirky residents of the building. And then the monster came - and man are they awesome!! Totally could see it as a video game ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill.
BUT around half way through it felt like they had fired all their good shots - less monsters, and mainly people sitting around /talking /crying or fighting each other. (maybe they were out of budget?!)
10* for the first half and 5-6* for the second.All together still very watchable",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I had second thoughts about starting it but after the first two episodes it just got better and better. I do think that Asian horror series and movies are kind of too much about their ""horror scenes"" but this isn't the case here. Although it has some scenes to prove its theme there isn't much attention paid to them. I really liked the plot and I loved the different details and personas of every character. The whole series is fascinating and keeps you on edge all the time. It's like every episode ends with a cliffhanger. The background stories of the characters are very interesting and I liked how the series although it has a dark theme it pays much attention to the relationships and emotions among humans. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes horror-action series.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Despite the all over the place story & occasionally terrible special effects, this is yet another fab Korean series. They really have got the horror market sewn up!",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This show caught me immediately when I watched the first season a few years ago. I found the concept unique and fascinating, and the focus on a tight knit community and their personal struggles gave each encounter with the mysterious horrors they were facing a sense of weight and gravitas. These initial episodes were beautifully paced, giving each character's personality time to shine, and giving plenty of moments of heartfelt levity to balance the brutality. Throughout the course of the season, I grew to know each of the characters and care about what happened to them. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about season 2, and even rewatched all of season 1 when it came out, in order to refresh my memory. The shift in tone between seasons was immediately evident. Gone was the thoughtful, character-centric storytelling, in favor of over the top action sequences full of bland monsters, countless non descript soldiers with big guns and flame throwers, car chases that would be at home in a Vin Deisel movie, and plenty of uninteresting new characters that never show much more personality than a wet paper sack.Even the season 1 characters lost their personality this season. There was nothing to distinguish them from the faceless mobs around them, and no moment to breathe with them and get to know them on a deeper level. It was simply a rush from one disaster to another, with nothing in between except some screaming and sobbing. Even when they killed off some of my favorite characters in cheap and unsatisfying ways, I found that I didn't really feel anything. They just didn't even seem like the same people I had gotten to know in the first season.I really wanted to like season 2. I tried very hard to. The storytelling was simply half baked and didn't give the audience a chance to connect with the charcters before sending them into disaster after disaster. Season 1 seemed to grasp that the bad stuff hits way harder when there's some good stuff and human connection mixed in. I wish the writers of Season 2 had picked up on that, and I really hope that Season 3 fixes that mistake.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I watched this on Netflix with subtitles and the original dialogue. I can't comment on dubbing other than don't use it for anything, ever.It's an interesting take on the zombie/monster genre. But if you get interested by the first few episodes you might later regret feeling the need to stick through and see how it ends. By the last few episodes I was losing interest. Several characters are intolerable. Some likable characters are sidelined. Some events are over the top to the point that it's frustrating. It sometimes goes too far on pointless shock value, and other times not far enough. It's not a terrible show if you're looking for monster/horror/apocalypse/survival, but I found it getting old by the end.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"*First*
Most of reviews here do not do justice to this show. The story is great, the character development is also compelling and really amazing CGI and visual effects.*Second*
Story is gripping and it's a roller coaster ride. This show will make you go through lots of emotions. This show gives me the anime *Parasyte* vibe.*Third*
Give this show a chance and watch it all the way it's a great one. Not in a single episode it felt like the show was dragging or was adding unnecessary fillers or anything unrelated to the story.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The idea of this series is great. Instead of zombies you get people turning into these crazy monsters. First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn't the usual stuff. It's like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough. I'm not sure how adding a season 2 would go with so many good characters now gone. At least for me everybody I liked was dead at the end so there was no point to watching the story further. I guess it really did hit a walking dead point.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"As a Webtoon long time fan, I just had to watch this, and I can say, I am not disappointed. Characters are just amazing, great representation of human interaction in specific horrifying circumstances, lovely depiction of fight from average, normal people you could likely meet anywhere, great action, fun, there is also a lot of humor, and the story is just amazing. It has horror, sf and comedy elements, but it also has deeper meaning, much more than surface deep horror, it makes you think. There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight. Granted, CGI effects are not much, as production does not seem expensive, but I still loved it, because all CGI is in function of the story, not just to shock you.Also, soundtrack is getting great along with the story.I would recommend it, and I am waiting for second season!Update: don't watch the second season, it just ruins the first one. First one is 10, second is like 3. Not good. Could be completely different series like spin-off, but then I wouldn't watch it.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"First of all, watch it with subtitles because dubbing is terrible and original language is always best. I watched the first episode because I got bored and love these types of shows, then found myself 5 episodes in and really liking it. I would rate the first half of this show a high 8/10 even with some sketchy CGI and over acting. The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it's more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it's not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won't say more. The CGI is sometimes great, then goes totally flat and looks absolutely horrible. Overall, this is a very enjoyable show to watch with a very unique premise behind it. I look forward to season 2 should they make one.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Great show, so much fun, and just like wtf!! Completely engaged from episode one and until the end. Fantastic adaption from the comics. Korean sci-fi and/or is my new favorite thing!",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Starts off well, and falls apart very quickly. The beginning was very well paced and even the CGI was pretty good. Then after a couple promising episodes in the show stops making sense and becomes a string of random plot lines and awkward emotional scenes where characters just stare at each other and cry, most of the time for no reason other than to kill time (this could have been 4 or 5 episodes instead, with fewer characters).
Eventually character development and motivations just fall apart and it becomes a mystery why anything happens or any character does anything.
Also a lot of seemingly important things happen that are never addressed again.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"A directorial masterpiece, excitement and suspense, a narration of events in an interesting way, far from boredom, the interconnectedness of events and interests",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I found this series through the manhua based on it and was shocked when I found out that it was produced and created, I didn't expect something like Sweet Home to get a Live Action release when not even an animation of it had been done.And I like it, shockingly enough.Usually Live Action adaptions of works in manga/manhua/comic/book form these days I have a visceral dislike for as they're usually terrible, but this adapts part of the story well.Lets get to the deets tho, the actors are fine, they're usually as believable as possible for what they are playing though some of it comes across as a little hammy to my uncultured Western ears, it might be decent for Korean TV/Movies but I wouldn't know, this is literally the first piece of Live Action Korean cinema I've seen and like I said I like it. (well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn't give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it's a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there's a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it's a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they're zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That's what drew me to the series in the first place and it's a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn't 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they'd let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it's fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don't speak Korean, the VA's in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"As a sweet home fan since literally the start of season 1 i was so disappointed watching season 2, the plot completely went off the rails after episode 3 and so many main characters from season 1 were killed off like they were nothing. First of all the dude from season 1 that turned into a monster on the bus in season 2 that killed the girl, that was honestly the start of the downfall as they gave character to season 1 and were killed off in season 2 like they were nothing. And don't get me started on Ji-su who was unrightfully killed in episode 3, not even to a monster but some rocks, she was one of the best characters too and practically made ""sweet home"" but died like a side character. Also, the plot was basically just filled with new irrelevant characters and overruled by the military. They also gave the MAIN character hyun-soo, who is literally on their poster, less screen time than some of the military men. And the season 2 monsters cannot even compare to the a season 1 monsters, the s2 monsters were shown with practically zombie characteristics whereas in season 1, basically every of the monsters had a storyline as to how they became a monster and what their desire was. Talking about ji-soo again (can you see my frustration) she and the other OG characters who carried the whole of season 1 were killed so fast when they developed so much depth into season 1. And to finish off my rant, the plot was horrible i'm sorry but half of the time i didn't even know what was going on because all that it was, was talking about military and that's about all i got from it, at one point i thought i was watching a war movie. Unless they bring back ji-soo somehow because of the fact that her body was never really shown, i don't see how sweet home season 3 can pull through and impress me like season 1 did. Bring Ji-Soo back.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"A novel take on the zombie apocalypse genre where the 'zombies' have superpowers. The star of the show is the set design and cinematography as it really brings you in to the show's world.I do wish the show had explored some deeper themes that were ripe for the taking. The 'curse' is brought on by human desire, but how and why?Acting is generally good even as the characters are mostly one dimensional. Character depth is mostly attempted via flashbacks and death scenes. Editing is choppy and it can be hard to figure out what's going on at times.Nevertheless Sweet Home is worth the watch. Hoping that Netflix produces a season 2.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

In a building besieged by humans who have turned into monsters which take the form of their hidden desires a group of people join forces to survive.

"This series is amazing... Needs season 2...
This is just a different type of horror show. There are know comparisons.
I'm in the UK... It was dubbed but the dubbing was done so well I actually forgot it was dubbed.. Worth a watch right to the end..",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The first few episodes of the show had me completely invested in it. From episode 7 onwards, it lost me. The writing is just too inconsistent. Far too much time is spent on characters introspection, and not enough spent reinforcing the world the writers are trying to build.I Googled a few questions I had about the show and came across post after post - from those who have read the web comic - lamenting the fact that certain information wasn't included in the show, and questioning why background information was included. I have to agree with them. Far too much time is spent showing us flashbacks. We don't need ""origin"" stories as the characters are already in a dire situation that's going to change their personality going forward. What we need are explanations of why certain events are happening now, why certain monsters seemingly appear from nowhere and a bit more time spent showing us character interactions in the here-and-now.The soundtrack is good. Unlike some, I also really like the CGI. Yes, it's cheap but it's well done and the style appeals to me. Some of the early monsters are reminiscent of those glimpsed in old films like Beetlejuice.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I would give the show am 8 but it is slightly hindered by its odd musical choices and bad cgi (the practical effects are wonderfully done however). I can forgive the bad cgi since I imagine this was not the biggest budget show, however the odd sometimes inane musical choices really throw the feeling off and sound design (which encompasses music)is essential in film and television.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'm really trying to wrap my head as to what happened here. Season one was a blast, lots of action kept you glued to the screen the actors and actresses in the series were fighting for their survival and towards the end they were rescued and you thought that this would get even better. Season 2 went completely sideways. Nothing really related to season 1 mostly soldiers and people I haven't seen in season 1 and very few things that kept me interested. I had a hard time watching the 8 episodes of season 2 as it was really that bad. Season 1 on the other hand I was able to binge watch it in 2 days. Supposedly there is to be a season 3 or a continuation of season 2 I really don't know. I hope that this gets better as Netflix took a promising series and pretty much flushed it down the toilet with season 2.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This is a pretty solid horror show and an interesting premise at that. Rather than just a straight up infection turning people into monsters, the nature of what is turning people into monsters is left intentionally vague, though it is affected by the type of person. There is a lot of human drama and issues dealing with surviving in an enclosed area with limited resources. The actors/actresses are good for the most part, though there is a disconnect where some characters are super emotive and over the top and others and barely responsive given the situation. The one thing that I thought could have been better were the effects. While I understand that it is a lower-budget show, it's just that a lot of the CG, especially the monsters, felt out of place. Some of the CG looks pretty good, other CG not so much, but it just doesn't really mesh well together. If all the CG was low-budget but had a more consistent art style and direction I think it would have been alot better. Still, a pretty good show.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"""It's not a disease; it's a curse."" And the series is not a horror story, though it is, but an allegory. And it is beautiful, frightening, tragic, compassionate.......and brilliant.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This is one fascinating watch. The show is entirely carried by its strong premise: a band of survivors hunkers down in an apartment complex while the people outside are turning into monsters.There are a couple things to like: the monsters are truly gross and grotesque and the animations are surprisingly good for a TV show. Cinematography and the use of colors can be quite beautiful, and some characters are quite interesting (albeit they are in the minority).Here's what I don't like and why I would not recommend this show: scenes are drawn out with people just staring into nothingness, and the show tries to cheaply evoke emotions in melodramatic ways like overtly and unduly zooming in on distressed people's faces. People often don't react to or even acknowledge the things that are happening around them, which at times results in truly jarring situations that do not make any sense at all. Also, there is a serious problem with editing. Sometimes there is almost no context to what is happening on screen, like a plan carried out that was not discussed beforehand, making the viewer guessing in a frustrating way.At the end of the day, I do enjoy watching Sweet Home, because this show is unlike any other show I've seen before. But you have to be willing to embrace the bizareness of it all.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I really love this series so far the monsters are creepy and very frightening in the whole plot is just awesome. You have to check it out you have to see it to believe it. Best Asian horror series I've seen in a long long time.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Thanks to netflix now we see more animes and mangas. Sweet home is actually a mahwa (korean comic series, manga is japanese) so in tv series acting of the some characters are may look exaggerated but compare to the japanese tv series adapted from animes (e.g. Alice in Borderland) this show has much better actings. Overall it is fun to watch, good for spending your quarantine time.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"It was great and satisfying, but unfortunately, Netflix and American film companies make movies and series without an end. Sometimes they don't make the continuation of movies and series at all. Sometimes they make with a lot of delay. I hate and am dissatisfied with the production of content that does not have a clear end. Netflix and the like make fun of the viewers and waste their time and money. Korean movie networks are doing better. Although Netflix and similar companies have more experience and facilities, they make almost all movies and series with an uncertain and ambiguous ending. They keep the viewers in an excruciating wait with uncertain timing. Now it is not clear if the continuation of this series will be made or when it will be made. I hope the whole world will boycott Netflix and similar companies.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This is definitely worth a watch . It's entertaining and good fun! I like the fact as it's dubbed into English so I don't have to read those pesky subtitles . Some people state that they prefer the subtitles but the translation isn't very good anyway ( as often it doesn't make sense ) so imo it's better to have the dubbing .( You also miss people's expressions and the action because you're too busy reading the subs!)
Apart from that , it's a good watch!",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I feel in love with the characters, I felt every part of there acting. It's not all gruesome but it does have it moments that are icky. There's only one thing I would change but it was unique that they played out the scene that way. I'm sure you'll catch it too. I'm on episode 9 and I loved the show so much I had to leave a review. I don't want it to end luckily there's a season 2 coming. I've been waiting too long to start season 1 partly because i would try watching it at night and it can get scary/thrilling. I regretted that it took me so long an episode in. Don't blink though you might miss something lol.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

At times the plot, actions and motivation of the characters are incomprehensible but it does eventually manage to develop a theme everyone an understand.The Monsters, although they play less and less of a role are outstandingly doneJust watch and enjoy it. Its not a western show and that's what makes it different and fresh",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I absolutely adored the first season, I've watched it many times. I've waited years and was so excited for season 2. Before season 2, I would have rated this show a 9/10. So what the heck happened? It felt like a completely different show. The style, the pacing, the direction, the acting, everything felt different. There was far too little of the original cast, and none of the new cast were interesting. There was no direction, it was all over the place, I didn't form a bond with any characters or locations. It felt like the show completely lost its heart and soul.The first 3 episodes are nothing but a military brutality fest with no point other than to illustrate people are worse than the Monsters could ever be. I liked it better from ep 5 on, but it was still just a slog and I was glad to be done.I've never been so disappointed with a second season. Oh well, I'll always have the first.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Another Netflix show where dispite the dire and apocaliptical settings the characters find themselves in, they still retain awesome haircuts and great clothing! This aproach speaks volumes of the show already!
This serie is entertaining, it manages to create some tension and despite being cartoony, you can relate with the charaters tribulations. It has a fairly good cinematography and despite the budget, they have created some elements that work well. That said, if you쨈ve come because of the featuring monsters, this is for you. The rest is just kind of bad. For the plot and the story itself are nothing more than junior soap opera filled with clich챕s and basically more of the same. By now we have seen these kind of dilemas a million times over, and they make no effort to put a spin on this take. If you don쨈t mind the setting, like some monster flicks, you could do worse than this.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"As an avid fan of the horror genre and a dedicated viewer of K-dramas, ""Sweet Home"" had me intrigued from the very start. With confirmation of an impending second season sometime at the end of 2023 and an announced third season, it's the perfect time to reflect on this series.First things first, it must be said that the initial experience may throw you off. The first half of the first season threw me into a sea of confusion, as the dialogues came across as eerily emotionless and the characters seemed strangely unfazed by the unfolding apocalypse. They all felt like they didn't care about anything at all as the world fell apart around them and the extremely unnatural way in which dialogues were written didn't help. It all felt uncanny, and what seems even weirder is that it wasn't written like that by mistake. It was very deliberate and made me drop the show the first time I tried watching it.Yet, as the series went on, it seemed like the puzzle pieces started falling into place. And fall they did, around the midpoint of the first season, when the seemingly disjointed elements suddenly clicked into a coherent narrative. This part, though belated, was like a light in the darkness, and I appreciated how the creators skillfully justified their earlier enigmatic approach. In hindsight, I see the purpose it served, but I can't help but wonder if it could have been executed better. Based on my own experience, I assume that by the time the writers decided to reveal why the characters are the way they are, half of the people watching would have already dropped the show.Once the fog lifted, ""Sweet Home"" transformed into a tale of survival in a surprisingly interesting world, in which humans turned into monsters, who are actually embodiments of their deepest desires. This concept is nothing short of fascinating, and the creative design of these creatures truly deserves applause. I also love how they decided not to explain what each of these monsters is supposed to represent, leaving the viewer to decipher them on their own.The series' choice of the song ""Warrior"" by Imagine Dragons adds a layer of energy and intensity that complements the overall atmosphere. However, I must admit that the song's consistent appearance during major epic moments sometimes triggered unexpected laughter on my end, disrupting the intended awe. It's a minor setback, but one that's worth mentioning.I love when TV shows are bold. And ""Sweet Home"" is damn bold. What truly sets it apart is its willingness to shatter expectations. The abrupt and often unceremonious deaths of seemingly important characters kept catching me off guard, emphasizing the unforgiving nature of the apocalyptic setting. It's a risky move that effectively conveys the constant danger lurking around every corner, and I applaud the show for its audacity. In simpler words - if you haven't read the webtoon, then you will never expect who lives and who dies, and the show will kill your favorite character in seconds, without making it overtly dramatic.I'd also like to add that ""Sweet Home"" is beautiful, in the literal sense of the word. Aesthetically pleasing in every sense, the show captures its post-apocalyptic world with stunning attention to detail. The special effects are second to none and it's one of the reasons why I decide to watch Korean cinema over your regular western Netflix shows. Koreans always put a lot of effort into the worlds they create, putting enormous budget into special effects, even if the show in question is a risky endeavour and might flop completely. This particular series was very risky, because it's super weird and unique, instead of being your typical post-apocalyptic zombie flick you watch on a Friday evening and forget, and they still put $27 million into the first season itself (most of it, VFX I assume, since the cast isn't exactly well known)! Oh, Koreans also don't tend to cancel their shows if they're underselling, which is something Netflix US is consistent in :)As I look back on my journey through ""Sweet Home,"" I find myself torn. On one hand, the confusing first half of the first season left a significant dent in my overall enjoyment, but on the other hand, the second half redeemed the series with its narrative and jaw-dropping revelations. While I think the show has potential to be a perfect 10/10, the initial confusion holds it back. As of now, it stands at a solid 8/10, with hopes that the upcoming seasons will continue to elevate this rating.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The visuals of this movie are fantastic and the story is alright as well. However, there is so much drama, I almost laughed one time because of it. It feels like 60% to 70% of the time people are mourning and/or crying and it just takes a way the horror feel you want to have. I do think that the idea of making a horror more emotional is good concept in itself, but this is way way way too much. I had a hard time finishing the series because of it, but the fact that it still made me want to finish reflects in my 7/10 rating.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This thriller is incredibly immersive. It was so much fun to watch. I had to step outside for a moment to bring myself back to reality after binging a few episodes. It was so hard to stop watching.I wasn't a big fan of all the changed they made to the webtoon, but some changes were beneficial. Overall, they did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the webtoon.I loved seeing the characters and monsters come to life in this drama. I really appreciated that they actually created the masks instead of just relying on CGI. It's much more artistic to me that way.Really great show, not much to complain about.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'm not a fan of this genre. Graphics, battles and a story about survival are banal and unoriginal. Another thing - the characters. They are different and interesting, each with shortcomings and strengths. What is worth watching this series - it's just actors who are quite cute and beautiful. I would look at them forever.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The good: I loved this show and I'm glad there's gonna be seasons 2 + 3! I love dystopia/apocalypse type shows/movies so this is right up my alley. The scary part is that there is nothing external that contaminates you (as far as we know) - everyone has the potential to become a monster, very fitting to reality. We can all choose to be good or bad. Some people could fight the monster and some could not. It's a ""monster"" show but really it's about humans and how they fight their inner demons (or not). The Imagine Dragons song (Warriors) fits right in (so would Demons btw). Eun Hyeok takes charge right away while the adults just cower and stare. (I mean, in real life, it's common for us to freeze in a dangerous situation, but sheesh, do something!) The women were the strongest characters - the two teenage girls, the firefighter, even ajumma finally killing her abusive husband. The ambiguous good/bad guy conundrum with San Wook and the child molester. And the end when Hyun Su gets in the truck and only realizes it's a trap when it's too late. Nice cliffhanger for the next season, although it was frustrating to see that guy finally ""die""... and then shapeshift. Seeing Hyun Su finally let the monster out was cool! Although I don't know how his whatever it is fits his inner demon - he was contemplating living or killing himself, and then he turns into an angel? A demon? With only one (metallic and hot) wing? I liked the fact that monsters turned on each other. Hyun Su having to deal with his monster while trying to decide where his loyalty lies - with humans (who helped him) or with monsters (who would def kill him). He picked the monsters, and I hope he changes his mind in coming seasons. The scenes where his demon appeared with black eyes and that big smile were super creepy! The christian guy with a katana was badass but why did he have to die? I get it - he died a hero (I still hate it). But that whole fight sequence was really good despite the terrible consequence.The bad: Starts off strong then quickly loses steam. A lot of suspense with monsters that just come out of nowhere but after Giant Protein Man gets destroyed (awesome sequence btw) it's like the monsters just *poof* disappear. Several people get the nosebleeds... and then nothing. Clich챕 army + clich챕 gang were boring. The surviving adults finally fight back in the last 2/3 episodes. A lot of things go unexplained: Where are the rest of the people that live in that huge building? Why was there dirt in the basement? When did Bom the Pom disappear? Also -- Eun Hyok never showed any signs of ""infection"" yet in the last episode he stays behind and only then gets a nosebleed. I think he should have survived, as he would be strong enough to fight the infection. Characters took too long to develop, if at all; mostly the adults were just 2 dimensional, except for the badass amputee guy and the old man. People took on the form of their ""inner demon"" -- Protein Man was certainly a whey-obsessed exercise freak LOL But how did he get gigantic later? What was the green slimy thing that saved the little boy? Why would someone turn into a spider? Did the mom with the imaginary baby from the first episodes turn into the creepy giant womb? The other monsters were so boring that I can't even remember them.The awful: The CGI was awful terrible and horrible! The worst I've seen in a long time, especially for a show made in 2020. I've seen worse shows with way better SFX (Hellbound, for example). Some monsters were laughably bad. Protein man was the only good cgi. A lot of action sequences were too fast and/or disjointed to make sense.Conclusion: definitely for big fans of monster/apocalypse shows. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Despite the bland characters (adults) I was still rooting for each one to survive as the show progressed and I was sad when they didn't.

"I have no clue what my measly opinion is worth - here it is anyway:The animation and live action blend needed some work, however, I thought after the first few episodes it got MUCH BETTER - I enjoyed the blend even when the effects weren't high quality. I felt it was artistic.The storyline had me hooked. I ended up invested in many of the characters, including the secondary characters - for me that's tough to do. At first I was afraid the show would shy away from certain themes - heavens to betsy was I wrong. They didn't pull the punches or baby us through the drama. This seriously touched me. I'm raving about it.There are several interesting story lines that I hope they unravel in season 2 - fantastic take on monster drama (monsdrama) - and I'm on the edge of my seat for the next season. BRING IT ON.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I really like the monsters in this show, they are weird, creepy and very creative. The story line really pulled me in and keeps me watching as well.

"I settle back to watch a Korean webtoon based apocalyptic horror TV series (released on Netflix on December 18, 2020) and confusedly hear the lead in score of ""Dies irae"" (which is something like a 17th century Latin based Requiem Mass). Not a Korean score - oh wait... it is... arranged by Cho Yoon Jung? So, this is why I watch foreign films. It broadens my perspective.I have low expectations in regard to this particular genre - but, I am pleasantly surprised, entertained and impressed.There is some very good acting in some well written and directed roles. For example, Lee Do-hyun as Lee Eun-hyuk the accepted leader of a building's survivors.
Another example, Lee Si-young as Seo Yi-kyung, a former firefighter.
I could list a dozen more.A problem are the character roles thrown in for comedic relief which are horribly conceived and delivered. If those roles had been rewritten as dramatic roles the series would have been better. The child roles were atrocious. For some reason the children typically shouted their dialogue.I think I am not familiar with Korean culture and perhaps I do not understand the acting. For example, when the characters would do a hysterical sequence it always came across as whiny-screaming (I listened with Korean audio and English subtitles). Perhaps that is how individuals act hysterically in Korea? Maybe I should listen to the English actors dub and see if that comes across better for an American?Regardless, the series is surprisingly entertaining and I think individuals who enjoy this genre will enjoy Sweet Home.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"While reading Webtoon, I kept saying they must make this tv series. When I heard Netflix is making a live action,I was devastated. I thought they gonna ruin it but it turned out amazing. Whole story is thriller; no resting, no waiting, anything can happen any moment. You will be nervous all the time when you are watching because this is how it needs to be. If you want something slow and full of philosophy, go watch something else.Great acting and environment. Totally recommend.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"As someone who has read the original webcomic, I had high hopes for this show. The original version had well developed characters and intense horror scenes, with a pretty linear story line; escape the building full of monsters. This show however, is a little bit different, and not in a good way.Starting off, the show was great. The first episode opened much like the original webcomic, other than some changes in the characters that I wasn't a fan of. While the episode was a bit slow, it did a good job of setting the tone for the show and some unnerving scenes before the monster apocalypse even began. The characters felt a little underdeveloped, especially the main character, but the show makes up for that later on.It doesn't take long to realize something's wrong - very wrong. As members of the complex begin turning into monsters, the remaining residents are forced to band together. The earlier monsters are the same as in the webcomic, all uniquely terrifying, but the CGI is lacking and takes away a bit of the immersion.From what I remember, the first 4 episodes were great; full of action, drama, and most importantly - horror. There are plenty of gruesome scenes that will make your skin crawl, tension and drama between residents, with the overarching plot remaining faithful to the webcomic and easy to follow. After episode 4, however, is where it starts to go downhill. Less monsters, more humans. People making dumb decisions, bickering and whatnot. The show begins to slowly move away from the webcomic, and while still fine for most viewers, was disappointing to me.The show works hard at developing all the characters so you can understand them, and it does a pretty good job of that, despite perhaps coming into play a bit late. The main character doesn't get a lot of screen time, and has even less dialogue. Most of his scenes consist of fighting monsters and staring blankly at stuff, which seems to be something that all of the characters spend too much time doing. It felt like the writers were trying to make it clear that Hyun is an introverted recluse, but without spending much time on developing his character, so we get a lot of awkward scenes with blank staring. That, along with some weird dialogue, made the show a lot less entertaining to watch in the later episodes, especially when interactions between the characters became most of the show, as opposed to interactions with the monsters.-----------SPOILER SECTION BELOW------------
One of my least favourite changes from the webcomic is in Episode 6, where the firefighter lady leaves the apartment complex to go to her missing fianc챕s office on a motorcycle to look for answers, where she finds a group of what I think were her coworkers (firefighters) ALIVE, gets in an argument with them, and then returns to the complex on a fire truck. Like, what?? She manages to get out of the parking lot that is supposed to be full of monsters just fine, and then finds rescue workers who don't help her or the apartment in what feels like a meaningless conflict. Whatever.-----------------END OF SPOILERS----------------There is also a steep decline in quality in the last few episodes. The plot becomes confusing and difficult to follow, which builds up to an ending that it seems no one understand. I imagine it was only implemented to leave an opening for a second season, so basically, the show-runners ruined what was at one point a great show just to profit more off of the series. I don't expect the second season to be very good, but I guess we'll see.Overall, I'd say if you're looking for some gory monster horror, or apocalyptic setting, this is a good show to watch, as it provides a good amount of entertainment before it descends into confusing madness. It is not, however, a masterpiece, and you wouldn't be missing much if you decide on something else.6/10.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Got me hooked from episode 1!
Great weekend binge. Tension and action packed series. It's a crazy ride!
After 4 episodes it shifts focus on the drama of surviving rather than fighting the monsters (which rarely appear anymore). Overal it was a good show, with good acting and the best was the music and the action sequences.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Finished another kdrama
'Sweet Home' Season 2This is an apocalyptic survival drama based on webtoon, where humans turns into monsters.Season 2 came after 3 years.I didn't like S 1, but this time, I find myself enjoying the show. As per webtoon readers, this season is not loyal to webtoon. There are many new characters introduced.Drama has a mixture of Stranger things, Sweet Tooth, Last of US, Walking dead like such similar shows. CGI is hit-miss, there are some plotholes but for me it was intriguing throughout.Though my Song Kang was only there for 4 episodes
Will look forward for S3 which will come next summer.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I wish they either waited for better funding to the project or split the script in two seasons to tell the whole story. They tried to cram in the whole story along with heavy changes into 10 episodes. The problem with this is:Everyones character arc is watered down along with Cha Hyun-Su.The epic finale from the comics is reworked into some kind of military crap which is the default of every pandemic movie.The dark tone of the comic is reworked into the lines of an action movie rather than horror. Everytime something happens they spam Warriors by Imagine Dragons.Also whats up with the wierd camera cuts/jumps that happens all the time. It's like they skip 5 seconds forward during action scenes and you lose track of what's going on.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The show is ""ok"" but not on the level of Squid Game or Hellbound. Some interesting characters, some not, some good scenes and parts of a good story but it just drags way to far long. This should have been a ~6 episode season. I think it just tried too hard in the middle to try and be cleaver but just never reached that point. They could have cut so much junk out and done a much better job in far less episodes.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic themes, monsters, and gore, then this series probably got your attention. It got mine.Seuwiteuhom (2020) is heavy on gore, suspense, and drama. The gore is self-explanatory. The other two need in-depth details.The suspense is what kept me going. Not only because of the thrilling moments but also the curiosity to know what will happen next. Every episode does a great job of raising a question, a concern, and leaving answers for later. This kept my attention and gave me the motivation to keep watching until the end.Finally, the drama. This series is great about portraying the drama involved in this whole situation. And the character acting is outstanding. You care for people, you hate some people, you cheer for the heroes. In the end, I think this is all about humans, even though the main problem is the monsters.As for the monsters, I have to mention the cheap CGI. It definitely breaks your immersion. You need to numb your mind to this and watch it for the plot. In contrast, the practical effects are well done.I would definitely recommend it to everyone, but I know this is not for everyone. Casual watchers will not like this series. Gore and monster lovers will like it, maybe.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Sweet home is not particularly original by international movie standard - the first episode is a direct hommage to Delicatessen, and it's second episode a direct-to-film adaptation of a webtoon, complete with upside down camera shots. We've seen it all before.However, from episode 4 onwards, it really picks up pace and starts asking some interesting questions. Confucianism clashes with Christianism in an excellent mish mash unlike anything on Netflix.Another excellent point is that it doesn't cater to its financiers woke values, and maintains traditional Korean values at its core throughout. A bresh of fresh air in a world of woke ignorance. Based K-drama to the rescue?Sweet Home also shines in the SFX departement. It drops the 'Rotoscope' effects by episode 3 and by episode 9 it's on par with Hollywood. The characters are interesting, and the plot is helped tremendously by the clever ploy through which people 'turn' into monsters, which I won't spoil for you.A must watch for anyone into the mystery/thriller genre-fiction with some element of horror/suspense.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Sweet Home: South-Korean TV series, mostly set in an apartment block. There is a conspiracy at work here, some state actors new things were wrong before the outbreak. People transform into different types of monsters, zombies, giant spiders, gel creatures, shape-shifters. A motley crew try to survive in the block, infighting, suspicion are rife but people also co-operate. Dark in more ways than one with the tower block interiors. Some of the back stories are a bit soapish but others contain elements of existential terror. Some great fight scenes with the mnsters but there are also tangles with marauders and soldiers. Great fun. Multipe directors and writers based on the Naver webtoon of the same name by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan. On Netflix. 8/10.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

That's probable in my opinion..There are many well known south korean actors in that 2nd season even more than in the 1st season, but who wrote the plot, I am curious to know because really even a 12 year old could have done better. Who wrote the plot I want to know !",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

But the plots of some part were not described deeply, that's a little unfortunately.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

It gets better and better when all the characters develop. I understand it, I get it. Bypass the mediocre graphics and understand the overall tv show. It's brilliant, it's different. I do like all the characters, and I love the acting, they have some of my favorite supporting characters in other Korean shows. It develops and it changes. It's not your typically survive from monsters tv show, it brings a different element to it. I really hope it has a second season and this is higher than a 7.5 in my opinion. I think it has potential to 7.8-8.3 overall. Each character have their own story and there is more story to come. I wish people would leave reviews after watching a few episodes instead of jumping to conclusion. I agree, I did not like it at first and I thought about it like a dark comedy but it develop into something serious, especially when you like all the characters. People, please, chill out and give it a try. Support new ideas instead of bashing on it with weak reviews. I think it's a 8.3 but I'll rate it a 10 to help with the ratings because it will turn away people, it's not bad of a tv show as how some people made it to be. I already binged 9 episodes in 2 days. Good stuff, chill out please.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The show's first few episodes were terrific. Great monsters and special effects. About midway the nihilism and the convoluted plot derail what could have been an Awesome series. The ending makes no sense and is clearly a half assed set up for a second season. Also, the MC is quite frankly a sad sack from beginning to end - so don't expect any redemptive character arc. Every episode is filled with people emoting and crying constantly - which works in the first few episodes but becomes numbingly tedious as the show continues to its conclusion. The actors are all uniformly good and are given some space to really shine. However, even the character standouts are eventually left stranded by the nonsensical script. Worth watching though but don't expect to leave the table satisfied.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I'm so confused why this isn't t rated higher this drama was really good I enjoyed every moment.. sometimes ratings don't actually don't reflect well on a show or people don't go further than episode one then rate it low but this is definitely one you should watch I loved it.. definitely a 10/10 for me.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

It never really regains the flair and interest it starts with.Absolutely worth watching, and it manages to stay watchable all the way through.Just don't expect it to keep up the pace.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"What a fantastic show. It made me realize that Hollywood stopped making monster movies long time ago... it's all zombies, vampires and ghosts and nothing else now. This was so refreshing. I binged on it for a few nights.What was even more refreshing is the Korean cast... it was so nice to take a break from American ""culture"" and actually see good people, just plain simple, good, nice, all likeable people without typical annoying American ""baggage"". Nobody in this show was annoying. It was like taking a breath of clean mountain air.Very original, great atmosphere, great characters, great cinematography, great pace, great action, dialogue, I have nothing to complain about at all... it was much more enjoyable than anything Hollywood made in recent years.I will definitely be looking for more Korean movies/TV shows now.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I can give max 6.5/10 only because the idea of different monster types are only copies from many movies and dramas.

"Someone wrote, don't give up after the first episode. I feel exactly the opposite, the first 3-4 episodes were excellent. After that it became more soap opera with every episode. Probably Koreans will say this is not that Korean, that it is a westernized version. I'm Hungarian so viewing this series it seemed very Asian to me. The interaction, the greetings, the politeness and manner, relationships between characters are very Asian. For example the relationship between the guy with the sword and the bass player girl (I'm sorry but the names were really difficult to me to know) is just a platonic love and then the guy dies. In a western film there would have been at least kissing but more likely sex. Or the long takes on the meaningful gazes of the characters.In the first couple episodes the monsters are excellent, but around the 7-8 th episode it dies down the story becomes more drama driven. The music was mixed, it tried to have classical and modern pieces alike. They seem to have bought the Warriors Imagine Dragons song (which I'm sure was pretty expensive) so they overplayed it.
Yeah I get it, the real monsters are the humans losing their humanity in this series, but that took away the horror part too fast.There are some illogical parts or plot holes like monsters don't die. But the first one (the women that wants to kill Hyun-Su) dies directly after being her faced kicked into pulp and after that several monsters are killed of.Overall a really good experience and it kept me watching but to be honest it was getting more predictable and flat nearing the end.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Graphics are not realistic, at one point I was laughing at how ridiculous the ""monsters"" looked. One of them looked exactly like a Halloween mask bought at the dollar store.The show also focuses on wayyyy too many characters, to point where you're confused on the importance of their role. Back and forth between characters, constantly. A lot of scenes had no importance nor did they add any complexity to the storyline. The timeline of the scenes also make no sense, leaving you frustrated. Overall a super messy show.Watch this only if you're under lockdown and have binged everything else on Netflix.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I was lucky enough to stumble upon the Webtoon about 2 weeks before the final chapter, and not to be too harsh on the netflix adaptation but...As enjoyable as it was, the webtoon imo is a much more airtight and engaging story. It seems as if they want to make a second season to wrap up the story but the original did everything and more in around 150 chapters if i remember correctly. But regardless i'm very happy to see something like this get the attention it deserves. Regardless Carnby Kim is a god damn mastermind.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I had the series in my to watch list for a while, but I honestly didn't feel like watching something meh. When I saw the most recent reviews and their positive reaction, I decide to give it a chance. Started it with low expectations, but was completely drawn in after the first episode. I couldn't stop watching and watched the entire season in two days. I am still mind blown, hence writing my first review. It was so fun to watch, the story was an original twist on a doomsday scenario and I caught myself getting attached to characters that I usually don't care about. And I love that they didn't feel compelled to keep all the main characters alive. The backstory might be a little hard to swallow if you are not used to watching asian movies/series, however for me it did not take away from the main story too much. There were a few flaws here and there, but it actually gave the series character.

They turned out really well in my opinion.Update after season 2:
Unfortunately, in its second season the series loses all the charm that made it so special in the first season.The first season was special because the horror of the series arose from the fact that the residents have to stay in this residential complex and there is no escape from this situation. In addition, the monsters in the first season were designed in a really interesting way.In the second season the whole thing somehow develops into a mediocre ""The Walking Dead"" clone. The characters now roam through the landscape and are attacked here and there. Then someone is infected or injured and mistrust arises. The monsters no longer contribute anything except to shock and their design is now largely very boring.Season 2 also introduces about 15 new characters, which is just too many to introduce all at once. What's worse is that these characters are all also interchangeable and boring, except for one character who is quite interesting.That's why I'm reducing the rating from 8 times to 7.I'll take a look at the third season, but I don't have high expectations.It's a shame, it really could have been something new and unique...",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

What I mean is that it manages to keep you entertained even after the first couple monster scenes when you realize how ""Low Budget"" everything looks and you think that you are not going to want to keep watching but then the story starts and you realize you actually like these characters and the story is just ""un-corny"" enough that you actually want to figure out what is going on and almost get a little invested in certain characters.Don't get me wrong...there are some huge and confusing things that happen but you end up not really caring however if you were to watch it a 2nd or 3rd time you'd probably want to know what the heck just happened but yeah not too shabby.I went with the 8 stars because like most of the Netflix series I've seen that have subtitles and are dubbed the words don't match with what the actors are saying so you don't know which to follow. (I noticed that the words seemed a bit more detailed/correct than the subtitles but could be wrong.)As much as I like the main characters I'd be interested in learning more about the rest of the cast but hopefully that will happen next season! I still have a couple episodes left but I'm interested in seeing what happens and how he ends up where he is in the opening scenes.EDITED TO ADD:

"I really enjoyed this series. The mix of horror, drama, and cinematography are well done. In regards to the cinematography, it's not about great vistas and scenery. It's the way the actors are filmed. The acting is very good, many of the actors are really quite good looking. While I rarely like Action or horror productions that dwell overly on human relationships, because the writing is often not very good and melodramatic. I found myself reasonably invested in the fortunes of the various characters and the group as a whole. The CGI is professional, but much of the series is not about monsters, but about people trying to survive. Threats come from different and unexpected sources, which kept me involved. I would be very happy to see a second season if they decide to produce one.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
The cgi is kinda wonky at some scenes but the whole show grips you in and it just wants more. I love the lack of the whole Wokeness and inclusivity trash that we are being served from the west.

With the status of western shows these days ill watch anything that is not Ms. Marry Sue defeats bad white man by beaing better than bad white man. It has been a long time since i watched a show and went daym i want more and not gasp and say finally its done jeeez what a pain. I cant shower enough praises to korean shows and i hope the whole production steps it up a little bit in the cgi department. That is my only critique so far.

And also he will talk to mosterous design of himself too many times not only one or two. Also in the series i didnt get sweet home atmosphere. In comic, main character will despise his own family and won't even shed a tear wen they dead but at the end he will giv in to his desire to protect all people that was with him and also in the imagination world he wil return to his dead family side happily. Tats y its sweet home. Also because the music title. Then only he wil turn into monster.

"I decided to watch this series on a whim. It's an interesting disaster drama that seems to take its inspirations from the Spanish movie Rec and the Hollywood movie Quarantine. However, they replaced the truly horrific scenes with over-the-top monsters that were over the top, cliches and cartoonish. This is one of the top gripes I have about this Kdrama.The other biggest gripe I have about this Kdrama is the inclusion of religion and faith, specifically Christianity. That is a huge and major turnoff in any Kdrama for non Christian viewers. Unfortunately, it seems like it is a trend these days. Interestingly, 60% of Koreans do not have a religion according to Wikipedia, and only 23% are Christians or similar. So did the South Korean Church fund or extend its tentacles into this Kdrama, or is Netflix trying to reach out to its Christian audience? Either way, any references to religion, especially Christianity, seem like a hard sell and evangelism to me. That alone would keep me away from such drama, or make me view them in a less favorable light if I do watch them.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

This show is the most expensive Netflix show made in South Korea so I had high expectations but after watching the trailer I was kinda disappointed. CGI monsters look likes garbage to me, yes in this series they look like PlayStation 2 game. That's the biggest weakens in this series. When it comes to practical effects they have done a great job. Sweet Home reminds me of Resident Evil and Train to Busan. The plot is good but there are few plot holes. This is not just another zombie drama because these monsters are not easy to kill and every each monster is very unique that's one of the main reasons for me to keep watch this series. I loved the cinematography and color grading. There are a lot of close-up shots. It reminds me of the dexter intro which is really awesome. This is the most aggressive kdrama I have ever watched, there is a lot of violence and blood. They have a top-notch cast for this series and there not going to disappoint you. Every character in this series felt real to me. there are a lot of character developments throughout the series. There were a few characters that I need a backstory for them. The soundtracks are good but there was imagine dragons song and I felt that is not necessary for the scenes. Overall this is a good show with a lot of entertainment and I hope they develop their CGI in the next seasons.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This show is incredibly fun to watch. The atmosphere is compelling, it follows a lot of familiar (and beloved) tropes while still introducing unique spins on things, and the acting is solid. There are incredibly frustrating aspects to the show, which I assume is a result of adapting a webtoon. For example, a webtoon panel might have someone staring while a fight is going on, but in the show it comes across as ridiculous because they just stare into space for 30 seconds at a time. It gets to a point where you're genuinely in awe any of these people have survived. It's a bit campy--a monster screaming ""PROTEIN"" is really hard to take seriously especially within a show that takes itself very seriously.I'd never read the webtoon before watching. I did pick it up after finishing the show and I think it explains why the show feels awkward at times. The webtoon has a lot more levity and doesn't take itself as seriously. There's a lot of humor to break up the tension and make characters likeable. The show is so determined to be gritty and realistic that it gives itself no space for suspension of disbelief. Again, a monster screaming about protein feels wildly out of place in the show but suits the webtoon.If you go into the show without expecting it to perfectly match the webtoon and are able to take it as it is, you'll have fun. It's a love it or hate it kind of show and I think approaching it as a campy monster show will set expectations more appropriately. A lot of reviewers said to give it 3 episodes to kick in, but expecting anyone to invest 3 hours before a show picks up is unreasonable. If you like the first episode, you'll probably like the whole show and vice versa.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I loved everything after the first half of the first episode. The serie caught attention since the beginning with an amazing picture, actuations and a nice OST.All of the characters felt humand and had their own development, you get to know each of them and their back story.The only thing I disliked was the CGI but it's something you can give the blind eye because the series is really good. I really hope if there's a second season, they will make better this aspect. I can't wait to see how this story will continue.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Great acting. Good music. Good concept. Great special effects. Good characters. Good plot. Bad script.,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I love end of the civilization, and this is a very good one about it. I have not seen the webtoon so I can not comment on the virtues of the webtoon. Yet in the series characters get developed and the acting is pretty good. Directier had done a very good job and the screens and the palet they choose are stunning. The amount of gore and blood is not over the board. If you love apocalyptic series this is one of the very good ones.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"SEASON 1
------------STORY: 6
Anime plot. Don't take it too seriously and you'll be entertained. Script is pretty bare-boned, which is a good thing in an action flick. Some weird lines here and there, but it's possible language barriers played a role there.DIRECTING: 7
Not an easy task to translate the source material into the screen. But while there may be nothing exceptional to speak of in the details (that i noticed), the result is a very solid and artfully storyboarded adaptation. Pacing is somewhat slow at some points, with the camera lingering on way after the scene has been exhausted. But this can be forgiven in a TV show trying to hit the runtime mark for each episode - not an easy editing task. And this filler is minimal and doesn't affect engagement too much.ACTING: 9
I'm always extremely impressed with the average level of South Korean actors. Whatever they're teaching in those Drama classes, everyone else in the world should be taking notes. The whole cast is incredible expressive, colourful and nuanced. Can't fully rate their competence on line delivery though, since i don't speak the language.CINEMATOGRAPHY: 9
Just spectacular. Camera work is excellent and lighting is on a class of its own. Grimy post-apocalyptic sets with cranked up to 11 saturation filters are the ultimate eye-candy.VFX: 7
Hard to rate this. Not a huge budget for a very ambitious ensemble of monsters with a lot of screen time, often too well lit. So it's barely above passable, basically on par with your typical video-game cut-scene, at times better, other times much worse. But creature and set design alone would push the rating closer to a 9 and gore effects are a solid 10. I'm still scratching my head on how they pulled off those nosebleeds.SEASON 2
------------
Don't bother.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The story is addicting enough to make you want to know what happens at the end. There are some attempts at character development to provide some reasoning for the motivations. It is Return of the Living Dead, X-Men and the Mist.
There are many comments about the horrible CGI and it is true. The CGI was almost at a level of a talented teenager with a laptop and Adobe. Since the series has certain level of dark comedy, I was able to look past that. I was not able to look past that this 10-hour series could have very easily been a very good 2.5 hour movie. There was extremely amount of filler that did not provide any additional context to the move.Other big problem was editing which is the reasoning for my 4 stars. It is disjointed to say the least. It is almost like they taped entire scenes and then cut out the bloopers or mistakes and stitched together what was left with reshooting anything. There are many jumps, skips and entire characters appearing and not appearing and darkness that makes it hard to know what is going on(think Game of Thrones White Walker battle in Season 8). A five second action scene can have 15+ edits and you end up confused. Other big issue....the ending, I have no idea what happened in the last 15 minutes.For some people this may be a 7 or 8 star while for most 'adults' it will be 6 at best.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'm big fan of zombie/disaster type, loved the Kingdom. Sweet home is walking dead against monsters instead of zombies. Everything is taking place inside an old apartment building. Feels like character development, relationship building is about 70% of the show, 30% being fighting monsters.Pros:
1. Top notch production value, acting, lighting, cinematics, music.
2. Distinct main characters
3. Decent story
4. Very interesting creature design, good variety in that you never know what monstrocity an ""infected"" person will turn into.Cons:
1. Main character's go to response for a question or statement being a stunned, silent stare, lasting 10, 15 seconds at times.
2. People are way too emotional than they ought to be, and crying too much. Scenes get dragged out, trying too hard to elicit an emotional response.
3. Monster threat level could be cranked up a few notches. I was more worried at a later point in time when our group of survivor is facing a different type of threat. Much more unpredictable and way more damaging than the monsters.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Absolutely fantastic, brilliant drama series. Looked forward to the release ever since the trailer came about. Binged watched in one day. It was so eye gripping and intense but field with the whole range of emotions. Brilliant actors, main actor did outstanding job also with his role in particular Cha Hyun Soo portrayed by Song Kang also the CGI was not bad, it was okay for what it was. Absolutely recommend this drama, and hope season 2 can be confirmed.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'd recommend it if you have a lot of free time and nothing to watch. The only thing i hate about this show is the music & songs. I think they did a bad
thing when it comes to music & songs , because
i watched many scenes in the show that would be
better without the music. It's like the show's crew
are ordered to put these songs & music by force.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This show only gets better episode by episode. The characters are interesting and the monsters are unique, the story keeps you hooked as they reveal more and more about the characters and the ""curse"" (or whatever you wanna call it). Perfect combination of survival, monsters, action and drama.
The only negative thing I could think of is the cgi, but it didn't even bother me that much since the storyline is so good.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'm more than half way through the first season and I enjoy it. I think the critique that this show is a bit Walking-Deadesque is slightly valid. But I think there's far less interpersonal drama in this show.The characters are all quite different and sympathetic and aggravating in their own way. The conflicts are believable. The pacing is on point.But just like all East Asian horror, the show does feel like it leaves a bit too much to the viewers imagination. I remember being gobsmacked at one particularly inexplicable scene. There's also a distinct lack of levity in this series. The subject matter and the shows approach are HEAVY. Almost too a fault.Still despite these shortcomings this one I'm glad I found and one that I plan on watching through to the end",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Nothing I can say, its just Excellent!
First the Kingdom and this Sweet Home! I have another reason to subscribe at netflix hhaha",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Everything about season 1 was incredible, from the variety of monsters to the claustrophobic environment to the character relationships, i loved every minute of it. And then season 2 came around. And i honestly felt like i was watching an entirely new series with predictable twists and a boring plot. We no longer follow the story of the main character in fact we don't even see him until roughly episode 5 of season 2. So many irrelevant characters are brought in to hulk out the storyline and the military is included, making it seem like every other post apocalyptic show out there. In season 1 it was a fight of ordinary people against unpredictable monsters, it was so much more personal but the inclusion of the military makes it so much more detached. I hope season 3 redeems this.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The world building is fantastic, it is full of interesting characters with excellent character development. Brilliant acting. Fast paced and full of action. The CGI can be better but I can look past it because the overall production is 1st class.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"It's well worth watching, it's a good show, as expected from korean horror cinematography the characters are charismatic and the show is exciting and addictive, and full of emotion, but don't expect the storyline to make much sense. It's the kind of show you'll shout to the screen expecting characters to be smarter; but they won't.I hope there's gonna be a second season, there's still many questions with no answer, but for the looks of it this may be it; and that's fine.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Story was good but the way they executed the scenes are really bad. You don't understand what is happening there. Sometimes I felt I skipped some scenes because you don't feel the connections between previous scenes and present scenes. They are like showing so many scenes at a time without any reason and explaination. They will show you the reason after two episode that's too late. I don't understand one thing why some people came and attack them and kill them no reason nothing that was stupid. I don't understand the monologue of the characters also. And yes CGI is bad!All actors are good. They did fabulous jobI.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"It was an interesting and entertaining watch.Especially looking for some monster feature style fun.I did start to lose who everyone was though near the middle or when the main character cut his hair. It was chaotic, but that's part of the story action. The last episodes lagged due to the characters standing there for long periods of time staring at something for what seemed like forever, which seats to be comedic, then becomes boring, then a little annoying. But still interesting nonetheless. I would say, especially if you like horror like me, it's worth checking it out.Also Korean shows and movies are pretty entertaining and have interesting premises. I've been a fan of Korean TV/Film for a long time. It's getting better and better, especially in the horror genre.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
This id consider an original so far got all different kind of monsters but yet it still has to do with a virus....i like the fact they took virus zombie to mutating monsters lookin like theyd be coming up from the bottom of hell instead... not really a zombie show id say but i love it,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"It's Korean. So you kind of know what your going to be getting when it comes to the main characters. You always have the ""comedy rolls"" and there is no exception here. I can find these characters annoying, but in Sweet Home, there is definitely enough crazy monster stuff going on to take your mind of them.
This is not perfect but very enjoyable. The story does start to fade to the end, maybe two episode to long.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Its realy like walking dead, human is the true monster, but overall i like the way the series approach, the character well developed and how our emotion take control, how we subdue our emotion, our desire, and how we as human act when trouble came.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This show starts off strong as a horror drama, but devolves into a silly comedy in the later episodes. For example, there are ridiculously inopportune and overused upbeat rock music and pop music playing during what supposedly seems like horror or tragic moments. There are also recycled cliched (Hollywood esque) tropes of a white collar worker playing out his samurai fantasies of swinging a katana and taking on monsters, main characters surviving what would normally be fatal injuries for no reason other than plot armor, people getting rescued at the last minute, and other cliched hero saves the day from monsters tropes. This show had a lot of potential nut seems to waste it in the later episodes.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I don't like zombie movies, but this is absolutely brilliant. From episode one to the end, it's interesting, lot's of action, special effects brilliant, good story line. It's the best series for 2020 for me!
Brilliant brilliant brilliant!!!!
I hope there is a season 2. ?솋?뤋 ?솋?뤋 ?솋?뤋",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The beginning of the show had me pretty hooked, but once I got towards the the last few episodes the dialogue, the characters, everything really just fell off for me. I almost just wanted it to end.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Just finished all the ep. I spent two nights for this and really love it. I like all the way they created the monsters and the cast especially the high school boy Hyun Soo.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I really liked this new take on Zombie films. To link the metamorphosis to a monster with trauma in the past is a great image of depression and trauma in the real world. Really great. I wished they would have done a little more with that. Unfortunately they had some silly decision-making, a lot of tell-don't show and sometimes a little over-the-top acting. Also some of the deaths (in some cases they might come back) of characters were just unnecessary and not logical at all. Also when the gang showed up they were a way over-the-top evil as well. I would rather liked to have seen more of trauma and how monsters are the image of everybody dealing with this. But I complain too much. It is well shot and acted most of the time, there is a good score and the CGI is mostly well, sometimes a little cheap, but it is a TV-show. It does not bother me. Also the kid actors were good as far as I can tell, not being a native speaker. What is sometimes bothering me a little bit is the rules of this world. Apparently you cannot kill the monsters but they still attack them with fire and so on. Why? They should rather trap them somewhere or something. People don't have to die fighting a thing they can't kill (the elevator-fire scene). But as I said, overall a good watch. Let's hope there is more of psychology and less of bang-bang kill (probably not).",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The story rushes into assorted monster attacks too quickly without establishing an emotional connection with the characters or background story. Not scary or exciting if you don't care for the characters. Unusual for a Korean series to lack an emotional connection. This series has a one dimensional story with less depth than usual. Only later in flashbacks do you get to know the characters but it's too late by then. The viewer is plunged into a post apocalyptic gory mess quite quickly without enough explanation and the attacks feel repetitive and monotonous. And the gratuitous violence is out of place in a Korean series.
Visually the monsters and effects look good. The cast is good and likeable with 18 Again's Lee Do Hyun, Love Alarm's Song Kang, Lee Jin Wook surprisingly good as a tough guy and Park Kyu Yung of It's Okay.
I prefer Kingdom or the excellent Odd Family Zombie for Sale to Sweet Home.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I knew that Korean films can be refreshing so when i picked this i was not suprised. Interesting story something between walking dead Mist and Evil dead. Some really good asian actors .Negatives:Some times the script or the way people react is reallly stupid . I do not know if this is a Asian or Korean trope but like in episode 8 that one really cool character dies and the rest look at him for over 5 minutes to die without even trying to help him. This repeats again and again. It reminds me the stories you hear about china that people do not help people in problem but walk away. Who knows Still a good show much better than other trash that Netflix produces.,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"Something strange happens to me with this series. Season 1 is very good, it suffers, it is true, from visual effects that seem bad at times but it has a lot of soul, the characters are charismatic, you empathize with each one of them and you care about what happens to them. Season 2 focuses on the military side and opens up many plots that are of rather little interest. He gets rid of the characters from season 1, even killing several of them, and the ending becomes a little anticlimactic. It also affects that 3 years have passed between seasons, luckily we have the third in a few months to see if the plots are satisfactorily resolved. For me, season 1 is a 7/10 and season 2 is a 5/10.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Just finished watching this show. I must say , at first I was thinking hmm should I actually watch this. Then I gave it a go and didn't regret at all. Loved the characters, music, the gore element, tonnes of blood thrown in ,with a great story and some over the top monster action.
I am sure they have to come up with Season 2 now. Watch this you won't regret, something different on TV rather than the usual boring PC stuff.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'll start off by saying that I'd never even heard of the source material going into this show, so everything I say is based strictly on the 10 episodes released thus far. In a nutshell, Sweet Home is best enjoyed with your brain turned half way between off and on.I'll start off with the positives1) I was never bored while watching Sweet Home - I feel like this is a show about moments than an complex story. First and foremost, a show needs to be entertaining, and the writers, and performers, did a good enough job of keeping me entertained and interested from episode to episode.2) Some of the monster designs were spectacular - I love nothing more than seeing practical effects and make-up bring monsters to life. While some of the monsters suffer from terrible CGI being used to bring them to life, some of the designs really stood out as something else.3) There are some moments of genuine emotion - In the earlier episodes, there were some moments that legitimately had me feeling sympathy for the characters, which is incredibly important for making me care about them.Now for the negatives1) Incredibly confusing scene to scene editing - there are scenes in Sweet Home that were literally seconds apart that had me asking myself ""did I black out for a few minutes or something?"". With out spoiling things, characters go from having a conversation in one scene, to on the verge of death from a medical complication in the very next scene. In another scene a character is fighting a monster, the focus shifts to another scene, and that same character just shows up later, no explanation of how they escaped their situation. In some episodes it literally feels like there are scenes missing.2) Bewildering musical choices -The original score is really solid, and fits well (overall) with the show. However, they must have paid through the nose for that Imagine Dragons song, because it gets used a lot. There was even a very emotional scene that was ruined because they slapped this song over the scene for seemingly no reason.3) Seemingly random character deaths - Again, I haven't read the source material, but I can't imagine some of the characters died the same way as they did in the show. I understand that, realistically, people would seemingly die at random in a situation like this, but it doesn't make for the best story. Typically in a story, a major character is killed at the end of their arc or to build emotion/hatred towards a villain. There were two pretty quick major character deaths in the show that left me more baffled than angry at the person who killed them. If I'm left confused and underwhelmed by a major character death, then you've more or less killed them off for nothing.4)Chekhov's gun... or monster - without spoilers, there is a monster that appears to be unique because it acts differently from the other monsters that are simply filled with the urge to kill without reason. In fact this monster goes out of its way to help a character. However the reasons for this monster's difference were left unexplored. It sort of left me feeling like the rule of Chekhov's gun had been broken. If you're not going to explore something unique you've introduced, just leave it out altogether.5) Terrible pacing, in general - I feel like this was due to the writers wanting to reach a certain point of the source material by the 10th episode, while still fitting as many of the scenes and moments from the source material in as possible. I think they would have been better off either taking things a little more slowly, or leaving some parts out. Nothing kills a story faster than bad pacing, and this show has some of the worse I've ever seen.To sum up, despite my negative sounding review, I actually really enjoyed watching Sweet Home (when I didn't think too much about it), and I might even give it a second watch down the line. I'm interested to see if, and how, the story continues - they clearly left some cliffhangers in there. I'd really like to see what to world of Sweet Home is like outside of that one apartment building.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I couldn't get into this show until the second episode, and the CGI is awful. However, starting with the second episode, this show becomes quite gripping. There is a particularly horrific scene in which a child is killed in front of her mother. The actress who plays the mother of the child deserves an award for her amazing performance. Part of what makes this show riveting is that it's not afraid to put characters who are children in peril and the show makes you genuinely afraid that a child could be killed. Also, it's refreshing that the evil creatures are monsters for a change instead of zombies. However, I have to deduct a point for a boring first episode and another point for awful CGI.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I usually enjoy these type of genres and idea, however this series seem very difficult for me to be intrigued about or actually entertained. Like everyone else I was so hyped for this adaptation and the cast and the director. But Instead I felt annoyed and confused at times. Also who edited the music into the action/thrill scenes and thought the music was good choice for it??? I'm sorry but it felt so out of place and kills my mood. Also the mannequin stares that lasts for hours at the monsters was so unrealistic, like who tf gonna just stand there? Like we all have reflexes we aren't puppets. For the budget the cgi wasn't even the best, surely they all look unique and cool but it didn't blend in with the surroundings. Also the characters felt way less interesting compared to the Webtoon. Not to mention the cliffhanger....ig they going for another season. Overall something I'd watch if I have nothing else to watch. Story 7/10, pace 4/10, acting 8/10, music 3/10. It didn't feel memorable to me. Sorry to the fans since this is based on my experience and opinions.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I wanted to watch something to keep me entertained, and this definitely kept me entertained. I finished all 10 episodes in two days. Some people will nitpick every little flaws but I loved the characters, the action and the special effects. If you're into long drawn out storyline with character development, just stick with the walking dead, but if you're into a good apocalyptic action shows/movies, then this may be for you. You may also want to check out ""Kingdom"" (Korean zombie action drama). Very good!
I'm really hoping for a second season to ""Sweet Home""!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Sweet Home has a cool premise. The apocalypse happens and our cast are waiting it out with possibility of monsters wrecking them or them turning into monsters. What makes the show not work for me are the performances of the actors and theses monsters themselves. Honestly, you don't feel too much for this cast, 3 of the actors look like they either in a constant state or confusion or worry even when nothing is happening. There are a few sad moments but they're easily forgotten when a monster that looks like it belongs in a haunted house shows up and gets in a 1-1 with imagine dragons playing the background. Also can we talk about that?? IMAGINE DRAGONS. LIKE 4 TIMES, it was surprising choice the first time but became a joke as it diluted the intensity of serious moments.Overall: The show isn't bad, just not the most enthralling. The characters aren't the most engaging other than the gangster and he says maybe a sentence an episode. I'd say watch the first few episodes and make a choice, hopefully the story gets more interesting if there's a season 2.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"If you haven't read the webtoon and you enjoy watching apocalyptic movies or shows I think you will find it entertaining, however if you previously read the webtoon and you are a fan of it I don't think you will enjoy this.I had big expectations for this show as I previously read the webtoon, however the adaptation they did on the show is so bad.1. The portrayal of the main character is awful. In the show he is more like a side character, he doesn't have any personality, development or a connection with any other character, they completely changed him.2. They introduce characters that didn't existed before (they had more screen time than the main character) and removed characters that were essential for the story on the web comic.3. The story is so rushed that it doesn't have any impact when a character dies.4. The story is so different to the original one, i felt like I was watching the walking dead.5. There are a lot of annoying characters that don't add anything to the plot (they're just there).6. Jisu is a very important character on the webtoon (she is one of the main ones) but here she is not (just like hyun), I was very disappointed by this.7. Also the music doesn't fit the atmosphere of some of the scenes. I remember that in a scene with Hyun that's supposed to be scary or intense they put a rap, like... what? (It was a nice song but still).In conclusion I don't recommend to watch this if you are a fan of the webtoon.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"Alright survival plot but they had to keep it ""true Korean"" and priorities dramatization over sense and continuity. Especially at the last couple of episodes, which made the whole show feels alot cheaper than it actually is. I lost all interest in the action scene because of this. It had me invested enough to not give up, though. I just skipped over the nonsense drama and floated through the dumb action part to get to the ending, mostly so it wouldn't have been a total waste of time. It's definitely acceptable entertainment during lockdown but don't expect any any more than that.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Maybe, they showed some treat of Korean society but I didn't understand the deep sense of it & for me, these moments were super dull.On the other hand, I like the social elements of the series and its connections with real problems. Moreover, all these stories are more valuable than sci-fi effects.And the guy with katana was nice. I've cheered for him.So in general it's something in the middle between Squid game and Hellbound. It's even more connected with the last one because of the style of special effects. Also so creepy and funny.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"Sweethome's first season was okay, with some acting issues and confusing moments, but it still had its fun moments. The practical effects were good , adding a layer of realism and excitement to certain scenes. However, Season 2 took a nosedive. The acting and storyline problems got worse, and the new characters they brought in were forgettable. A total mess.Moreover, the impressive practical effects that contributed to the visual appeal in the first season almost disappeared, the CGI, which was somewhat okay in the first season, turned out to be a letdown in the second. The drop in quality from the practical effects and CGI in Season 1 to the lackluster visuals in Season 2 further contributed to the overall disappointment.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The first two episodes or so I was a bit sceptical and didn't really know what to think of this. But the acting and the quality of the series got better episode by episode.The first Korean tv series that I watched completely and will keep on watching when they release more seasons.I don't know where all the bad reviews are coming from. I really liked the series. It was genuine, had meaningful deaths and the video game atmohsphere with the cgi was good.Season 2 was also good. Not as good because there was too much stuff going on at the same time. Cha Hyun-su has a very good and promising role in the series.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I always see a synergy between Netflix and Korean works unlike the crushing failure you experience in Indian and Arabic businesses, even Korean series of the mystery and bloody category that are not produced by Netflix are truly different and impressive, such as The Mouse series, which I like to call it the king of shocks and unexpected events. As for this series, it is really very good, but I think that something was missing for it to become a masterpiece. The first season begins normally with Hyun Soo Cha moving to his new home with a few flashes of his past, and suddenly events begin to escalate very quickly and without progression or preparation for them, which makes you as a viewer confused and confused. You did not even recognize the characters and did not memorize their faces and names, and then the events return. To go normally with dialogues that are okay, but I really liked Hyun Soo's acting and his portrayal of the character. I admit that I had difficulty understanding his past and I almost treated the character unfairly, but his story is good. As for the second season, it was really great. I liked how brutality was defined as not a disease. Rather, it is a person who is immersed in his desires, and that savagery is an evolution and a double-edged sword, and that a person may be a monster even if he does not transform. I also liked the progression of events, which improved a lot from the first season. I also liked the development of Eun Lee's character. She made me care about her journey to search for her brother. I also liked how I hated Bi Young for her harsh treatment of her daughter to protect her. This series excelled in making you relate to its characters. Also, some points that were not clarified in the first season were revealed with an interesting ending. I fault Netflix for the excessive delay in production of the second season, as it was shown three years after the first season, in addition to the extremely poor CGI. The bottom line is that this work is really good. If you are patient with it and its dialogues, it will give you what you want, but it could have been iconic, but at the same time remember that there is no complete work.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
There was whole plot lines skipped and scenes that where missing. Definitely some work that was needed in the editing department. Characters would pop up from nowhere even thou there will miles away. Ending created more questions than answers.....CGI was done Okay for a series.The acting was fantastic with each character having their own interesting story.Overall I finished the series which is a achievement on its own so it could hold my attention long enough not to start something else since you are spoiled for choice on Netflix.I would recommend Sweet Home to those who likes the zombie genre but be warned this is not your typical zombie/monster series. Much more a slow burner drama with some action now and again.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Don't bother with positive comments from webtoon fans, or the bad critics, this series is really cool.
and it worth every second of your life
the ones who disliked it just didn't understand the series, or didn't even complete it, prob just a stupid brains,
I CAN SAY NOW, THAT I'll DIE HAPPY NOW !
just waiting for season 2 now, hopeful it will be amazing as season 1
it just get 1.4 Billion views from the world, do you what it means ?, it's a really 2ufh29ef9e2fo;2efjifwuf9weu just watch it or die !",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I was so disappointed with an episode 7 everything was so good and great until It added the bad cgi and random monster battle's and what not the acting was good atmosphere is amazing like the costuming and the placement is perfect and stirring the I read this before I watched this on Netflix but the CGI oh my God so bad.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The acting and special effects are great, top notch",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
This series was great! I would give it more stars if the last couple episodes didn't seem so rushed... I'm stating to read the Webtoons it's based on to make sense of it all and the Webtoons is way better hands down!,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I suppose that if you haven't read the comic or the webtoon you're will be quite lost watching this. Unfortunately this series is plagued by a bad script, empty annoying characters and ridiculous plot. The worst thing has to be the horrible music. Is this an action or a horror? Had hoped for the latter but the music destroys any atmosphere. Save your time.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean science fiction, horror drama with 10, 44-59 minute episodes.An introvert after extreme bullying, teenager Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kant) loses his entire family in a car accident. Despondent and suicidally depressed, Hyun-soo moves into a large apartment building and continues his life of solitude. That is until strange things begin occurring in the building and he and his neighbors must rely on each other to survive. Something is causing people to turn into horrible, blood thirsty, destructive monsters and it is hard to know who to trust. Martial law is declared throughout South Korea but this little micro chasm of humanity must endure and fight both the monsters within as well as out.Cha Hyun-soo (Song Kang). A teenager who lost the will to live after losing his entire family, finds himself in a hell like existence where humans turned monster roam about and it is hard to know who to trust. Winds up becoming part monster but is able to control it giving him superhuman powers.Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook) no one is quite sure who he is but he is willing to do what others will not and punish evil doers as he sees fit. He looks rough and gangster like in appearance with a heavily scarred face. He is abnormally strong and ruthless.See Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young) a character created for the drama (not webtoon) she is an expert martial artist who served in special forces and was also a fire fighter. After her fianc챕 vanished mere sprays before their wedding, she has trust issues.Lee Eun-hyuk (Lee Do-Hyundan) is th self designated leader of the group of survivors whose cold rationality makes his leadership strong but cause there's to consider him unfeeling. He is a medical student and older brother to Lee Eun-yoo (Go Min-si) a former ballerina who has a chip on her shoulder as she had to quit due to an injury.Jung Jae-heon (Kim Nam-hee) A devout Christian who wields a sword, Normally a mild mannered Korean language teacher, he is diligent and fearless in the defense of others.Yoon Ji-soo (Park Gyu-young) After her boyfriend's suicide, she moves into the building and tries to keep to herself and keep her bass guitar playing from annoying others.Park Yoo-ri, (Go Yoon-jung) is a caregiver for one of the apartment's residents and her medical knowledge is a valuable asset to the group of survivors who are frequently injured while battling the monsters.Ahn Gil-seob Kim Kap-soo) he is recklessly brave as he is terminally-ill. Park Yoo-ri Is his caregiver and knows his grumpy facade hides his caring nature.Han Du-sik (Kim Sang-ho) Former military man with skill in creating weapons. Although bound to a wheelchair his a kill with weapons makes him an invaluable member of the group..
Kim Suk-hyun (Woo Hyun) is both mentally and physically abusive to his wife. He owns a grocery but is reluctant to share food even in the apocalyptic scenario. He frequently creates tension in the group.Ahn Sun-young (Kim Hyun) She is meek and beaten down as Suk-hyun's wife. The group supper gives her the strength to stand up to him.Cha Jin-ok (Kim Hee-jung) continued attempts to open the door and escape in order to locate and save her teen daughter repeatedly puts the group in jeopardy.Kim Su-yeongm ((HeoYool) is a small child (9 Years Old) who along with her brother Kim Yeong-su (Choi Go; 6-year-old) lost their father when he was attacked by a monster while attempting to repel down the side of the building to get them food.Son Hye-in (Kim Gook-hee) considers her Pomerania; Bom, like her child and continually carries it.Im Myung-sook (Lee Bong-ryun) devastated since losing her child when the baby's stroller got loose and rolled into traffic.Choi Yoon-jae (Go Geon-Han) pretends to be kind to hide among the group from Sang-wook. But he is a human monster of another sort, a Child Predator.If Movies in the horror genre are your thing then this will likely fit the bill. The monsters were definitely scary and horrific and the fact that the people turn into monsters was in and of itself frightening . That type of transformation was reminiscent of the American movie ""The Thing"" though only vaguely so. It was interesting the way the people both had to work together while not completely trusting each other to be able to make it through. I liked that there was that central character, the teenage boy, and that he was unique and that he had the monster in him yet was largely able to control it. The series was well paced throughout most of it until towards the end when it got a little chaotic and felt like a lot of people were dying very rapidly. There were also aspects that were not well explained such as why the fire fighter character was suddenly with the military at the very end. The fact that she was working with them had been revealed earlier but it did not seem like she had given them what they wanted enough that she would've been able to join them completely. The gangster guy was very different in the television series than in the webtoon where he was more of a goofy character and much more likable. For the most part they stuck to the webtoon enough that it was clear that it was made based on it and yet deviated enough to make it work in the television format. They left it open for more seasons as everything was not wrapped up and in the fact there is additional story line in the webtoon indicates that there is story left for more episodes to the series or another season. I'm not sure why they decided to only do 10 episodes, 16 or more episodes would have allowed for a more complete telling of the story.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"A brilliant and we'll written script, with mostly original monsters. You get to feel for the characters throughout, and the way they care for each other and overcome challenges is a treat to watch. Highly recommended!",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This is better than most English language horror/monster shows by far the characters might not be incredible but the production value and monster design is incredible I've not seen anything this good looking outside of American cinema even the monsters in stranger things look terrible compared to this.
Even if you hate reading subtitles or whatever this rises above the rest it doesn't drag there's not too much talking so give it a go.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"It's Good(Webtoon was awesome great) that there are extra characters introduce in the flix version all Good , Actors were good also but I hope you don't change the Relationship of the characters as you See Ji su was the one in Webtoon to bring Hyunsu to human form when struggle with his monster form however in this Series version there was soo less value given to Jisu it looked more like she is just one of the other survivor fighting for the surviving, which highly is not acceptable.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Really enjoyed this drama both season 1 and 2.Season 2 really kept you on the edge of your seat towards the end. I liked that we got to see more of the other characters and what their stories were.Loved that in this season they also uped the thriller/horror parts it's what kept you wanting to see what happened next.The fact that ji-su also died so early on was a buzz kill as I really liked her character so think it was silly to kill her off, although she killed it in the few minutes we did see her.Yi kyung was also brilliant! But again wished we saw more of her also. Also more of her action scenes could've been great too.I personally think Sangwook also needed more scenes because it would've been more interesting to see him switch between the two personas but sadly we didn't.Eun yoo, felt like the whole of season two was about her and honestly it almost got boring , she was extremely reckless and immature and it always cost others and made the story seem like it was dragging.Lastly Cha Hyun Soo (Song Kang) as one of the male leads why did we only see him for 4 episodes? And only like 10 mins in those 4 episodes?! It was really disappointing we saw so little of him because we didn't really see where his story goes or could go. Hopefully in season 3 we see more of him.In conclusion it was a good season would definitely recommend watching but wish we saw more of the ENTIRE main cast members that survived.Excited for season 3 because Eun Hyuk makes a comeback too!!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
The only two bad thing in this show is bad cgi and that warriors lol theme popping every badass scene happened every other thing is good and i really cant wait for season 2,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
It sounds like this was a webtoon series n the people giving the series a low rating r those who have already read the webtoon .I havent read the webtoon n dont plan to SO please just watch it for it's sake! n dont spoil it for those who r not into webtoons,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This would have made a good three hour movie, but it had too much time to get lost in itself. By the seventh episode or so I was losing interest, but stayed with it until the end, which provided no resolution at all.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I give Sweet Home a 9/10. It's definitely worth watching for fans of the horror genre. The main character is both overpowered and has inner problems he needs to deal with to hold the power, which makes for an exciting and dynamic story. The monsters, which have a Resident Evil-style aesthetic, are unique and intriguing. They aren't good or bad, just people, as they should be. While I did start to feel a bit drowsy near the end of the first season, the ending was enough to wake me up. However, the ending was a bit of a letdown, but it sets up an intriguing premise for a potential continuation of the story.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"In a word - EPIC! And yes, watch it to the end. Can't wait for Season 2...",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I watched the whole thing a few months ago, and now I'm watching it again! There's just something about this series that I love. The actors. The special effects. The story. It's very original and fresh. I am thrilled that there's going to be a 2nd season! You never know if Netflix is going to cancel a good show or not. Sweet Home, and Sweet Tooth are definitely GOOD SHOWS! IMO.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Found this while looking through Netflix and I absolutely loved it!!!While some of the effects are rudimentary, they do not take away from the field of the movie. The cast and characters are well developed and set up. Story is interesting, you find yourself identifying and relating to the different characters.This also makes a lot of very good points about how a Korean society would have difficulty facing such a world ending situation. Where I am from we are accustomed to access to guns and other weapons - but how do you survive when citizens do not have access to such things and a single sword is the strongest weapon your group has for survival.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"One of the worst things I have ever seen. Horrible characters, annoying to the core, terrible soundtrack and special effects. This was definitely the stuff of nightmares... production nightmares. I don't understand how anyone could watch more than one episode, the opening scene alone is just awful. This is just a weird show that has no real reason for existing and is all over the place. Couldn't even make to episode three. Hated this, its just loud and ugly and random. Tried to sit and give it another try, nope... its not happening.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"If you were to take every 90's classic horror game, an 80's B horror movie that is so bad it's good, have it made in Korea, and turn it into a TV show this would be the outcome.Watched the first episode, and it's so bad but can't seem to stop watching it.If someone turned this into a video game I would buy it.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I could not stop watching until it was the end of the last episode. So much is not expected, which kept me on the edge of my seat. It's a bit insulting to even compare this to anything in the zombie genre.It exciting, frightening, heart warming, and action packed.Wow! Please, please, please let there be a second season.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"""Sweet Home"" is a South Korean fantasy horror directed by masterful Lee Eung Bok. This show is about a group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing, so this is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it category. Monsters are unique and extremely hard to kill with some pretty terrifying cosmetics and fairly basic CGI. The series overall is visually stunning with many disturbing scenes akin to the Evil Dead franchise. The narrative is very disjointed, difficult to follow, and not very engaging, but the show is addictive and a bloody feast to watch.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I really enjoyed Sweet Home. It's an urban disaster series which you'll think is initially going to be zombie-esque, but the producers take zombie apocalypses to a new level with a monster brand. It's frightening, funny and there's never a dull moment.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Just finished episode 5 and I don't know whether to continue, how this show is even getting at least 6 star rating from some people surprises me or does it get better after episode 6?
the plot line is such a bore and the monsters! my God the monsters are so awful, who ever designed them is such an idiot, none of the monsters make sense to me! then there's the action scenes where its like it's skipping, pathetic! you barely know what happened and too many characters to keep up with, it's like every episode has a new character introduced. so much cringe in this show.
I would rather watch romance kdrama than this bore fest and that says a lot",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'm looking forward to the rest, it's a very nice series",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Both in story and acting, this series is superb. One moment you are holding your breath as the action explodes, then there's an unmoveable lump in your throat as one or more of the beautiful characters as killed, then, without warning, you are smiling or even laughing!Visual effects are second to none, every actor is top class and the plot is a mindtwister! If this is not renewed for at least a second season, then may all at Netflix suffer the fate of Ms An!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The series is emotionally a little low, there is only love in 3 characters, but in general, every part is extremely good and fun, there are no empty monsters, new monsters, new features are coming in all sections, you definitely won't regret watching the 2nd season, I recommend a great series :)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I just completed season 1 and I can tell you that each episode left my jaw on the floor. It's unusual to see people realistically go through their point of absolute breaking with horror. The acting was superb and the plot twists incredible. I'm seriously just in awe.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"If you were looking foward to this and have read the webtoon I have to break it to you that its bad. The cgi is terrible the monsters are more comedic than scary the visuals are just bad in general, this concept and story was not meant for live action at all they should of just done a animation instead of live action the story is ok definitely not exactly the same as the webtoon of course. Netflix just needs to stop making live action series and films of good comics or animes it just does not work havent they learned this already I guess apparently not Just dont watch it not worth anyones time just read the webtoon or watch something else",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
The show I must admit does start slow but you will slowly see all these story elements come together in an amazingly creative way. You will grow attached to a lot of these characters due to the show's commitment to explaining their characters throughly. The actual monsters themselves are extremely creative and I'm surprised how many there are in these 10 episodes. The only downfall of this show has to be the GCI of some of the monsters. Others are extremely well made due to the show's commitment to makeup but others just have a look that can break immersion. Overall please don't sleep on this show and hopefully season 2 is on its way! A true revolution in horror TV!,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I can't wait for a second season. I have a lot of unanswered questions and I can't wait to see what's going to happen next!,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
From the trailer i was unsure if I'd like the plot of the story but let me tell you the serie is phenomenal!!! It captiveted me from start to finish. Never throughout the story did i feel that it was boring and i wanted to skip a part like i usually do. 10/10 recommend you to give it a chance. It feels like the storyline was very well thought through. Might be because it's based on a webtoon.If you generally don't like horror movies you might still like the serie. It isn't that scary. The is a lot of blood though.If you overcome your perhaps existing dislike of movies with subtitles i'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised with how good it is:),positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The world-building and the characters are excellent. I love every role that is in the series. They did a great job. The story itself is nice although, I am not a fan of what happened in the last part. You can say that there will be a Season 2 for this. It is a super cliff-hanger, or maybe I am only hoping for a happy ending for this?I love the scene when Hyun Su totally became a monster, and the Uncle character that made their weapons hugged him to calm Hyun Su. I really thought it would be one of the cures for special-infected monsters. Some more confusions and answers are not yet resolved, so Season 2 is an excellent way to wrap it up.I hate that Lee Do Hyun's character died :(((( He's one of the reasons why there are survivors, yet he didn't survive. I hope he'll also appear if ever there's a Season 2.Overall, I loved it despite its flaws. I am looking forward to series like this one.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Might not be for everyone.
The story line isn't in chronological order so you have to think for yourself I really like that but not everyone thinks the same",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The first episode is a masterpiece and I was positively impressed by the camera angles they used to film the series, they made everything more intriguing. The character introductions, their interactions with one another seem somewhat out of this world but realistic nevertheless.Reading the reviews I see both the ones praising it and the ones trashing it have 50-70% helpfulness and to be honest it's well deserved: what I disliked was the show turning more ""basic"" as it went one and monsters becoming less and less common. It still managed to stay a solid good show until the end but the drop in quality is noticeable especially between the 1st and the rest of the episodes. They need to learn from The Walking Dead and not repeat their mistakes.The CGI is painfully obvious and some of the scenes may disturb the immersion, they really need to bump up the budget for the 2nd season. I also think that Warriors by Imagine Dragons shouldn't have been in this series, it didn't truly fit any scenes in which it was used and made me cringe a little, an original soundtrack would've been much better.I'm torn between giving a 7 or an 8 but since I feel like I have withdrawal symptoms and it has me longing for a second season I'll give it an 8.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Amazing series zombies and monsters i love them and I think it's great for people.,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The first season was fantastic and I couldn't wait for the 2nd. Sadly, it is nothing but arguing and insult after insult. Nearly every character is a horrible person and frankly, I don't care who lives or dies. They're all awful. This series has got to set some kind of record for insults and name calling. It's most of the dialogue. Nearly every scene has someone degrading someone else. It's absolutely pointless and does nothing but irritate, without it, this would be shrunk down to a couple of episodes. I love Korean shows and movies but this 2nd season it just awful. The gun manufacturer advertisement and product placement is beyond the pale and an insult. I hope they're proud of themselves for this monstrosity.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"It's just purely AMAZING!!!
truly all-star A-class casts!! Loved how each character really shines and really well depicted. The nuance of emotions is so well done.amazing CG!!!! The monsters are very carefully depicted and I can see how much they invested in this! AMAZING!!!!!I love the story itself, which is prob the best part! It doesn't exactly follow the webtoon, but I love how it keeps the core and tells the story in a more cinematic way. I particularly love the part about how you fight against your desire / us and them.Really look forward to season 2! (Hope there is one!)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

But highly recommend this",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"So it seems that the show kind of let down the manga fans who complain about the adaptation. Well, who cares.This was a fun, bingeworthy show with an excellent ensemble cast and more character development than in 30 episodes series. You just need a manga lens to get used to the silliness of some of the monsters, but as the show progresses we get less of that and more of human interactions.Still, a potential viewer must be warned that there's no explanation why that plague has befallen Seoul (and probably the world), there's no clear ending and probably no season 2. Just so you know.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
1st episode started off decent but the effects look like a stop motion claymation movie with the budget of 100 dollars and the music is chosen very badly at times not including the fact that the outside and the parking lot look like a haunted house you would find on your street during Halloween also some of the monsters look like edward scissor hands and leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre lol it was laughable at many part i would consider it more of a comedy only thing that is good about this is the acting but even that can't save it from coming off as incredibly cheesy can't believe it's rated so high what were they watching?,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"There are pros and cons for everything but this show is something else, I enjoyed this show so much that I even took a leave from my office just to finish it. Intense action in first season to drama in 2nd.Everything is perfect apart from CGI in first season which was not that bad but season 2 made up for it, it's too good. The side characters are also good in their performance, there was sometimes where I thought about cursing the villains so I can say they played a good role.All things apart this show is 9/10 for me.TRUST ME TRY TO SEE AT LEAST 2 EPISODES, YOU WILL GET HOOKED TO THIS SHOW ?삆?삆",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The show is actually very good oh, and goes much deeper than you would expect. Visually good and well written. Sure on the outside it looks like a monster flick but it's what's on the inside. Everybody has monsters living inside them screaming out. Would you like to be your monster, yes.....no. Would you kill? Can you survive?",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"There is a lot to like though, acting is mostly on point, where it wasn't was scenes where a character was lil over the top in complaining. Story is very intriguing and I would definitely like to see where it goes after season 1. CGI hit and miss some of it was so realistic then at other times or different part of the CGI effect it would seem like stop motion style and or janky animations. But good enough to propel the story.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"What a bunch of crap baseless story that completely ruined the hype of the Og concept. Almost all characters from S1 are gone. Main character gets less screen time. Monsters with unique abilities are turned into zombies with 0 creativity, some of them turned into cheap transformers. New characters with no background, no story. Focused on army who has no idea with that they are doing. I don't even know what was the concept for this story.Don't even dare to like any single character, he'll be dead in the next moment. So many cliffhangers. I bingewatched s1, and it gave me vibes like Alice in Borderland that raised my hype for s2 even more. But it was totally disappointing.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I don't write reviews but this one is under rated. This show is different , no silent promotions. Lot of unique characters showing different shades. In start, you think this is zombie show, but wait for it. It is not bang-bang , zombie killing bloody show. This one has good and meaningful pauses. Showing how different characters behave under panic and attack. It was impressive show with good special effect and mystery. Eagerly waiting for SEASON -2. Acting wise Lee Jin-Wook playing gangster is memorable .Don't miss this one.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Season one was soo good. Most characters were good. But no they had to just ruin it in season 2 and keep the most annoying girl from season one alive. Eun-yoo has nothing to offer in the story. She is a petty heroine with tough girl act. That's it. On most cases she can't do anthing uself other then put on a tough girl act. What was the creator thinking? They killed off all the characrers that made the season 1 so interesting. They should have made a more compaling heroine. Season 2 seems like it is not going anywhere. The story is quite blend. I loved the season 1 and seen the whole season with full attention. But with season 2 I had to skip most parts.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"At first I wasn't even planning on watching this because of course netflix would ruin it, I was dead wrong. This is one of the best ""netflix originals"" full stop. Blows every live action adaptation they've made of ANYTHING out the water so far you can see it from space. Does the source material an amazing justice and really brings to light just how bad that apartment complex looked to live in. Not a single bad casting call, even the normally awful CG looks great. Even when the cg is ""bad"" it still fits the tone of what the monsters are supposed to be. Could not have asked for a better job to have been done.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Well written believable characters that develop throughout the series, which is not to common in this genre. You actually care about these characters. Cgi is not the best since the budget of this series was not big, but it's good enough to generate suspense and 1000 times better than what I grew up with (tried rewatching some cgi dependant from my childhood, I remembered them as almost real but to my surprise with today's standards they are horrible, my video games look better).I would rate this series 8.5/10 (but I'll put 10 here to balance some of the very bad reviews that does not make this series justice)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I am caucasian and I LOVE this show. This is only my second review on any media. I had to review it because is is so good! Yes, I rated it 10. And no it's not an exaggeration. I have rules. For me, a good show is a seven. A great show as an eight. No one gets a nine unless I felt the need to watch it twice. And the only shows/movies that get a 10 are things that I have watched three times or more. (Which I can count on one hand. Ok if you include, the office I guess it's 2 hands. I wasn't really thinking about comedies).In fact, after I completed the first season, I immediately watched it again because I wanted more. That has pretty much never happened to me. I usually wait a while in between repeating something. But it was so good I could not.So why do I like the show so much? It's a fun and new take on the genre. But most importantly, it actually builds characters. People that you actually care about, It's amazing at that. Yes the creatures are a little out there. But there is a plot reason for that. I actually think it makes it fun. I can't remember a time when I watched a show like this that made me cry. It made me feel all the feels because the character building was so good. Not something you expect in a show like this.If you are not Korean, definitely watch with subtitles it's much better. And If you can just relax and let the show take you to where it is going, it is a very enjoyable ride!!I really hope the creators do another season (or several) this is truly an amazing show!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Idk what to say
i had really high expectations , great cast , amazing webtoon ,
if anyone read the webtoon they will get me
i felt like watching that bad movie ""adaptation"" of deathnote. :(
that was so poorly done ,
the graphics/cgi was bad ,
the acting was so lame ,
eventhough it has a great cast all of them in previous performances r gr8 !
tbh i don't recomend this at all
read the webtoon bttr .",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Don't let the bad reviews stop you from watching this excellent series; watch the series and decide for yourself.
I thought it was fantastic!
I'd say it's a cross between, The Mist Stephen King and the Japanese horror The Eye, with a selection of brilliant monsters of differing types, all excellently created and animated.
The dubbing was good with the characters voices well cast too.
Love each character's personalities, with a little humour thrown in for good measure, but not too much as to spoil the horror, gore and fear factor.
I think it's great that Netflix is bringing some excellent Eastern creativity to the West.
I'd say thank you Netflix and well done to the creators.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

I really loved the theme of this series. Being agoraphobic I can totally relate to this series. It would be interesting to know how the would became cronanberg in a short time.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I heard that this is one of the biggest Netflix blockbuster this year with $2.4M each episode so i thought it's gonna be some big thing, but turn out a mess.
Bad CGI, bad acting, bad soundtrack, the monsters look cheap and fake, it would make you laugh more than scare, and there is no depth in the content. It would be ok if this was just a random trash movie,... I am not expecting to see this from a big hyped project.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Superb series, some needless dialogue , but overall very good. Main character struggle is great, the CGI is good, the monster threat can take several iterations with the Evolution introduced, plus the Monster take on experiment with humans, gives some Guyver vibes, those anime subtle references add a very nice touch to the series, and make room for Future more powerful enemies to deal with, as Humanity slowly erodes away. Plus while not mentioned, they could introduce other places in the world that have survivors, and can make contact and share resources to survive the current crisis. This alone provides potential for more seasons, plus plenty of gore, action, a winner so far.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Me and my partner had been watching another excellent Korean Series Kingdom which also hangs in the balance of being renewed by Netflix and transitioning to this was a bit jarring at first. The characters were cartoony, the music at times (certainly in the first few episodes) seemed a little ill judged. As the season progresses however and certainly after epsiode 3 we started to become hooked and by the end we had a very much fully fledged set of dynamic characters. The slightly naff K-pop (Sorry if you're a fan) had started to be toned down (by episode 3) and the ending to the series felt like you'd be taken on a real emotional ride with the comic book, almost Scott Pilgrim esque feel, had been completely eradicated. Funny, clever and some solid acting, I urge you to stick with it and you will be rewarded. Let's hope Netflix do the sensible thing and bring it back for more.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Please do not pay attention to the people who read the webtoon. This series is perfect and I can see it getting way better in the upcoming seasons. The writer did not shy from providing the most authentic realistic flow of events possible even when it hurt. I enjoyed the lead in this series. His state of mind fits the mood. Overall, an incredible work. I can't wait for season 2.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I really love Comic version, but this TV series is so horrible.... they changed it to comedy with total awkward parts,....",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
If this was an American series it would get torn apart and all you have to do is look at the ratings of any of similar shows that have been on TV other than WD or AHS and even those are have lower overall ratings. An anti American bias by Americans taints every bit of pop culture this gets a boost it deserves simply by it not coming from the US. I love this show it's not only a great horror show it's also an excellent mystery and has spots of comic relief. The story the acting the pace and its presentation are all excellent and while the CGI is not the best it's good enough that it's not unintentionally funny.,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
This is not only thriller. Thriller+Emotion+twist=Sweet Home.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I was on my toes the whole time; there was always so much going on. At first it was a bit overwhelming, being introduced to so many characters, but I really like getting to know each and every one of them. Almost none of the characters nor scenes bored me.The concept of the show is pretty captivating. People are turning into monsters left and right, and one doesn't know when someone will turn. The residents of a certain building construct a small society in order to protect themselves, and shenanigans ensue.
I do feel like the show could be a bit confusing at times, not showing us or not finishing showing us what someone was doing or what is going on with them. It's still not very clear exactly how someone turns into a monster, so I wish the show was clearer on that. I also do wish we got to delve into more of some characters, since they were great, but there were so many of them. But I suppose there was only a certain amount of time for everything, and though I would've liked the season or the episodes to be longer to clarify the plot more and explore the characters more, I feel like the show still did good enough. Either way, that just leaves space for more clarity and character background and development next season, which I really hope will come.This show made me think a lot (What's to come next? Who can be trusted? Who's the real monster here? Will they turn into one?), and it did make me feel pain at certain points. But it was so worth it.The music was also really good, especially BeWhy's OST, Side by Side. I've seen some people complain about the use of Warriors by Imagine Dragons, but honestly, I think it was fine.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Yeah, GJ to our Korean movie-makers. Effects & montage are fine, horror component is a fact, with proper thriller and stuff. I know you 're most likely gonna' like the series, especially if you like the horror, thriller & action genre. Tbh, it wasn't exactly in my type of movies. WIth this I mean, I really 'd feel better if there was more monster action as the drama, the interpersonal relationships, crimi, etc aren't among the things that provoke interest in me, but, well, different people, different points of view. You can check out the series on Netflix, and if you like the first 2-3 episodes, then you'd like the rest, too. You will partial find similarity to the Gantz movies, the feeling can be somewhat close, but I guess this is just Asian style, and it feels good. I hope there 'll be season two on Netflix to check out.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The actors are doing a great job, casting is amazing. That is the only reason this show doesn't get 1/10. The main show however is slow as dirt, every episode is the same. You can actually skip several episodes and not miss out on the overall plot. (Episode 5-7 are just fillers)
The first episode was interesting and had potential, but then it's just the same story line over and over again. Monsters appear when the plot demands it and humans squabble over useless things. Like a monster that is 3 metre tall and weighs 200 kilo somehow appears INSIDE the building, despite being shown outside in the first episode, and somehow got in without making a single sound despite him having to break down walls in order to move his huge body around the corridors.
In the end you just find yourself waiting for the show to end, you don't care about the characters at all.This show is unfortunately a huge waste of time. There are many good Korean shows, but this is not one of them.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
First of all I loved the monster theme of it and how it's not just like all the other zombie to show and movies. The episodes get really long tho and sometimes I just wanted to fast foreword. The monster are amazing and the characters are great and I really hope season two will come back! I hope there will be more monsters in the future and I hope there will be more characters too!,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

I like this so much. i just want to protect hyun su at all cost... i love all the characters and it was so sad when they were gone one by one. the whole turning into a monster things is a bit confusing but it's also interesting how one would turn into something they desire the most... i can't wait for the season 2!!,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"Imagine the most miserable, unlikeable people on earth stuck in a residential building while random monsters go around with zero explanation.The monsters are pretty cool but the characters kill it.

Who wants to look at these imbeciles.Pass.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I have no idea why there are so many haters reviewing this series (especially the ones who didn't even watch it all) I thought it was great. The monsters are very cool, well done CG critters, and while not all of them are original, the eye-guy and gremlin-alike listener monsters were awesome. The characters aren't all great, but the way that they're narrowed down to the ones which are genuinely interesting is really quite well done.It's not a series for everyone, but if you can bring yourself to watch to the end of the first episode, you'll have a lot of fun.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Aswell as great Monsters, makes this a Netflix Korean Hit not to be missed.The ending was a tad confusing, however I am sure I get it.
The only real critism I have is That the writers literally killed off every amazing character, which I was kinda bummed about.
I will also say, if you like the other Korean TV show ""Kingdom"" You will love this.
8/10 Can't wait for S02",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Mmmh.. I had doubts about the series at first, because I was very confused with Song Kang's character. But as it progresses I became more interested, then I started understanding the whole monsters outside the building thing. Great acting from the cast but Song Kang takes the cherry on top of the cake: HE'S SO GOOD. He portrayed the character really well. Do-hyun was also amazing. Pretty nice so far, and would be better if there is season 2. Hopefully there is, because it ended in a slight mediocre fashion, but still not mediocre enough to drag the series down. Congrats to the Sweet Home team for their success!",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The webtoon was really amazing and i enjoyed it through out the entire series. But when it got adapted, it became super lame story. So many great characters got deleted from existence. On top of that, the pacing was super slow, heck, even slower than a snail. The main character does not even feel like he is the main character. Instead, the side characters feels more like the MC. How is that even possible? I swear the MC literally has like 30 minutes of screen time in THE ENTIRE SERIES. Furthermore, the character development in this series abosolutely close to zero. NONE! I seriously don't understand how this drama even got higher rating than 3. K-drama watchers are delusional.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

If you like zombie and horror then you will love.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Show is great, not as the webtoon but still great. Some monsters are really bad makeup artists made, like a nurse with syringes on her nipples, really?! Thank God the main mosters are not like that. The only big con is the song selection, korean trap song and imagine dragons, literally, a stupid song of imagine dragon in the best moments of the series, completely destroys immersion. Probably should have gine the soundtrack selection to someone else.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The suspense at the end was great. Should get a second season. The series built the story quickly. This could have been more subtle. It held all the stories together but we're a bit here n there.

"Honestly, it's difficult to write a good plot and script for any zombie film. Still, I think they did a great job with this. Coming from a gamer geek, the variations in the zombie were really quite interesting to me. The struggle of facing the sudden apocalyptic crisis is well-portrayed in the story and by the cast. I honestly find most zombie films too boring and predictable, but this series was like a K version of Resident Evil - in a good way. Definitely worth watching. The start can get a little draggy - as all zombie films tend to be but don't give up just yet!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Turned out better than I expected. probably among the best netflix of 2020,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I tried so hard to like this one and for the first few episodes I was enjoying it for the most part as the story showed promise but I just couldn't relate to a single character. They are mostly emotionless and just have zero sympathy for anything. It's kinda awkward to watch and extremely frustrating at times. The monsters were pretty cool and they're all I really stayed for in the end but they're appearances were way too far and few between. I personally got on and am getting on a lot better with Squid Game (finished) and Alice in Borderland (1 episode in),negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"The trailer caught my eye so I went into watching this show with confusion and man it did not disappoint! I binged the 10 episodes in two days. Monsters/Thriller type of shows are my thing and Sweet Home brought all of that into this first season!Each characters has their own agendas and the character building was captured well that you end up enjoying the characters individually as well as when they get together as a group. The emotional turmoil that I had for the main characters and the supporting role was overwhelming. I find myself attached and crying over certain storylines and scenes and it was sooo good!The show really give you the, 'what type of a human you want to be when you are stuck in a dire situation?' and I felt that.The whole cast overall was superb in their given role and the ending was just such a cliff that I wish season 2 was released now so I can binge through it too lol.Give this show a chance! The pacing is really good and the suspense, oh man the suspense!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I haven't knew anything about the webtoon (still don't), i just saw the Netflix trailer and thought i'd give it a go, since a like horror and korean movies.
The first 3 episodes were great for my taste (good atmosphere, setting and the monsters were awesome, especially their variety and quirks), the last 3 were great and the middle 4 episodes or so war a bit too slow, with nothing much happening in terms of action, which was a bit of a let down considering the first episodes set the expectations for me.
Overall, really worth a watch, although i would've liked for the middle episodes keep up the tone of the first ones.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Another L for monster movie/show lovers. Producers/writers/directors cant seem to get it right with this genre of shows anymore and every 10 shows made, 9 of them are pretty disappointing. Yes, I'm talking about the failure of Monarch Legacy of Monsters as well.You want a good monster show? Watch Gyeongseong creature instead.Sweet Home S2 was like, malicious defiance. They have source material to put to screen, instead they go offrail on this messy path where they try to make a sidestory the main plot. So only the first 3 episodes pick up from S1, then its a completely different story, they killed off most of the S1 characters that we want to see or took away most of their screen time, introduced more factions that add more confusion.A lot of supposed critical parts of the plot are not explained. For example, what happened to the monsters now becoming generic, cookie cutter replicas, no longer the unique mutated human-monsters that we saw in S1.The S2 cliffhanger ending was really bad, cliche and cringey and testament to incompetency of the writing/directing efforts (Why precisely that person, and the process was also not explained).**Abit of spoilers**The doctor also supposedly had a cure but it somehow became irrelevant, instead he brought a luggage out for no reason, randomly found a monster egg (?) when he wanted to poop, just nice had his empty luggage he brought randomly that had could perfectly fit the big specimen...

"God damn I enjoyed this show the monsters, the charecters, the conflict and mmmm that imagine dragons song just boosts how truly epic the moments on this show areI particularly enjoy that they show off the deformed almost eldritch monsters are in this show it annoys me to the extreme when we see little bits of monsters or they are hidden in shadows or dim lighting in shows so it's always a good time when a show goes balls to the wall crazy with their monsters (that is the main attraction to shows like this)",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Most of the time I was completely engrossed in the storytelling..... and though the ending threw me off a little.... I definitely do not regret watching it. I gave it 8/10 because it is one of the better horror/fantasy films that I have seen in awhile.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

But I don쨈t like the thing that it has got open ending so you have to wait on the season 2 that is going to be on netflix sometime in 2023 but I don쨈t know exactly when. But I am still so excited because it is one of my favourite TV series. But I still give the series 10 stars because it is very elaborated and kinda creepy sometimes but not that much.

"I laughed to myself a little at the review that said the episodes ""fell off"" a bit after the first few, the reason being that they weren't being dazzled by the mutating beings anymore and had to use cognitive skills and follow a story. On the other hand, if there wasn't a story, then we would have the other half of the crowd whining and moaning that there was no story, just brutes in all fashions fighting non stop, which is great for some story, but, I want to be on the edge of my seat for real things, I want to watch people struggle as they see signs of their own infection. I want to see people turn on each other and likewise fight for one another as they see people they have come to care about become infected. This show was SO much fun, it doesn't follow the same recipe of, destroy the head, destroy the being, one bite turns you etc. That' was SO refreshing, THIS is why I love watching Korean and Chinese dramas, I find more unique stories. Sure, there are tropes to be seen, but it's not always the same over and over and this show is a great example. I am blown away that the ratings aren't higher on this series.

"Let me tell you guys something. When I first saw this series pop up in Netflix, I was like hell nah, it looked to stupid. Then over and over and over again I would come across this series. So one day I said, ""man look, since it keep popping up, let me take a look at it."" I watched the entire show within 2 days. That is how good it is. I would have watched it within a day, but I started it in the night. I am sooooo glad this series kept popping up, because I am very picky when it comes to shows and movies, as I am a horror, sci-fy, mystery, comedy, anime and cartoon person. So when I can say I highly recommend this series to people, best believe it has to be hell a good. Now that season two is out, it started off with bare action already and that is just the first episode. This is a series I will continue to watch over and over again. I pray that it continues to have season after season. Don't by pass this one guys, just try it and see. By the middle of the second episode, not only will you not take your eyes off the tv, but you will laugh your ass off at some of the scenes. Enjoy guys its a really great one. Also go in with an open mind. If you want a clue on what to expect, its like ""The Mist"" but without the Mist. Lol pun intended.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This drama is not perfect. The CGI monsters are so bad that they are almost comical. The plot is messy and can be confusing.However, where this drama succeed is in character development. Many of the characters are unlikeable in the beginning but as the story progresses, they become more relatable. Most of the characters are given enough time to show that they are multifaceted. And by the time some of these characters gets killed off, you actually feel the lose. Another thing the drama achieved is leaving a sense of hope, the idea that people will survive any adversity if they all band together.As strange as this may sound, despite its dark gloomy setting, this drama is a feel good drama.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I've not read the source material if it matters.The plot isn't anything special, but it isn't bad. Execution is overall terrible, tho.CGI was god awful for this day and age. Guessing it's from low budget, but that doesn't make it any better to look at.The worst cinematography I've ever seen. There were part of scenes that were missing entirely, honestly didn't it was possible for this to happen. Scenes would get so chopped up that you wouldn't be able to tell what just happened.If you don't like Imagine Dragons stay away from this show, every episode has a dose of them, makes the corny moments even cornier.And yes, show is overly corny at times and the acting can get terrible.Please take my review in to consideration. I never though a piece of entertainment could be this bad and make me wonder how anyone could enjoy it.

Story of this webseries is pretty good but VFX are totally rubbish please improve VFX in season 2 I'm excited for it. This is the most underrated series their main cause is VFX. You can definitely watch this show it's awesome.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I was browsing Netflix and I saw Sweet Home and I decided to check it out. Wasn't so sure abt it after the first episode. But, I continued to watch the series and by the end of ep-2. I was hooked! I just finished it. It's one of the best series on Netflix. You should def check it out.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"After watching Squid Game and Alice in Borderland I thought this would be something similarly great.But when I heard the line ""Go commit suicide somewhere else"" I was like wow, this is introducing garbage characters from episode one. And of course, the main character just takes it.And that's just it, the entire thing relies too heavily on the characters, but most of them are forgettable trash, and nothing too interesting happens to get you invested.It's all confusing too, I had to search online for explanations as to what happened exactly, since even after watching the final episode I was confused.So yeah, surprisingly disappointing.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Okay, this is the Deal, if you have watched Train to Busan, that zombie movie...well this one makes that Train ride, look like Cinderella. The story is intense, the pace like a rollercoaster ride in hell, the blood and gore by the buckets, the photography equals anything Hollywood has shown, even better, the fx is so good. Yes I'm gushing shamefully, but let me tell you, you are in the right place if you like thrillers, edge of your seat movies, you feel like pissing stuff. Not going to ruin your fun, no Spoiler.

"I would rate this lower, but it was at least a fun show to watch. Sweet Home is a Netflix series based on the famous Webtoon 'Sweet Home'. Now I haven't finished reading the Webtoon, but from what I have read it is much better than this. From the same creator as 'Bastard', one of my favourite Web series, it's hard to see his work being vandalised with this ""bastardised"" live adaptation.Now it isn't all bad, the show is at least fun and creative. The start of the show was good for the most part, but already from the start the monsters looked a bit silly, and the acting was oddly overdone. Then we start to see a bit of divergence in storytelling compared to its source material; while not always a bad thing, with The Shining being one of my favourite movies - which diverged so much from the book, this is another good example of ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"". The show introduces monsters with barely any explanation of their backstories or the reason they are the way they are. This is annoying as the manhwa clearly illustrates each character and monster and their purpose and reasoning for existing. This gets you invested and explains the weirdness of what's going on. While they do this with some monsters, some of the weirder ones like the charger from ""Left4Dead 2"" who always says ""protein"" or the Usain Bolt zombie having 0 explanation coke across as the dumbest designs in the whole show, despite being the most intensely interesting ones in the book.It doesn't help not explaining things, but it gets worse with how disjointed scenes are. I genuinely felt like I was accidentally skipping episodes with how shitty the overall pacing, where you have one character being chased down being spliced next to him being safe. It leaves me more confused than I need to be. What's worse is that they also fill in the rushed pacing with blank stares and drawn out scenes that in the manhwa existed for a page usually. There are some key moments in the book that were handled so well because of the tension created, but in the Netflix adaptation scenes would be spliced with non-essential scenes that would completely break up the flow and tension.The overall feeling of emptiness, tension, sadness, horror that was created by the book is completely ruined by the over-dramatic acting and the poorly slapped on ""Imagine Dragons Warriors"" song that wouldn't stop playing. With scenes dragged out, dumb looking monsters, disjointed script writing, and what felt like a completely different story being screwed onto the ending, I can't see why you'd want to waste your time with this. It's fun, but in the mindless-bed-ridden-mood kinda way.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Shows are a hour long 10 episode series. Even with a slow start the Sweet Home never lack suspicious, with eye covering encounters with the infected and constant battle of survival and trust it made for a great watch after beating my brain silly with phycological thrillers I just needed to watch something with feeling! The actors put on a brilliant show of emotions draw you in for a fantastic finish primarily over the last three episodes. At times I felt like I was watching an anime. MUST WATCH.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Critics said that the music doesn't match at all or that the storyline didn't have any development. It's like they only watched two episodes and made up their mind. I thought the music added so much to the experience that it was a whole experience on it's own. And the story had so many layers that it actually touched me even after the show was over. I love the background they give on everyone and the twists and turns of the story. The visuals are insanely good and just how certain scenes were shot left me in awe. This was the first time I watched a dubbed show and gave it a try when before I would stay far from it. But this really changed my whole perspective and now I will give dubbed shows a chance. I can probably say this is my favorite show or at least top 3. Not only for it's visuals but for how it left me thinking about the human struggles of the characters, especially the protagonist. Such a brilliant show. Everyone should watch it. I really hope there's a season two and hope they could match how awesome season one was.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Very good tv show
binge watched in one night
very interesting",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
This show is utterly fantastic. The evolution of the characters over the course of 10 episodes is done subtly but in a manner you grasp by the time you're done. This series is so much more than what you would expect and puts other shows of the same genre to shame. You'll run the full gambit of emotions and be left wanting more. 10 out of 10 and truly hoping for a season 2.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I've read the webtoon this was based on, and it was amazing. However, they've changed certain elements of the original story. Some of the characters are different - either different gender, different personality, different back story, different relationships, new characters and missing characters, to name a few.The show also deviates from the original story line despite the crux of it being the same. Now, this is an issue because some of the crucial parts of the original webtoon which makes us, as viewers, understand each character's motives and choices are non-existent in the show. The little backstory that they give us just feels like filler content without actual consequence. My opinion of the show when compared to the original webtoon, is that it is disappointing.However, let's judge this as a show of its own:The visuals look great but also terrible. The art feels like they have a good VFX team behind it, but the direction of the scenes with heavy use of the CGI just feels so low-budget. It kills the pseudo realism that the show could have portrayed.The soundtrack is fine, but the songs that they play during some of the action sequences feel so out of place. It does not fit the vibe of the show or the premise that has been set. The music feels like an attempt at overcompensating for the show's inadequacies elsewhere.The script is all over the place with terrible pacing, and if you have not read the webtoon before, you're left confused and hanging at certain times. It's not coherent. The characters are unexpectedly helpless in a situation where they could actually do something, and are sometimes the opposite. Without spoiling much, you'll find yourself at times pulling at your hair wondering why these characters made such absurd choices. Some choices just make no sense other than, it was the ""edgier"" choice. You don't even root for or think of the primary protagonist as the protagonist of the show.The only good thing this show has going for it is how well the acting is. I can't say much else about this. The show just feels like it had a lot of potential but fell below that quite hard.As a standalone show, I would give it a 6, but as a show based on the original webtoon, it's probably a 3 or a 4 for me.In conclusion, due to the show's terrible pacing and storytelling, it feels like a tribute or a homage to the original webtoon. However, as a fan, I am terribly disappointed in how they've butchered something so amazing.
TL;DR Incoherent plot, terrible pacing, poor direction of the visuals.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Okay, I've been watching k-dramas for years and Seeet Home really impressed me. I've never seen so many blood and monsters in korean shows. I know that CGI not great, but who cares with such nice script.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"It's not scary so don't expect it to be a horror series it's more of a thriller. I absolutely loved watching it and I can't wait for season 2. People who call this boring especially from just the first episode, Are you even watching the same thing as us fans? Lol the first episode was AMAZING and full of tension. Though things do quite down at the middle of the season but they pick up the pace again near the end, so it's totally worth watching. Question is now, where can find something else that's equally awesome?!!! ?쁿",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"Is this a joke????? This series was like a failed animation movie with ""actors"" who forgot their role. The so called human monsters were literally just cartoon animation like Garfield or shrek....!Honestly what the hell was that??? This series is just as bad as the MIST series. The ""actrors"" were so baaaaad !!! Oh my God they were supposed to be scared but the scare feeling wasn't just there. ""Actors"" were intentionally stupid and pretending to shake in fear you could tell. Honestly I've never been so disappointed in a Korean series like this. Its so sad to watch. Sorry but that's my opinion I hate it.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I shared it. The plot is so great. I have to particularly commend Song Kang's acting. His inward feelings are wonderful. I just love it.Can't wait for the season 2.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I enjoyed this adaption of the webtoon but, I wish they would have followed the webtoon a bit more. The deaths of Wook and Yuri did not seem right. Though they could be supposed deaths since at the end it showed Wook in the car, but that could have been the evil infected who turned into a gooey like substance who took over his body. The romance between Jae-heon and Ji soo seemed weird to me too, but I do not know if the show followed the same ages as the webtoon. The meaningless deaths of Hyuk and a couple of others just made me upset after reading the webtoon. I am happy that they could continue the show though but, since the webtoon is over and has a completely different direction the creators will have to come up with brand new ideas. Hyun in this show mentioned in other reviews does seem more like a side character to me. While reading the webtoon I could see his growth and his fight with desire. Still overall people who have read the webtoon should watch the show. Even though it is different, the show gives you a new perspective on the series and hiw things could have happened. Though some changes might make you mad, think of it as an adaption and at least hiw the show ends there can be more to the story because the webtoon may never have another part. I have noticed the author of Sweet Home writes stories that are usually straight to the point and short. If you have not read the webtoon I ask you to read it to understand how the story was originally written. I really wish other stories by this author would be turned into a live action.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"So I hadnt read the webtoon so I had no idea was it was going to be like. I don't like non-english speaking shows either (I hate reading subs but then the mouth being out of timing and movement with the english dub is annoying) but honestly.. the first episode was weird and a lil terrifying at first but because it was a lil weird it made me want to watch the next episode.. few hours later I've completed the show and now I'm reading the webtoon.
I had so many favourite characters (esp Pyeon Sang-wook <3) but it's like TWD where you cant get too interested with a character because anything could happen. Although I hate when that happen, i also loved the storyline because you don't know whether your fav character is about to die or not. The ending was good too but it 100% made a lot of viewers shed a tear.
Hope for a season 2!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I loved everything about this, character development, insane monsters, almost reinventing a genre.. but towards the end it just becomes a slow mo fest with dramatic music. Also all the monsters kind of disappear, and imagine dragons is played throughout.. Needed less music and more dialog.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Season 1 was extremely fun to watch.. its also a self contained story so feel free to watch it... season 2 was the exact opposite. Lost complete interest in the entire series and do not intend to continue when season 3 comes. The story is beyond saving and all these new powers and threads are so uninteresting and bad. I will say Season 1 as a standalone series work for me despite a few cliffhangers which I could honestly live with. Season 2 is filled with a new cast of characters that are way more boring and add nothing of value in my opinion. Also the nature of some of the deaths in Season 2 were so lousy... it's actually ridiculous.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I can believe I am really really liking this show. It is overdone in a good way. Not too much, just right. I really like what they're doing. A real comment on modern Korean society- people being left behind because they don't happen to match up to some spectacular expectations.

"The story is really confusing and a lot of character just doing non sense. I know, horror movies usually are not logical in there action, but this show brings it to a new level. There are too many characters, which most of them are not really interesting to watch. There is a lot of CGI, but the quality is on b-movie level.
It feels like a string of random scenes.
4/10 because they at least are trying to make something watchable.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I must admit I haven't read the webtoon and I don't know how loyal they are staying to it, but I like it. The first season... I remember I couldn't stop laughing at the monsters because they seemed ridiculous. At least at the beginning. But it was entertaining enough for me to finish the whole season and actually enjoy it. I have watched the second season and I was so surprised to see so many things happening in the first episode! I loved it, but if I remember correctly then the first season was a lot slower and brooding. There wasn't as much action packed into one episode. Keeping that in mind I like the second season more. Especially it seems to be exploring even more the subject of where the real monster begins and human as we know it ends. I feel it's a lot more psychological than maybe a lot of people give it credit for. I mean it's not only about the humans turning into weird looking monsters because of some kind of virus and humans fighting them. It's a lot deeper than that. I feel like the actors are playing better in the second season too. In the first season they made it seem like all the characters were kind of in a daze and confused at times, even when they were scared. But if you think about it then that probably was intentional too, because it was all new of them what was happening and they didn't know why. At least that's my take on things. You can agree or disagree, I don't really care. I just want to say that this series is definitely worth a shot.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The ideas and premise shown in Sweet Home aren't new. You have people turn into monsters and basically causing the end of the world as we knew it. I like the idea of how the humans are turning and being affected in different ways by this I guess you may call it possession.Unfortunately the execution makes it all feel completely fake. It's not just the CGI that makes it look fake. It's also how the transformation happens, how people act and even the changes themselves.Just to give a quick example on why this feels fake. Even though it isn't said when exactly it's happening towards the end of the first season we can see it starting to snow. So it plays around late autumn and early winter. This means usually it's rather cold outside. Except for one comment made by a kid no one ever refers to it being cold outside or how winter and snow may affect them. Winter in an apocalyptical event is usually a pretty serious issue. Here it's not even considered.In general food and water seem to be just some minor inconvenience that are also only mentioned once and then never again.The show is focused on human interaction and drama and unfortunately fails there too as the characters aren't feeling real for the most part and I'd call them one-dimensional.Towards the end of season one they also go for a very big clich챕 which is often found in zombie movies and honestly it's just not believable. In addition early on the monsters are established as a considerable threat. However the show shifts the focus away from the threat of the monsters and suddenly they barely make any appearances and are only a nuisance instead of an actual threat. You got to have your human drama...One more thing that really bothered me, was that throughout the whole season we stay in that one big apartment building. I still know nothing about how that building is even structured. We're jumping around between places within the building and often (especially in later episodes) it's not clear where the characters actually are within the building. And btw. with all the destruction going on there apparently was no real issue with getting electricity and that especially is not really believable.Honestly I wanted to like the show and I watched through season one within one week. Throughout it my rating was constantly going up and down between 3/10 and 7/10 because it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately looking at the overall result and also considering the poor choice and placement of the soundtrack at times I can't rate it higher.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

But boredom got to me and I decide to risk one episode nonetheless. Never looked back since.

The ensemble cast, especially Si-young, Song Kang, Do-hyun, Nam-Hee and Gyu-young, are excellent throughout the show.

"I started watching this series again. I starred about 3/4's of the way through episode 1 and wondered what the heck was going on. They were just starting to open the gate. So, I replayed it from the beginning, and then I remembered what was going on. The roof-top ballet, and suicidal teen. I managed to see the first 3 episodes, and got hooked. Maybe it was the chick playing bass. Maybe it was the first real mutant monster with the big long mouth, and blood sucking tentacle. I loved it. I don't watch most spatter movies like I used to, but this one caught my attention. The metal guitar riffs in some of the soundtrack is my kind of music, but the Tubular Bells instrumentals are a bit cliche. The uniqueness of each of the monsters, and their ability to ""take a licking and keep on ticking"" only heightens the dread. How about that monster with half it's head sliced off, sightless, and enhanced hearing grotesque one ear? It still talks! So far so good. It keeps getting more intense. I can't tell what are hallucinations, and what is real, but the bloody noses come and are gone in the next scene, so each person is different. At least it's dubbed, and English subtitles are used for messages, TV screens, and signage. I'm taking a short break before I dive back into episode 4, but plan to keep binging until the end.

Netflix is getting very ignorant in entertainment. There are just some movies or TV shows that are not worth it in anyway shape or form. Rather it come from acting directing the writing the casting department and people who look for screens. When it comes to the art of storytelling and then transferring the storytelling into English for American movie watchers/television series show watchers. Everything should honestly makes sense. Nothing in this show makes sense from start to beginning to the roles that people are playing in the show the stupidest characters with in the show are the females and their responses to everything. If this is the way people conduct themselves in Korea is a situation like this was to occur. Then the show should've just ended with a nuclear bomb being dropped on Korea. I've never seen failure and entertainment on such a grand scale.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The CGI is nothing revolutionary but it is good nonetheless.A quality show with complex characters, an enjoyable story and visually pleasing scenes.I am satisfied with this adaptation of the webtoon, they did not stray too far from the source material and most scenes in the show are scenes in the webtoon.

"Having read sweet home webtoon I was very excited to see it have its own drama. But the show has been utterly disappointing. The amount of liberties taken with the plot isn't even funny. Besides first episode you can be totally certain this is something else. marketed as a hit webtoon but what you get is something else. Webtoon had a good plot progression and pacing, everything was explained nicely and you get to see very good amount of psychological struggle with inner monsters of mc which is totally missing in this series. This show feels more about feminism than anything else. Get a bunch of good looking girls and do plenty of action with them is what this show focused on. Important scenes to plot progression were totally ripped. Especially firefighter girl got more screen time and character development than mc! For god's sake! You're freaking ignoring mc just for sake of your ata girl marketing! I'm sorely disappointed in this show. Please do yourself a favor and read webtoon instead, it is really beautiful story. Oh! Forgot to mention, this series end on completely different note than webtoon so there might actually be a possibility of new season, but with their work in this I'm not watching next one. Webtoon does well to tie all loose ends and end the series on a good note. Also I'm mentioning this again, but firefighter girl totally ruined pacing of storyline. Her introduction to plot is forceful and meaningless to plot itself.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"I wonder if the people who rated this poorly gave up too early. I was one of them, I gave it 5 stars and moved on. But something about it was intriguing, so I came back. Ep 1 was promising, then it went downhill, I dropped it after Ep 3, but when I came back and I didn't regret it. I'm now rating it with a solid 8. The characters were annoying, yes, but they grew on me. Many dialogues and reactions seemed rather stupid, but they leaded to some great scenes. This series has a nice atmosphere, beautiful actors with lots of charisma. I liked the soundtrack and the CGI (yes, I do!). My biggest issue was the storytelling. They told too many stories at the same time. You want to know what happens to a certain character, but you have to wait, because other stories get in the way. I would have preferred it, if they finished one story arc and then moved on. I wasn't bothered by this kind of storytelling that much later on, when the series progressed. Most likely because the characters grew on me, and I was equally invested in everyone of them. To make it short: interesting survival/zombie/monster plot with annoying characters who became less annoying the more you know about them, decent CGI, decent music, some very good coloring and atmosphere. Some very good directing, some very bad directing and yeah ... Could have been better, but they did a good job most of the time. Some scenes were really bad, some were brilliant. Sometimes the action was incredible, sometimes it looked cheap or they just skipped a scene so you didn't even know what happened. It is, what it is. And it was a nice watch and an emotional ride.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"To say it was painfully bad is an understatement. No plot, no script, no meaningful dialogue, I wish I could get back the time I spent watching this.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Although I'm not really into Asian horror, doesn't matter if movies or series, I gave this series a chance and I'm glad I did. The story has kept me interested and the actors are really good (even if sometimes it's a bit over the top). For once, a Netflix series has very good dubbing. The English version is, by far, the best dubbing of a Netflix series that I have seen. Some of the special effects
(monsters) are excellent (the half beheaded creature who constantly says he can't see is, scary and hilarious) . Well worth the watch :)",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Can I swear? If so this series is @u&k<*% brilliant.I've not been hooked this bad in such a long time.

"This is one of those shows that you watch the first episode of and don't feel a connection to it, but with patience it could become your favorite Netflix Original.

You want to see a good kdrama. This is not for you. Cheap soundtrack and graphics with a very bad cinematography makes this series an utter waste.

There's never a boring scene on this TV series. You really can't turn away even for a sec. I love the soundtrack. Looking forward for a next season.,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I bumped upon this series after some reccommendations, and I haven't regretted watching it for a second. The basic idea of people turning monsters is not new but here another layer of reason is added-which I really found fascinating. One can just guess what human desire manifests as a monster. The setting of the place provides an extremely strong atmosphere, I was quite satisfied with the whole representation of the story all along.I am really looking forward to the second season, there are many opportunities to show different human feelings, desires and relations,and I am really curious where the story will go.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The show is very well done. Great monsters, very creative with lots of plots twists, jump scares, blood and mayhem. Good character builds tell individual story lines that keep you guessing who is a monster and who is not. Stick with it and by the third episode you will be hooked.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Having read the webtoon I expected alot from this series but unfortunately it failed to meet ""my"" expectations . The story was great but the direction wasn't . People who haven't read the comic won't understand how great Sweet Home really is.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I think it's well done and looks interesting but after 3 episodes I just don't find myself caring to watch anymore. It's not bad, it just doesn't really seem to be anything I haven't seen before. Perhaps it's got a little more ""column A"" and a little less ""column B"" but it doesn't feel fresh or novel, which isn't in and off itself a bad thing, and I've seen enough of this ilk to not need to see more at this point.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Sickening stupid story
Nauseating dialog

"This show started off strong, even the terrible CGI wasn't enough to drive me way, but after the first 3 episodes sitting through it became a real struggle. After 3 straight episodes of boredom and a huge lack of action, plot, or character development I can't justify wasting anymore time on this one. 3 stars for 3 really solid episodes of horror (again with terrible CGI)",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"This is one of the worst tv series from Netflix.
I was really looking forward to this, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. Characters are boring and stupid. Bad CGI, Bad Soundtrack..etc. I think this drama likes random games.the script is very disjointed.This drama is like The Rain.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"There are multiple scenes where anyone with a brain would realize that something is wrong, but they react so mind numbingly slow. Even when something obviously dangerous is right in front of them, there freeze for an unnaturally long time. I mean, sure, I know that some people freeze in dangerous situations, but they push it way beyond how normal people react. It is super annoying, and destroyed the whole immersion for me. I don't care if it is intentional or bad acting. I simply couldn't enjoy the show after realizing this, and stopped watching.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Waste of precious lifetime. Worthless, meaningless, the lamest tv show project in a decade without any storyline, explanation and human common senses. The garbage",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I know monsters are not real, but thats not what i mean when i said UNREALISTIC, unrealistic is for those characters who suddenly have sympathy for something (monster) for no reason or sympathy for someone who they did spent time with. the acting of some that is unbelievably calm in a situation of horror. its the acting of some rude characters who doesn't really justify in this kind of situation. i didn't give up watching from ep1 to end. but it didn't gave me excitement, i felt more of angry for stupidity of some characters.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"So I started watching this and it was weird, suspenseful and was looking like a good scary series. Lots of creepy things that weren't scary but left you with that feeling you were about to get a fright any minute. To be honest I thought to myself this is going to be amazing. Then all of a sudden, half way through the episode it became an absolute cheesefest. It was like they just swapped out the writers, producers and directors with clueless people. OTT hit stupid levels. Plot swapped to full on zombie scenes and what a joke it was. By the end I was undecided but the last scene was so rediculous I just thought no more. They literally instead of making a consistent group of zombie characters tried to do one of every stereo typical zombie you could imagine, to the point it just looked like they had borrowed costumes, or CGI of every horror film ever made. You're talking axe wielder, chainsaw guy, guy with head split in half, woman upside down in crab position. Every cheesy, stereotypical horror creature possible.Weird how something promising just flipped in to a disaster in seconds.1/10 because it was a waste of time and although I enjoyed about 30 mins, it was pointless because I won't be sitting through any more of the rubbish that followed.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Katana oppar is daddy af. But seriously, The concept is actually pretty strong, mutated monsters with unique skills is interesting, but the story is just bleh and the sfx is passable. It's pretty obvious they want to make this into a long run series so everything just feels dragged so bad, you can skip five episodes and still pretty much gets it. The characters? Omfg the characters are just god awful, the main characters are overly edgy, the supporting characters are overly lame, both have anime logic and sensibility and overall unbearably annoying.If you don't like edgy manhwa you won't like this. Also i LOLed every time a wild 'imagine dragons' appear.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Adam's family movie is more terrifying than this miserable movieWhat is this south korea?셿?셿?셿,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"So bad that you will fall asleep. Is so slow, bad cgi, bad korean show. All the korean show are over acting. And i don't know why imdb now is forcing to write a review longer. It sucks.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
The story is all over the place. I don't see how this show is getting such good reviews. I really wanted to like it but gave up after 5 episodes. Has some pretty cool visual effects but that's about it.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"If you've read the Webtoon, you will be disappointed. I was so excited for this adaptation to come out, but I can't believe they took great IP and did this. The original comic is subdued and spooky in how banal it seems until monsters appear. But this show rushes through character introductions and has a really garish lighting scheme and Party City mask monsters. It looks like an 80s B movie, so if you're into that this might be for you but has none of the original horror. Moreover, it's a tonal nightmare with a random Imagine Dragons' song used as a recurring theme. The flashbacks extrapolate too much of Hyun's character arc in the first episodes which ruins a lot of the mystery about his character. If you choose to watch this and haven't read the Webtoon, I would advise you to check it out to see how good this could've been!",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Watched this series because it seems promising after episode 1. However, after binged 5 episodes I was like ""wtf did I watch?""There are too many scenes that has no impact to the whole story, unnecessary scene or plot like the one with the mobster and the child abuser. But, the most annoying part that got me tired and almost give up is that too many jumping scenes, stupid scenes and weird camera angles or such that sometimes left me confused and did not understand what was going on anymore.I stopped, give a shot to the webtoon version, and im glad I did because it is 100% better than this series. In the series, there is no explanation why they turned into monsters, why Hyun able to resist his desire, why Mr. An and Ji Su who had nosebleed seems to be fine and were not quarantined?, there is almost no monster rather than hulk outside the building making me wonder ""why didnt they just go?"", security guard, runner and spider guy were too weak, literally weird character development, weak bad guys, and literally different ending. Oh, and I hate how they make wook this way (he was a detective in webtoon)Maybe I am asking too much, maybe I was expecting too much for it to be like the webtoon (well, since the scripts on the first 5 episodes were the same as in the webtoon), but why so many flaws? I do not mind if netflix adapted it in its on way, but at least keep using the original webtoon as reference.So many potentials wasted.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Too many plot holes and nonsense character decision. I can' imagine how bad of their dialogues are. This is the worst korean series i,ve ever watched for sure.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Felt like watching someone playing a bad videogame. One of the worst things in Netflix. If this came out from Hollywood , nobody would have bother about reviewing it.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Its plagued by a bad script with undeveloped characters and a ridiculous plot.Camera works and colour palettes are off, so does the music. oh the music are way off.there's a potential but wasted. I hope you not waste your time watching this series.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
CGI is laughable at best and the characters don't develope. Story goes nowhere. Please save your time.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"First off, the translation isn't too clean. There are parts where the conversations just don't make much sense so whoever was in charge of the subtitles made things a little tougher for the viewers. Decent acting but there're times it makes no sense why a character would do what they do, just random events. And the directing is confusing. At least 6 times I found myself asking myself ""wait how did we get here?"""" Did I accidentally skip 10min"". If I didn't read the comic (which is miles better) I wouldn't have understood the story at all.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'll try to explain and leave a review without giving major spoilers (or any spoilers).I'm almost at the end of season 1, episode 9 and I paused watching to leave a review. I couldn't take how ridiculous and unserious the plot is! Don't get me wrong I love apocalyptic shows but this is a mess. The first few episodes showed promise but episodes five until where I paused didn't live up to its hype (it was dragging with an out of place twist).This drama was making a lot of noise since its release but I put it off since there wasn't any free time to watch it. With studio dragon as the company producer and an up and coming cast, I expected the storyline to be epic but was let down. I watched it mainly because of go youn jung (of Law School and Alchemy of Souls) & song kang and continued because the actors somehow made the story somewhat bearable. I hope some of the cast could work together again in future projects!The trailer for s1 hinted its genre as horror/thriller/mystery with the appearance of monsters but honestly the drama was just full of gory scenes and climactic scenes that quickly died down. Lots of characters were fillers and had no significant effect in the outcome. Most of them were either clueless, lacked skills, or an annoying one-dimensional character (one of which was given a sudden and unsuitable arc - yes i'm talking about Kim Seok-Hyeon). Honestly, with a lot of gory death scenes, I was disappointed with quick and unsatisfying deaths of some antagonists - kyeong mo).I'm actually not exaggerating and I cannot stress enough with the number of filler characters this drama has. It actually feels as if they're more of a watcher (like an audience) than a character in the drama. It felt annoying then it became repetitive. Especially the use of (the song) Warriors by Imagine Dragons. It felt out of place in some scenes. CGI was passable.The 'monsters' which are, I assume as, main antagonists of the drama but it felt as if they're just a piece used to kill of characters to give trauma to the main cast or kill off a cast member without reason. I mean in a world where people overcome with desires become monsters, they mainly appear in the dark or outside of the building. Some were located in certain floors and they stayed there for more than half of the drama before appearing again for tension's sake.The drama tried to mirror an apocalyptic world and reflect how people act given the new challenges and moral dilemmas. But ultimately fell short. It didn't give enough depth to explore the different driving forces, agendas, and motivations of each character to let the audience understand and/or relate to them. The only thing this drama managed to do was annoy and anger the hll out of me.If I could rate it higher, it would be 3 (just for the actors' portrayal). Giving the drama 4 or above is kind. I know I'm saying a lot of negative about this drama and a rating of 2 might seem too low of a rating to give without watching the last episode (yet) but it summarizes how I viewed the 9 episodes I've watched so far. I might leave a different review after I watch the last episode.I understand how other people might enjoy this drama even if I didn't. It's just the lack of attention to details and character or world building that irked me. As an avid watcher of kdramas, it surprisingly lacks emotion. Sure I was sad with some deaths and backstories, but it didn't properly capture the wide range of death, anger, resentment, and inner most desires of different human beings.In the end (or near its' end) It's just another apocalyptic drama made to showcase monsters and action scenes.Edit: the last episode was (not surprising) still a major let down. It diluted the supposedly little character development the residents of Green Home Mansion Apartment had throughout the season. I'll hold out watching s2 to wait for s3 finale because as of now, it really doesn't look promising.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"It's a while ago that I watched this show but I always had an odd feeling that it wasn't what it could have been.Yes, the CGI was (compared to other shows) not as good.The acting, it was fine, nothing out of place tbh.But the story? *scratches head
idk what the show is about actually, no clue. There are monsters, yeah, people suddenly turn into monster... and, that's it.How... actually did the firefighter woman got out so easily and was able to get a car, drive to... somewhere without being attacked by monsters but instead being caught by the military? Lot of question marks.I was angry when the prisoners suddenly killed some of the residents... and, how did the prisoners suddenly appeared? It was extremely random.On one hand the resident can't leave the complex, on the other hand the firefighter woman and random prisoners can walk and drive outside without trouble.Nah, really, idk where the story wants to lead us, no clue.Why do people turn suddenly into monsters? Probably I want to know too much but... the answer would make this show a lot more enjoyable.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"First of all i'm one of those people who read the webtoon before seeing this .. For me it's like Death Note all over again .. Cheap CGI, characters act stupid and all rude, pacing is all over the place, acting is subpar and music choice is god awful especially playing Warriors by Imagine Dragon in a fight scene that does not fit .. They've added and strayed far from the source material and make it look like a kid directed this series .. It is watchable but through out 10 episodes i just forced myself to finish it even if its so boring !!",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Netflix What did you do? Stop funding trash. I'd read the summary, thought this should be cool and dived into ep1~7. The acting is average at best,Among them, puppy's acting the best. and Weird confusing storyline. boring conversations. Monsters aren't as threatening as I thought. Overall, it was worst than I expected.
Don't waste your time watching this. This drama is like a teenage.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Terrible CGI
Boring drab lifeless acting
No emotion in the characters
And just terrible bad ugly fake cgi.The quality is just too poor to enjoy on my nice tv.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Some of the actors were great but this fell short of my expectations. Maybe it's because I've watched several shows with a similar premise, but this just didn't capture my attention. And I can tell that this was adapted from a webtoon because most shows adapted from webtoons end up lacking in some way.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"You may want to watch this because you read the manhwa and liked it or thinking that this is original, DON'T DO IT I can't call it an adaptation or original, it's so different and so similar that the best I can do it's call it a rip-off, they cut out so many really important things and replace them with comedy scenes or not replace it at all, same with characters, they replaced some important characters with secondary characters that you don't even care when some of them die, they didn't include any character development, unlike the original manhwa where almost everyone had that moment, the worst thing here is the ending, the ending in the original manhwa was pretty sad and definitely a tear jerker, but here is just a really really cheese cliffhanger, and I have no idea why they did that, cause the story was supposed to end, and from what I saw in this, they can't make something good original to save their life, the next thing is the actors, these are the worst actors I have ever seen, and I can look past bad acting, but this one was just so painfully bad, if you liked this I really really recommend reading the original manhwa, it's completely free on Webtoon so I don't see why you wouldn't.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I'm sorry, but this isn't good. Utterly disappointed given the praise it gets. There's neither a captivating plot (rather repetitive, but could've been overlooked had this been character-driven), nor any kind of psychological analysis of emotions/feelings (at the point where people show unrealistically little fear when in dangerous situations), nor emphasis over the survival aspect of having the world end (like worrying about resources, social organisation etc.). It's just a bit of everything that amounts to nothing interesting-no need for season 2 as there's no need for season 1.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I really don't understand this story so I can't enjoy it. the premise is unattractive and devoid of traction. many things that are not lacking, such as the way the random scene editing makes me uncomfortable watching. and also sudden stories like this and that. oh what a boring show. sorry.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I rly liked the first 2 episodes, but as the series progressed it got worse and worse.The actors behave and have mimics as if just graduated, or this was their first acting.Then there is this bad story telling...
I hated all that stupid charatcter vs character interaction in Walking Dead, this is even more bs.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The premise was there, but it lacks depth (despite dragging everything more than necessary) and it lacks entertainment (with the exception of the first few episodes). The quality difference between the few analog costumes/effects and the (99% of the time) terrible cgi is the same with night and day and it cheapens the series so so much! The characters never develop convincingly enough to actually care about them, thus the feats or even the death of some never has any real impact, no matter how much the director tries to force an emotional reaction (adding some corny editing and some even cornier music)! I could write much more, but the end result doesn't warrant any more of my time. It has some good moments and could have been way more interesting and beautifully stylised, but alas, it wasn't meant to be...",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This show had a good start but quickly loses my interest as they omit the important details we see in the webtoon and the characters are not as similar to as the webtoon ones. I know it's just an adaptation but when you are adapting such a masterpiece by carnby kim and miss such details it's a failure of an adaptation. The details in the webtoon is interlinked to the prequel, shotgun boy, and it really brings out the essence of the story but here we saw blunders in the first episode itself, the most obvious thing was the disturbingly deppresing behaviour of the MC that was not shown properly second adding new characters? Woah buddy sorry but that's a hard pass. Only giving this series a 3 stars because of the fact that it gave such a beautiful webtoon a chance to popularity.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"So the premise is interesting. It has the look of a manga if you like that sort of thing and some moments are really cool. However the story is all over the place, so I agree with everyone who says it starts well but gets boring because of slow pacing and disjointed story telling. It's hard to follow also cause the characters all look the same and the korean names dont help, everyone is like Jun Jin Jon, Kwon bun bam, cin ciun lan, who the hell remembers that. And yes the CGI is that of a low budget straight to dvd movie, but if they paid a bit more attention to crafting a better structured story I would have excused it. In the end disappointing.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"4/10 for the horrible cgi monsters which brings the whole drama down, esp since the show is based on these monsters. Oh ya, the building is also a horrible cgi.it was made in 2020, and this is the cgi? ugh!
Hm what else? let's see, the plot is alright so far. I was scared a lot. It has a quite few heart stopping moments.
However, I'm already seeing some of the korean specific trope, namely, the mother whose daughter is outside and wants to open the gate. I just hated how the other characters didn't let her go the 2nd time. Like hey man, personal choice/decision, the mother has a functional mind; she can consent. She wants to go outside and die? Let her try and die. Stop keeping her and endanger the rest of group. Alright, the first time I understood why they couldn't open the door. Heck, even I wouldn't let her. I'd fight her tooth and nails and override her reckless decision to endanger not only herself, but others too. But bish when she did it again secretly and opened the freakin door, it's time to cut some losses and kick her out of the door. She wants to go that badly to save her daughter? LET. HER. The door was open and they held her back???( I could see that plotline a mile away because THIS is KDRAMA. This is train to busan all over again when the grandma opened the door. ) I can't believe they had literally noone to keep an eye on her after her 1st attempt. Who's stupid enough to let her off completely without 2nd thought? Oh another thing, the bish was not punished for her action. Instead, they had characters be like ""oh, no her daughter's dead."" Ya, well, what about the solider who died unnecessarily trying to save her? (ya, they don't talk about it.) Tbh, they should have the mother try to rescue her daughter to give her some closure. and wth was her daughter doing outside anyway with all those mosnters? how did she make it that far? makes no sense.
oh last thing, i hate seeing that actor in the wheelchair. he's everywhereeeeeeeee. i'm tired so seeing the same face again and again.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
I like this type of series but the monsters looked not good and everything developed very slow we didn't see the main character much as a monster I waited for it and they showed it just in the last episode just for few minutes and some characters were very useless and the ending was very boring still I want the second season I hope the glasses guy will be in the second season I don't like the character but I think he is important for the story. At the start it was very slow I liked the girl with the bass and the guy with the sword in my opinion the best characters of the show his death was very sad.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
Om of thw worst series. Plot is extremely weak and neither the story or characters connect to the viewers. Every episode more or less is having same content. It was so boring that just after two episodes didnt6 get courage to watch further.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"The title pretty much sums it up. I'm a big fan of the original webcomic, so when I heard that it was being made into a live action netflix series I was overjoyed!! I watched the first 3 episodes and even though there were some changes, they weren't enough to bother me. But then the changes just kept getting more and more drastic until it just wasn't the same story anymore. They did Wook so dirty :(I'm sure that if I hadn't read the original webcomic though, or had I known about the changes beforehand, then none of those issues would matter to me, so if you're going in this fresh then I'm sure you'll enjoy this series, but if you're like me then just be warned.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"If you are the type of person who don't care much about plot, then feel free to watch it. But if you do, it'll be a constant struggle and it'll actually get worse with each episode. The pacing was also too fast and many things arent explained. Imagine Dragons is one of my fav band but the music placement is sometimes awkward. Overall I'll prolly still finish watching it cuz my partner still enjoys it. But if it were up to me, I'd prolly stop less than midway.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I've tried very hard to like this series telling myself that the next episode will be better. However, I am just disappointed !.

"... but it has to be done. I watched Season 1 in a binge, it was captivating, fresh and terrifying. The monsters made perfect sense in the story's universe, meeting them was intense, and I felt sorry for quite a few monsters and humans.Enter Season 2.Military-style shoot-them-all-up mess with people and monsters running around and screaming. I got lost in the multitude of uninteresting characters, in random plot lines, in who likes/loves who and who wants to kill who and why. The stupid monster fights were boring because I was totally uninvested emotionally, so I just skipped them. Monsters became some strange zombies and robot-like transformers, howling somewhere in the distance and randomly attacking in large packs? Why?Overall - 10/10 for Season 1, -7/10 for Season 2.What a horrible continuation of an outstanding beginning. Looks so amateurish it's painful.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I watched this series because it has been a trending for a long time in netflix. It has an interesting start, but I lost my interest afterwards. I just finished this drama because I'm bored and nothing to do that time, not because I was hooked up.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I feel bad for the actors. They really did their best. The directing, however, is absolutely horrendous.The pacing is horrible it seems as if they were trying to finish everything in one season, but were running out of time and then towards the end started upping the pace until it's impossible to follow what is going on. There are sudden shifts in pace and scenes seem completely disconnected. Lots of important plot points are completely skipped. It makes a lot of the important parts of the story seem unimportant and skips all of the struggles that helped build characterization.The plot diverges heavily from the original webtoon, as if someone explained the main plot points to them from a moving car and they did their best to reconstruct some context for the show. New characters are introduced which steal roles from existing characters which results in poor characterization and character development for them all. The main character is tossed to the wayside and they barely show his progress. Many new characters are introduced whose only purpose are to drive your blood pressure up and be irritating; Hyun-soo's younger sister is rude and disgusting to everyone, the side characters who live in the apartment do literally nothing but cry, get in the way, cower in a corner when someone strong shows up, and throw a hissy fit when things don't go their way. They contribute literally nothing.Bass girl has her role completely cannibalized and her roles given to the firefighter girl. She ends up being a minor character and spends most of the show being sad about her dead lover, and suddenly having appendicitis and needing surgery which is performed without anesthetics.Later when the prisoners show up, they spend time building up the leader who then immediately gets killed in an unimpressive way. The guy with similar powers to the main character randomly starts killing half the charactersIn the end all of the actual characters of importance are dead, so when they get captured and the firefighter (only iportant character left) turns on them, I felt no remorse.Also, monsters show up and cause issues in maybe 3 or 4 episodes. They aren't nearly as dangerous or scary as in the webtoon, and don't actually do anything. After going into the basement they only find one monster. Once they start fighting, only then do they see that there's actually tons of them, and they start using car beeps from pressing buttons on the keys to distract a monster. But they didn't show them collecting the keys or planning to do this so it seems completely out of place. Not too long after them driving through the basement and crashing, it cuts to another scene upstairs and the next episode they mention the basement is clear and from that point on it's clear, but they never show them killing the monsters. Then, they don't them planning or preparing to make it but they make a armored car pouring tons of resources into it, and drive it out and it immediately gets destroyed by the protein monster. This happens in a cutscene taking like 20 seconds.The series is full of decisions like this that ruin the flow and make it confusing. It doesn't make it fun to watch for someone who hasn't already read the webtoon. And if you have read it, you would be confused why they changed things so much and destroyed any storytelling. That just begs the question. Who is this for?",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Very weak director. Some scenes play are disaster. How this director can record scenes.... that's mean are weak director. Actors are good but some actor(old) to much play ... And visual effects there go total anarchy .. What we want and what we do ..... I can understand the point on this visual effects some time ... But almost idea are good whittle resend evil whittle walking dead. And old Korean actor need to learn that this's Netflix and go out of classical Korean play. This play it's so sugar for other and not good. I still don't watch season 2 but will and write again after and Netflix have problems to do jobs to the end i believe that show have end.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Probably worst Korean series ever watched.
Finished it in 2 days fast forwarded after 1st episode . totally not worth to watch ..all girls look like same ..few male characters look like same hardluto recognise them.plus whole serie in one building make it worst ..save your time don't start else u will watch till end to find some this lol",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"It wasn't bad and it wasn't good. For anyone out there who has ever taken anti-depressants in your life, you know how they don't really make you feel happy or sad? ... how they just kind of create a lack of emotion entirely? That's pretty much exactly how this show makes you feel.. like you don't know whether to keep watching or turn it off or why they even bothered in the first place.There was zero heart and soul put into this. Reminded me of a project where nobody really cared about it and they were more focused on getting it done rather than take the time to connect the story to their audience.This is the show equivalent to eating cold 2-day old leftovers from Olive Garden. Like.. sure it still tastes good I guess.. sort of... I mean I think? Let's just say it's passable but I certainly need to have something better tomorrow to make up for it.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Acting is very bad. A bunch of people staring at others or at nothing, vacantly, for too long. Conversations are stupid. Reactions are even more stupid or non-existent. The first episode is probably the best since it has interesting u-turns, but it fast goes downhill from there. Monsters are very badly made later on, to the point that it's embarassing to watch. I've stopped watching after second episode. Go and watch Alice in Wonderland instead.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"This Show is so dumb but hillarious in the same way, that you just can't stop watching. Don't expect perfect cinematography or screenplay. Neither believable characters, their decicions or motivation nor a plausible plot. Don't bother watching if any of these points are important to you to enjoy a Show.This Show lives from its Monsters and visuals and gore moments. If you're into this stuff, enjoy the ride. The Action is mostly good. The CGI is bad by todays stadards. But all in all its fun.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Tldr; It was more of a suspense and teary eyed jerker. Everyone waiting on Season 2 before really giving it a ""Yay"" or ""Nay."" If anything, at least watch for Lee Si-Young's amazing back abs, which I didn't even know was possible. I had to rewind that part to make sure I wasn't hallucinating-lol.If you looking for something that has great Action? This isn't it, you be better off watching a Shonen Anime or John Wick.You want some Romance? It is almost non-existent even though love is thick in the air, they don't try to progress further than that.Scary? It definitely have its' horror elements, but I can think of scarier things like the 13 ghost or Exorcist. Out of the 3 categories I mentioned so far, it does this the best; while mixing in drama and sadness. If anything, what hooks u from episode to episode, is to uncover the mystery as into why everything is so screwed up.It reminds me a lot of #Alive except, instead of Zombies you have people turning into different types of Monsters; and there is a MUCH bigger cast of characters. With the main protagonist giving you Kaneki vibes from Tokyo Ghoul.Lastly, be prepared to be left on a cliffhanger, if Netflix doesn't give it a Season Two, we are screwed. Overall I think it is average at best, but I still enjoyed watching it and would watch Season Two. To see if it gets better, before dropping it. I think it could have just done better in several other categories, like the ACTION! That was the biggest let down and the 2nd was Romance. I'm like screaming at the screen, ""Just freaking kiss already,"" at multiple moments, even up to the very end.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

"The idea for this series is not bad at all, however the effects are pretty poorly and I think there is an overusage of the warriors which makes it kind of weird at some moments. It can be nice to watch, but it is definetly not great.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Worst thing this show did that it killed the best character ""Jung Jae Heon"" in the first season , like this show literally has no asset but the characters and he succeeded in creating a great charisma so killing the best ones in the first season seams very disparate to me.It just had this logic of ""if we have a couple or a very Lovable character it has to die to make the watcher gets emotional so he thinks the show is strong"".Unfortunately It could have been so much more than this ! Like way better. , as the set is good , actors are very good , and the show began in a really good shape !. Then from the second episode... Oh my , i found myself saying what the hell is going on !!! There are some really silly stuff, and nonesense is happening, also the graphics weren't the best,
Overall..
Disappointing..",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The first 2 Episodes were fun, getting to know the characters was great. Action with the Monsters also great.
after that the show fell flat. Horror got lesser so did the action. Drama was tried, but since not much is happening it got boring pretty quickly.
The characters remain the same throughout the whole show (apart from 1 bad ass which is actually the most intersting character). So if you know them in the first episode, you know them until the last episode.
Pace is the greatest disapointment here. Story was okay, there was enough suspense. but not enough for 10 Episodes. should had been 6 Episodes ideally.
Last episode, was the worst. Nothing was revealed, viewers waited 9 episodes to get at least some answers. but in greed for the next season, they revealed nothing.
In summary: I regret watching all the 10 episodes, hoping that something might happen in the next episode. and I wont make the same mistake, IF, season 2 came.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Rating: 0.1/10The director should learn something from the ""All Of Us Are Dead"" series.""Sweet Home"" has a very bad storyline, the worst CGI, and sound quality.The zombies are more funny than scary.

"""Sweet Home"", the 2020 Korean drama series, presents a dystopian vision that initially echoes the suspenseful confines of being trapped in claustrophobic apartment complex with horrific and supernatural inhabitants ala the Spanish film ""REC"". However, as the series progresses, it diverges into a spectacle that some viewers might find reminiscent of an ""X-Men"" narrative, albeit with a darker, more visceral edge.The series starts promisingly, with a gripping premise that hooks the audience. Yet, as the episodes unfold, the character development stalls, leaving their arcs unfulfilled and the plot feeling somewhat skeletal. This lack of depth in storytelling may leave viewers yearning for more substance behind the characters' motivations and the narrative's direction.On the technical front, ""Sweet Home"" boasts impressive CGI, showcasing a visual feast of fantastical creatures and apocalyptic chaos. Although the monsters are strikingly similar to works of David Lynch for the 1970s. That being said, the reliance on CGI spectacle can be overwhelming, and the constant barrage of digital imagery might lead to a sensory overload, transforming the viewing experience into what could be described as a 'fever dream.'In conclusion, while ""Sweet Home"" offers a visually stunning journey with its high-quality CGI and an intriguing start, it falls short in delivering a coherent and emotionally resonant story. The series could benefit from more robust character development and a more tightly woven plot to match the high standards set by its visual effects. Despite its shortcomings, it remains an interesting addition to the K-drama landscape, particularly for those who appreciate a blend of horror and science fiction.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
IDK how this has.7.3/10 rating what people take while watching these mid shows on Netflix to give it such high ratingsHome Sweet Home is one of my fav comics ever and they ruined it. I was excited about this show but after watching the first episode I immediately turned it off in 2020 and never watched it again then I saw they are making season 2 so I just finished it in 2023 because I don't want to judge anything without finishing and I was right back then for not watching this show because it didn't have the same feeling as the comics they went in the opposite direction and why they use random ass songs on monsters doesn't make any sense not just on monsters the random songs were playing throughout the show every time it played I just rolled my eyes this show didn't need any songs only thing it needs some creepy music and sound design for the monsters that are all did they gave the show to below average editor? They ruined every monster which appears in the show because of these songs all of the terror from the monsters went away and on top of that they used monsters as an obstacle in the story nothing more than that they were never a threat to the people in the building whenever they showed up they defended themselves or defeated them instantly which is totally opposite to the comics in the comics every monster felt threatening and intimidating from the moment the showed up and there was a buildup for every monster which made the entry of every monster terrifying but they removed half of the monster scenes and their entry from the show and focused on the humans which were just stupid the comics is about people who survived in a building full of monsters where anyone can turn any time which is a really great idea but the execution is really terrible here.It should've been a horror show but it is just a mediocre action-thriller at best why does Netflix throw away projects to random teams this could've been one of the best shows on the platform if I felt this terrible as a fan I can't express how bad the writer of the comics must've felt when he watched the show.Netflix has such great animators who created some of the most amazing episodes of Love Death and Robot why they didn't give projects like this to those animators if they don't have a budget to make these shows this show needed an experienced team and a good budget I hope the season 2 is much better than this.,negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The story is addicting enough to make you want to know what happens at the end. There are some attempts at character development to provide some reasoning for the motivations. It is Return of the Living Dead, X-Men and the MistThere are many comments about the horrible CGI and it is true. The CGI was almost at a level of a talented teenager with a laptop and Adobe. Since the series has certain level of dark comedy, I was able to look past that. I was not able to look past that this 10-hour series could have very easily been a very good 2.5 hour movie. There was extremely amount of filler that did not provide any additional context to the move.Other big problem was editing which is the reasoning for my 4 stars. It is disjointed to say the least. It is almost like they taped entire scenes and then cut out the bloopers or mistakes and stitched together what was left with reshooting anything. There are many jumps, skips and entire characters appearing and not appearing and darkness that makes it hard to know what is going on(think Game of Thrones White Walker battle in Season 8). A five second action scene can have 15+ edits and you end up confused. Other big issue....the ending, I have no idea what happened in the last 15 minutes.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"I liked season 1 of the show. It was not perfect, but it was good. Season 2 - not so much.Though technically season 1 was not a thriller, it got very close to the genre on multiple occasions. The small location of the show kind of forced that. It forced neighbors into insane situation, where all hell breaks loose. Everything felt ""personal"". The situation was also nicely playing into characters' fears besides the obvious fear of the unique monsters.The ""team"" getting outside of the building made sense. This was actually driven by the plot and was totally fine, and I was excited to know what will happen to them. But instead of hell breaking even more loose, it was season 2, that broke lose.I do not think the issue is with the change of location, especially since at some point we get ""The Stadium"" which aims to replace an apartment complex from 1st season. I think the issue is with how ""mundane"" the monsters have become, and how there is no fear, no feeling of risk in \[almost\] everything shown in season 2.We no have lots of people, with lots of them having little to no effect on the plot and sometimes even no backstory. There are so many useless characters here, that this was the very first time for me, when I was unable to differentiate among quite a few of them, especially those in the military.Speaking of military: they are the main reason there is no feeling of risk. Even in the lore of the show in general it looks like ""whatever happens - Crow Platoon will handle it"". They are portrayed as the ultimate solution for everything. With almost no flow. ""Almost"", because their leader is often framed as if a villain for no real reason.The show also had a huge time-skip, that left a lot of things to viewers' guessing. And while time-skip itself is not a sin, the fact that familiar characters' actions now make little to no sense - is.You know what else does not make sense? The doctor. He is supposed to be smart, but he have not shown a single speck of intelligence, behaving like a total moron most of the time. I guess we need to think he is smart because he shows attitude to everyone, and talks to monsters (kind of).Speaking of monsters - they are no completely generic. Gone are the unique designs of monsters based on people's fears and emotions. All hail generic zombies. Really, most of the monsters you will see here are just regular zombies, but they look a bit more alive, I guess. They have no personality, which was the selling point of the 1st season.I don't know if original webtoon has the same problem - maybe it does. Or maybe it, at least, does not do this weird time-skip and handles things better and somehow makes everything make more sense. But as a TV show - watch just the 1st season and leave it at the cliffhanger. Do not waste your time on season 2.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Ridiculous and cartoony.What started out as an interesting premise, devolves into a complete morass of characters acting like idiots and buffoons. I know shows love to have survivors that you'll hate, but the ones in this show are so unbelievable and annoying that they detract from the entire plot. More unbelievable is the behavior of the other survivors who tolerate and excuse their poor behavior, even when facing life and death situations. I mean come one! The weedwhacker scene where around 8 or so ARMED survivors just stand there and watch another guy die, simply for dramatic effect?And the gutless morons who turn ""brave"" instantly for no reason.And Korea's obsession with school bullies and how they have to work it into EVERY freaking show they make. Completely and totally unnecessary.The characters in this show had about 10,000 different ways they could have improved the eventual outcome. But, the writers choose the most implausible and ridiculous way forward during every confrontation. Leaving the viewer not caring a damn bit about any of them, as their actions are truly mind-boggling.Could have been so much better. But falls victim to attempts as being artsy. Which fail miserably. Yet, somehow it gets a second season. Scratches head and face palms Netflix.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"Having discovered Sweet Home on WEBTOON, I found this live action adaptation very lacking. Where the WEBTOON version felt chilling, dark, and authentic, this adaptation feels corny, over-stylized, and lacking depth. If you're a fan of the comic, you might very well enjoy this, but I doubt it will be for the same reasons. When I heard that Sweet Home was getting a live action adaptation, I wondered whether or not it would be among the ~1% of live action adaptations that are actually worth watching. I have my answer now.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
"The Kingdom still is the golden standard of Netflix K-Drama if you are interested in Netflix Korean shows. That said, I only watched a few Korean movies, the Kingdom, and this show. Other Korean shows on Netflix didn't quite catch my fancy yet so I stick with what I said about the Kingdom. Korean movies are generally good or excellent.So about this show:
A few good/excellent early episode, but it turns into a mashed potato.
Some CG works are hokey, but creatures and special effects in the show are generally good or great.It follows the Shonen Japanese anime/manage trope. I am guessing the webtoon follows the similar formula.Music choice is really regrettable as well. Warrior, I think, is the song that you will hate after 2~3 episodes. BEWHY song is good and I wish the show just featured the Korean talents.Possible Spoiler:
One last thing. This show also features the annoying teenager and children trope that seem to show up a lot in Asian shows. It's not as bad as the infamous child character(s) from some of those old Kaiju movies.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The script and the way how the director renders it are both disappointing.The director once said this one is going to beat Crush landing on you. That's impossible. I watch CLOY 2 or 3 times.

"""Queen of Tears"" is a mesmerizing Korean drama that captivates from start to finish.

"The fist half of the series had such a flaw it was hard to care about the main characters. When Hyun-Woo learns Hae-In is terminally ill his reaction is borderline heartless. To avoid Hyun-Woo looking heartless the show should have done more to show how horribly mistreated he was by Hae-In. Even if the show did that Hae-In would need to have been downright mentally or physically abusive for Hyun-Woo to be as passive as he is about her illness early in the show.It's just not believable that if deep down he loved her he wouldn't be immediately crushed and sympathetic unpon learning of her diagnosis. Instead he and his lawyer friend almost joke about it and how he can hold on to try and get her to change her will. Later, Hae-In learns this and is ""mad"" but such horribly callous behavior would be unforgivable.The horrible way Hyun-Woo reacts early makes the transformation in later episodes not believable.Also the way Hae-In reacts to the her own diagnosis is also not believable. She cares more about the trillion dollar club than the fact she has six months to live.These flaws undermine the second half of the show and more emotional moments.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I watched episode 15 last night and thought, ""Wow, I haven't seen a Korean drama adopt an Indian soap opera style before."" I had been watching patiently week by week, hoping the writing would improve, but it didn't. It mixed up everything: divorce, a mean mother-in-law, cancer, memory loss, etc.-you name it. I thought the writer was being creative in offering something new because people said the writer was a big deal. However, it turns out the writing is just like a story created by a middle-schooler on Wattpad.I know for sure this drama will be successful in terms of viewership since the writer went back to basics by having good-looking casts and glamorous styles. This recipe guarantees ratings. But, it makes the work look cheap. No wonder Baeksang tossed this drama out of the window by only giving it one nomination (even though the committee might regret this later and wish they had given zero nominations to this series).",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

"Queen of Tears is an emptional rollercoaster and has all the elements of a classic kdrama. Sure, some of the plot is predictable, but it still had me sobbing and binge-watching till the wee hours of the morning.The cast is phenomenal and their performance carried the story through its weaker points, especially some of the side characters who add some much needed humor and have solid development. It's beautiful to see the whole extended family reconcile and change.BUT: Amnesia is the Worst. Plot. Device. Ever.I hate it. No hospital would allow a vulnerable memory-loss patient's care to be commandeered in that manner. It derailed the whole story. Yoon Eun-seong is such a creepy and manipulative villain.The last few epispdes also fell apart because it became more and more desperately dramatic and ridiculous, particularly with serious injuries being disregarded. The main couple needed more exploration of the past conflict in their marriage and then subsequent reconciliation of those conflicts.

It shows titillating love lines and scenes and dialogues that make me tear up and those that make me burst into laughter.The lead actress, Kim Ji Won, is outstanding and right on point in portraying the strong-willed female boss and yet fragile character. As usual, the lead actor, Kim Soo Hyun, also shines in his quirky role.This drama writer always reminds us that there are good sides to everyone and that even villains have a purpose. For example, the main villain has been in love with the heroine since childhood and even protected her from a mad dog attacking her at his orphanage (by poisoning the dog-which foreshadows the sinister way he behaves as an adult). Many of his sidekicks are from the same orphanage, which explains why he joined hands with them.Humanism and doing the right thing are also in the background in this drama. The scenes where the rich in-laws take refuge with the poor in-laws is a little boring but provide a setting where they get closer on the personal level without the boundaries of money.I can't wait for the next episodes.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Edit, after watching 16 episodes:
Still a 6 from me. What might have been a beautiful series, was lost in so many other storylines. Wish it had been more about the marriagestruggles and love, and lighthearted and funny moments, and less about the secret money, shareholders, company struggles, the villain mom/son duo etc.Original:
Was looking forward to this show, but for me, it is a huge let down.Have watched 14 episodes, but I am sooo bored. This evenings Ep 14 got me super annoyed, and I turned it off with a few minutes left. The main plot in this episode is enough, we do not need the bad guy there as well. AND, you know how this episode is going to end, because of what the evidence the Korean police find(trying not to spoil anything here).The ML is very stiff(짬plastic쨩-like), and the FL is either hot/cold, but does a good job.The Bad Guy(in the love triangle) is very unlikable, as he should be.I only wrote this review because of ep 14. Before this, I rated the show 8, but it had gone downhill, and is a 6 for me now. The two last episodes must be something very special for me to change my mind.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I don't get the hype. Really. It was just ok at best. Not many likable characters. The Hong family redeemed themselves after they lost everything and began to cherish family more. I thought that was nice. The villain was laughably obsessed over the main girl. His motives lacked consistency. I wasn't convinced if it was really money or Hae-In's love he actually wanted. I thought the leads did a good job acting overall but hated their marriage relationship. The writers could've done a better job at what led to their fall out. You could clearly tell they were so in love before in the flashbacks but acted like it was their first time with everything which was strange. Alot of their issues could be solved if they tried to communicate and they really had little to no skills. But what is a Kdrama without misunderstandings? Kdramas need to do a better job at portraying hospital settings too. It doesn't make sense that anyone can just waltz in to a hospital and claim they're someone's guardian-especially someone who is of high profile. It had some funny and interesting parts here and there but by the end, it just became outrageous with the stuff they were pulling to keep viewers watching. This show is a total makjang as they call it.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"This is one of the best dramas I've seen in a while. The plot is great and all the actors are terrific. It's well written and pulls at your heartstrings. I am so anxious to see the next episodes and I wish I didn't need to wait to see them. The unconditional love that the main characters have for each other are what we all dream to have. Navigating family and ups and downs of life seems somewhat realistic. I've always liked the lead actor and actress in other shows they've done which is why I was drawn to watch Queen of Tears. They both do not disappoint and, as always, are exceptional. It's absolutely excellent and one of my favorites.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
First time to rate a Kdrama series and its definetely recommended to watch. I'm inlove with all those characters and their super b acting!!! Hopefully they will release season 2 and I'm hoping that it will have happy ending for all of the characters. Every episodes is worth to watch!! Were always waiting to weekends so we can watch this kdrama series. Rooting for Queen of Tears to be #1 this upcoming saturday and sunday... Excellent story and staff and also well done to the director and actors and actresses.. You deserved all the praises and congratulations! Such an amazing korran drama series.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"This is a Korean masterpiece! Great performances by all cast. The leading actress Kim Ji Won (KJW) and actor Kim Soo-hyun (KSH) are marvellous and with great chemistry. I do not speak Korean and I watch it in the original language with subtitles. But, wow, KJW's and KSH's performances makes you feel all the sentiments and emotions that that their characters feel. And although the show can be slow at times, this builds up nicely the anticipation of what happens next. This is why I can't wait until a new episode is released. Lastly, I love the Epilogues at the end of each episode. They add masterfully to the plot of the series and provide context to scenes that happen during the episodes. Overall, is a big YES from me.

"?ⓥ쑉?ⓥ쑉??Writer Park Ji Eun once again made another interesting story for us. If you're tired of watching kdramas that bores you even before it get's to the 2nd half, trust me Queen of Tears is different. Every week is a new roller coaster of emotions & twists. But it does not go out of hand it will always bring you back to it's maim message. After 3 years, Kim Soohyun is back and sure he never disappoints with his drama choices, Baek Hyunwoo is just perfect for him, we all know he made his name because of his exemplar acting skills but everytime he's on another role he still surprises me with his acting and delivery, combined with the likes of actress Kim Jiwon who also never fails to capture our hearts with her roles. Queen of Tears will be her era, it's Kim Jiwon's time just like My Love From The Star was Kim Soohyun's era. The dynamics of every character in this drama is important no role is a waste, it's one of the power sof Park Jieuns's writing skills.It's high quality production, from props to locations, script to direction, to screenplay. 1.5hrs of every episode will not feel long because your eyes will be delighted with the qualoty of this production.As someone who has been watching kdramas for almost 20yrs, trust me on this. This drama is interesting, worth the time, and the emotions you'll end up spending every episode.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"It will remain in my top favourite drama..yes people think it has lackings it has but the emotions it delivered,chemistry of leads,love story & It's depth,human behaviour on changing love with situation portrayed so beautifully..Kim Soo Hyun & Kim Ji Won were absolutely perfect together..the story of family members also make u emotional time to time..most important their lost love and finding it again will make u think ego isn't that important..standing beside ur loved one's in every situation is even though u have bitter feelings for then..after a long time a drama that made me so emotional..",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
This drama is the best that happened in 2024. I've never invested in a korean drama for too long until Queen of Tears came. The pairing of Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won is lit. They nailed the character of Baek Hyun Woo and Hong Hae In. Their acting is superb along side with the other cast and the cinematography is just wow. I cried a lot more than I did in other korean drama. I realized communication is very important in every aspect of relationships especially when you are married. Don't let pride take control of your emotions. I really hope Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won will get an award for their performances here. Fighting my yuyu couple!,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Your typical rom-com filled with many cliches. However, the show is quite addicting and it quickly builds empathy and sympathy. For rom-com fans, I'm sure the show offers everything they want in a show like this. For others, this is more of a guilty pleasure. Satirical depiction of husband/wife roles in traditional Korean society is quite funny and on point. The obliviousness of the super-rich is also hilarious. Again, a strong cast with exceptional acting carries the show forward. However, there is no denying the fact that the show is way, way too long. Each episode is nearly 90 min (x 16 episodes). Because of the sheer length of each episode, you will inevitably have to sit through a lot of filler scenes in each episode. If the show was cut to 75 min per ep for 16 ep or 90 min per ep for 12 or 14 eps, this could have been a much, much better show.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"If I could only give a higher rating than a five star, then I would. I absolutely loved this k-drama right from the get-go. Words are not enough to describe how beautiful this series is. Everyone did a fantastic job in it. The casting was perfect. One of my favourites aside from the lead couple is Aunt Beomja. She is so transparent and a good judge of character. Hats off to Kim Soo Hyun for a brilliant performance in this drama. I could clearly see why he is the highest paid actor in Korea. He is beyond expectation. He is versatile. He could make you laugh, cry and fall in love with him in an instant. Kim Ji Won suited her role as well and she was perfect for it. As I was watching the first few episodes it gave me the vibe of CLOY including the OST. They were a perfect match in this series. I thought to myself, finally there is another k-drama that could beat CLOY. Among a few friends I know including myself have taken a hiatus from watching k-drama as there isn't really good ones out there anymore until Queen of Tears. I watched this drama not realising it was not complete yet i.e. Missing episodes 15 and 16. Since it was so good, I watched it again from the start while waiting for the last episodes to become available which made me appreciate the series even more as I understood it better compared to the first time where I could not contain my excitement and rushed into watching it. Now, I have completed the series and I am over the moon. It was so beautiful. A story of love, family, reconciliation, friendship, character, sacrifice, perseverance, patience, selflessness, humility and so much more. Your one stop shop to a feel good k-drama.

"I watched the whole series, but it didn't bring anything new or exciting. At first, it seemed promising, especially in how it explored the main character's story. When Vincenzo made a cameo, things got interesting. But then, it went downhill. The show became all about drama, ignoring other important storylines. Some scenes dragged on too long, with lots of unnecessary emotions and twists that didn't matter.The show looked good with its camera work, acting, and music, but it had some big problems. The bad guy was shallow, just after money and power. And the main girl's family was portrayed as kind of dumb, which didn't make sense. The story was too predictable, following a basic pattern with choices that didn't seem real.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The storyline is pretty basic and sometimes even foolish. The actors are good but subplots are too much and boring to say the least. Too many villian and many cliche scenes. Wasted my 6 hours to find out what the hype is all about this drama turning into a big waste of time. I think go back couple handled this genre pretty well considering how they're handling this. Both leads are pretty generic characters too. And them showing ML too much of a hero was putting me off. Sorry for others it's just my personal opinion. They had a used but good plot, I just wish they handled the characters better and somewhat relatable but they're not.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"As someone who has been on dramaland for more than a decade, I can assure y'all that Queen of Tears was THAT drama. No wonder the kdrama was a hit, they gave us EVERYTHING. The plot, the chemistry, the acting, ost, everything was top tier. They truly deserved all the praises and audience.We are so used to watching kdramas that end with ""They lived happily ever after"" that watching QoT and seeing what happens after ""happily ever after"" was amazing and super different. I'm not knetz but I feel like, after so many years, QoT was the drama who made korean people gather together to freak about a kdrama again. And this already tells a lot about the drama.Kim SooHyun and Kim Jiwon (also all the crew) gave us an unforgettable love story with BaekHong couple. I'll thank them forever for accepting their roles on this. Queen of Tears has become one of my favorites kdramas, so yeah, I recommend it. Forget the haters, they're being only bitter and jealous over this masterclass of acting and developing a good love story.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The series was through and through really good.However the love of the ML for the FL is what got me loving it the most.The end was amazing ! - even if it went on to show us further about the couples future I would have loved it !EP 12 - 13 - 14 may have felt slightly dragged but then it was required for the story as well.Kim Soo-hyun acting is outstanding !He makes us cry and laugh and fall in love !I enjoyed the whole series - specially the last episode which was really complete.The FL is really pretty and acted really well as well.However in the beginning I felt that there were wayyyy too many villians. Every one was out to get them. But i suppose that is true for such rich people, every other person is ready to stab you in the back.The parents of ML were amazing. Even the father of FL is really good.I loved the story of FL brother.His love for his wife was so unreal. Who loves like that?. But it was so good to see.But mainly it was the role of Baek Hyun-woo that totally kept me hooked on. What a love.Unbelievable.Each episode had atleast one scene which you want to go back and watch again.All those scenes in Baek Hyun-woo village.... and in the girls family shooting ground as well !The Germany scenes....
Too many good scenes to recount.Too many scenes that make you want to cry.Baek Hyun-woo was a master piece.Not to forget the little scene of Song Joong-ki, I love watching him :-D he is so good too !",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Every actor in this drama did not bring their A game but their major league game. Of course there will always be tropes or the usual associated with k dramas but in reality it depends on.how it's executed and here it's executed flawlessly. I have never cried so much watching anything ever. These actors especially the two leads ( The two Kim's ) Kim Ji-won and Kim Soo-hyun were amazing if you pay attention to the micro emotions. I would say only one episode didn't feel in flow with the series that being ep. 14 for me. Overall it was visually amazing, the story was utterly complete and unlike most k dramas it had an entire conclusion in the end. As for the many things that happen to this couple in the drama well rich people get victimized too. Everyone is human. The best k drama I've ever seen. I will miss seeing them and will definitely rewatch this many times. I cannot say enough about it. It's what k drama should be period.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Loved Queen of tears Kdrama. Romance is sooo classy and touchy. I love the story writer first for such master piece love story with superb emotions. Bot actors have done excellent job in taking best story to the best levels with good acting skills. Kim Ji Won... wooww.. she is just marvelously beautiful, gorgeous and sooo loving... After watching Crash Landing on you, Scarlet Heart Ryeo - Moon Lover, This is another master creation from technical talents in Korea. I love the technical department for working on this beautiful drama romance between married couple.And the OST for Queen of tears is simply superb.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
Amazing leads and such an emotional story. Lots of tears were shed throughout watching this emotional show. Kim Soohyun and Kim Jiwon kept me watching all the way and the supporting cast were also all fantastic. I would say though there are some plot holes were it could have been solved easily (can't really say without giving any spoilers). But this did not stop me enjoying the show at all or take much away. Haven't watched a kDrama like this in a long while and totally deserves to be tvns top rated drama!! Worth the watch.I would rewatch this all over again but think my heart needs a break from the all the emotions.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I really enjoyed the series. The main leads had great chemistry and the rest of the cast was excellent too. As always, this is a K-Drama and it seems all the directors goes to the same school for directing and storytelling. They love to reuse the grabbing of the wrist/arm to get the girl's attention. They use 5-10 camera angles saving someone from falling. They have the ""deer in the headlights"" reaction when being kiss or hug. They have drivers that never slow down when someone is standing in the middle of the crosswalk. And the directors love to have someone stop in the middle of the crosswalk to chat. I do want to point out some ""bulging eyes, hands to the head"" WTF moments. I know some of these examples is probably to add suspense and push the narrative forward, but...!? When the main villain has the rifle pointed to Baek and Hong, after the police told him to drop the weapon and he started to raise the rifle, they should have shot him! And even when he shoots them, the police doesn't do anything and actually gave him time to reload his rifle before opening fire?? The worst moment is the chairman not questioning the clause in the contract! If the Hongs has a scandal, all shares and interest goes to the villain?? Only Baek said that the clause should've been taken out. I guess the writer of the show wanted us to believe that the Hongs are idiots and morons. Like I said, the directors must all use the same manual when creating these moments and scenes. Ahhhh, but that's why we love watching K-drama/romcom because of these cheesy and head scratching sequences! Overall, Queen of Tears was a fun and very romantic series. I highly recommend it!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Visually stunning spectacle with a promising premise that unfortunately falls flat due to a mediocre and sloppy storyline. While the lead actors' undeniable chemistry manages to salvage some moments, it's not enough to overshadow the glaring shortcomings of the plot.The story feels rushed and disjointed, with gaping plot holes that leave viewers scratching their heads. It's evident that the creators poured a hefty budget into the production, evident in the lavish sets and breathtaking cinematography.What saves Queen of Tears from being a complete disappointment is the lead actors' palpable chemistry. Despite the weak material they're given to work with, they manage to inject life into their characters and deliver believable performances. Particularly, Kim Ji Won shines with her acting prowess, showcasing potential that could lead to promising opportunities in the future.IT may offer some entertainment value as a one-time watch, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impact. The high production value and memorable lead pair might be enough to draw viewers in initially, but the lack of substance ensures that it won't stand the test of time.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Aap bhi ise jaroor dekhe.It is very good, I am rating it after watching it completely.The story of how these two fall in love This feels quite good to me, really I liked the masterpiece, if you want to watch it then take a subscription to Netflix. If you are an Indian then I would tell you brother that you like all Bollywood movies And start watching Korean movie. In this you get to know the meaning of patience, if any movie of us is made then the foolishness starts in it, which is wrong That's why watch this kind of movie where there is love, care and worry, however much I add it is less. I liked it very much, rate it once after looking at the rest of the blog.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The plot itself is a standard. Rich family and a bunch of people who would like to take their wealth. When they do, the family is trying to win their things back and that's it. I find it absurd that the whole family is portrayed so naive, even the lead actresses who is a stern/""cold"" business woman. And I find it even more unbelievable that the 3/4 of the cast are against them and they can do absolutely everything. Bribe, lie, do break ins, incitements... Anyhow, twists and spins are predictable, so is the love story between main characters with their ups and downs. There are moments which will make you laugh and moments that will make you cringe. Overall, I give it a 6*. Nothing breathtaking, but still worth your time if you like that genre.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I love the work of Park Ji-eun as well as the leads and cast chosen. Even the storyline was interesting. But, in the end, there were too many situations and plot aspects that were inconsistent with common sense and reality that it distracted from my viewing pleasure. I do understand you have to suspend logic and soften the viewing lens sometimes- I am OK with that. I won't give away any spoilers but I count at least 20 times where I found myself saying out loud, 'that doesn't make sense', 'his character wouldn't do that...', 'why didn't they do this/that?'. Crash Landing handled these situations well enough to help us move forward. This program didn't and it's a pity. This series could have been a classic.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"At first the drama didn't really hit me and honestly I kinda got bored within the first few episodes. However, after really being intentional, I couldn't stop watching it. I cried A LOT and laughed and smiled and let's be honest ain't that what we all anticipate in dramas? A rollercoaster of emotions. Every episode had me on the edge. I'm rooting for Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won as a couple outside the drama. Their chemistry on-screen was beyond the roof. If I'm being honest I wouldn't want a part two because it's perfect. Everyone had a happy ending. A sequel or a prequel would be better. I'd definitely recommend this 100%. Thanks for making this drama.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

The bond between soo cheol and da Hye is also very nice cause they care for each other. I really liked our leading couple.When my friend told me that she couldn't stop her tears while watching few scenes, i couldn't believe her. I was like, who will cry watching drama.

'Queen of Tears'It's a romantic family drama.The couple who are not on good terms, get their marriage on track, they and their families reconcile like never before.

The series filled with visually appealing aesthetic, designer outfits and stylish sets. However, the narrative falters in the later episodes.The drama suppose to be a tearjerker but I hardly get emotional. Though I enjoyed storyline of other supporting characters.

"I feel the writers sometimes write dumbed down screenplay purposefully.. perhaps catering to a large diverse group of people means watering down.From the get go, I found the episodes dragging, some of the scenarios and dialogues were so cliched.

I understand the truly rich live with a different set of rules nd , yes, there is a strain of insanity?삂 likely... but seriously, I found this series awfully tiresome. Watching the first four episodes was tough.I know my review is contrarian to the majority of reviewers here. Having said that, I watch absolute slapstick and sometimes poorly made shows.

The director controlled everything so perfectly that I want to see the person who produce this,and my feelings. This story is THE BEST KOREAN DRAMA in 2024,So I will tell you a synopsis of the story. The story is very sad. Even though the hero and heroine love each other, each side has reasons and there are problems. The heroine has a congenital disease that will kill the hero himself.

Up until now, the series isn't finished yet, but I hope it happy ending.Dont forget to watch too!!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"It had ups and downs but now i felt so lost after it ended.. Really fantastic series with fantastics casts, especially the leads. It shows human nature, marriage life where communication matters.. Reverse roles in the leads made it a new way to watch kdrama.. Their love looks and feels so deep, even viewers can see it through the screen. Even though kinda dragging on the villeins and other characters, it still ended beautifully. One of my lifetime drama, been waiting for 2 years for this but now it's over i feel so empty. Gonna be really hard to forget Baekhong. I jope the special episode will do justice ?쩄",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
It gives me a roller coaster ride of emotions. The chemistry of Soo Hyun and Ji Won is superb! The story line will really draw you to feel every episodes. And the starstudded casts really shine in their acting skills they're so good that they are too convincing. There's no episode that I didn't shed a tear. It is so nice that I cannot let it go yet. Huhuhuhu I'll miss my weekend comfort the comfort and rest in my tiring weeks. Thank you for the 8 weeks. Ji won is also very prettyyyyy. BaekHong's visuals are top notch they look so good together. Also the way they enjoy the filming of the show really resonates with the fans. And lastly It open my eyes to value time cause we cannot bring back what is already passed. That we do not know what tomorrow has for us so see and be grateful for each day of our lives.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The plot I have mixed feelings but the acting is excellent you can see that the actors actually put their all in the role give to them like anger, happy, love and so many emotions. I will really want to acknowledge the female lead who was able to portray such good acting like behaving she does not care but she cares, being a boss lady and so many others. The series was quite interesting but there was not too much shock value, not a lot of surprise and the plot looks quite boring if not for the actors i wouldn't have been able to watch such series. No adventures at all ooo

"Perfect story that had no mistakes,the storyline had no confusing plot twists and was easy to watch. It had the perfect mixture of comedy,melodrama,romance and you get addicted. I get emotionally attached to most of the kdramas I watch and this kdramas gave me the best ending and made me feel complete after watching it it was so perfectly ended making everyone happy. I've watched 5 kdramas just in 2024 I am very positive this is the best one I hope they get many awards for this masterpiece! The director knew what he/she was doing and the acting was top notch, perfect casting. The show didn't have any unecessary scenes just to make it longer so every scene is enjoyable and because it is a mixture of many genres I think MANY WOULD LOVE IT!

"Queen of Tears is a K-drama of two halves. The first, composed of its early episodes, is an innovative take on K-drama romance. The other is a chaotic second half that squanders much of the potential of its beginning. The Netflix hit ended Sunday with a global audience that exceeded the wildly popular Crash Landing on You.In terms of chemistry, the leads were a perfect pair. It's like they were crafted from the cosmic dust of perfect on-screen couples. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for other characters and sub-plots on the show, which are more disconcerting than fascinating.Plotwise, the series started losing its charm in the second half as well. The amount of scenes that felt repetitive and the back and forth between the main leads only showed the lack of creativity of the writer. While the show we ended up with remains compelling, even fun, to the end, the decision to dispense with its profoundly tragic and emotional core makes the endeavor more rote and, at times, even boring. The series never recaptures the rare thrill of its early episodes, but nevertheless had a sweet ending that will surely be a satisfactory element.My Rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I wished to see something different, but 2 episodes in and I felt like the writers have played it safe by using the old popular over-the-top grandiose story of ultrarich and their stereotypical characterization - some cold-hearted and stiff, some unbearably childish.I like Kim Soo Hyun and his dramas have been really outstanding. But here, although he still delivers some powerful acting, I felt like somehow he's acting too cute and not so natural anymore like before. The female lead's character is cold and seems a bit tired, that all I can see is a well-rehearsed acting, lacking depth much like the storyline. I am sure she's been great in previous works.This drama may be satisfactory enough for Kdrama fans who love glorified stories of ultrarich, beautiful visuals of Korean actors/actresses and popular cheesy romance, but not outstanding enough in terms of acting and storyline to impart anything profound to the viewers. Well, this is just entertainment and that's it; and maybe, this is just how people like it -- just a safe entertaining respite from reality, even if it's superficial. However, talents and resources could have been better used.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
One day when only one of us is left.. Was a sure sign that this will end like this. It's a happy ending with a life lived to the fullest with the one you love. I remember one such ending in movie.. where the crawdad sings.It's a great series one of the best ever in kdramas for me. Right from when it hadn't even started. I knew this will end up as one of my favorites along with it's ok to not be OK and crash landing on you.It will win lots of awards..The actor sure knows how to cry. It has become his trademark style but the actress too cried in one of episodes and gave her best performance...,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Talking about the character of the villain Yoon Eun-Seong. It was a very well developed historical construction. A villain who in essence is not created to feel hate but rather pity. Eun-Seong, from the beginning to the end of the drama, dedicated himself to doing the best he could, the best he knew and learned to do. A character who grew up with a strong trauma of abandonment and rejection, always on the margins and forgotten, living in the shadows, praying to be remembered by his mother figure. He spent his life developing a strong identity crisis based on a perfect image to be recognized by his obsession, our beloved protagonist Hong Hae-In and also by his mother. As a bonus, he has to confront his greatest enemy, not the protagonist Baek Hyun-Woo, but himself. And every time Eun-Seong had to face that Hyun-Woo was ahead, he felt even more inferior and lost. In the end, our villain's story itself is a true drama. Result of an accumulation of childhood traumas and distortion of self-image. Yoon Eun-Seong, you should never have felt so inferior, you never lacked anything that was left in your classmate, you just lacked therapy (k).The script of lead couple Hong Hae-in and Baek Hyun-Woo was constructed to be relatable. If for a moment, we put aside the entire ramification of the story and focus only on the couple, we spend the entire drama identifying with one context or another of the moment they lived or are living.Real marriage is not a fairy tale and Queen of Tears made a point of reminding us of that. Daily life can be exhausting, the lack of dialogue starts to bother you, pain is felt differently by people, as is grief. The intensity too; everything for two, will always have two perspectives and we can easily forget that and added to a routine life that we are forced to live, love ends! Hae-in and Hyun-Woo showed us this in an extremely faithful and painful way, how the process can be slow, but extremely easy to stop loving someone and not even realize it. And it is in these moments of extreme exhaustion that something always happens, whether in a drama or in real life.Queen of Tears begins and ends with wedding vows for a reason. It's a drama that begins and ends with love, but shows us in the clearest ways possible, that love alone will never be enough; You always have to fight for what you want. And for that we have the entire plot of the series based on this constant struggle for love to prevail. Fight against your own ego, against your own desires, face your fears, admit your mistakes and face the consequences, accept your flaws, learn to give in, explode with anger, cry bitterly, laugh heartily, scream in despair, cry drunk in the corners, vent with friends, being humble and so many other attitudes that not only Hae-in and Hyun-Woo showed us, but also all the other characters in the series showed us.Finally, I would say that Queen of Tears' ""Mexican soap opera"" is wonderful, but the care for reality and the intensity that Queen of Tears delivered was simply perfect. Honorable mention also goes to the protagonists, Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji-Won. It was only an incredible K-Drama because the cast was incredible.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
The fact that this has only 8 stars is mind boggling. Probably the best Kdrama ever made and the only thing close is lovley runner. This has everything you could ask for in a Kdrama the 2 main leads are absolutely incredible and the acting alone is 20/10. The story and drama was amazing. And the co-leads absolutely incredible. There isn't one dull morning episode in this show and you could rewatch it honestly and it just gets better and better. The plot twist in each episode is incredible and the writers did such a incredible job on keeping us on our feet each episode. The last episode alone can make you cry 10 times. If you havnt seen QOT please grab a bag of pop corn and be ready to be emotionally destroyed lol.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Literally, I don't know that why some people are saying that the story and the plot is so cringe and it has no story line, but for me it is the best kdrama I've ever watched, like this kdrama made me write a review because I personally don't write reviews but today I had to.So as per the story line, it's too good like I don't have enough words, the storyline gives us a good moral and also it's like that just a few moments ago you have cried and then you are laughing, it's like this. The story takes a big turn! After episode 10, there not might be a kdrama this good. I know it's kinda emotional but some scenes Literally give chills and a good laugh and it's a kdrama or we can say drama in which the main female lead doesn't give attention to the villain, like on indian or any dramas there is that the female lead or the male lead gives attention and gets brain washed because of the villain but in this case nothing happens like this and which is a good thing. The Era from episode 11 to 16 half is the emotional one and the most annoying but also the best. The funniest thing, I have seen the kind cry more than the female lead who was actually dying. But that's okay, that's how love is, now the ending is good too, it contains many emotional or good morals. For me it's the best kdrama in my eyes and opinion, words aren't needed to describe it and how many times I say that it's a very good kdrama, even the best word used describe it is not there in english, no matter how many times I say wheather 100, 100000 or millions or maybe trillions, it won't go up to the level, it is such a beautiful kdrama, it is full of elegance and it is realistic, awfully good..",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

"I haven't seen anything this good in a while! As someone that's watched kdramas for such a long time, I know how difficult it can be to find a genuinely good drama. This is one of those gems. I can't even decided which was better, the writing or the acting? Probably both. The plot was nothing extraordinary, but the execution was top notch. No amount of reviews can do this drama justice, you should simply watch it for yourself. You will not be disappointed. I see this easily being the best kdrama of the year, and it's not even mid year! Definitely one of the best kdramas I've watched, 10/10!...",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"From the very first episode of ""Queen of Tears,"" it was evident that this drama boasted a substantial budget, thanks to its cast of A-list actors, including the highly paid Kim Soo Hyun. The early episodes immediately captivated me, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next episode. However, as the series progressed, the storyline became somewhat predictable, which is understandable given its familiar themes. Initially, it presented itself as a pure romantic comedy, but then it introduced a thriller twist-a common element in K-dramas, though I wish they had stuck to purely romantic comedy without venturing into darker themes like murder.The final episodes felt rushed, as there were numerous unresolved plot points from earlier episodes that deserved more attention. Despite these criticisms(?), ""Queen of Tears"" was undoubtedly a successful drama, largely carried by its stellar cast. Without these talented actors, I doubt the show would have achieved such popularity. They truly carried the series to its acclaim.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
Watching this drama made me cry like anything. ITS PACKED WITH ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS! I've been watching kdramas for 3 years now and this one easily made its way to #TOP3. I feel like the cast absolutely delivered everything so well and screen writing was top notch! I loved how each character was given importance and their leisure screen time and story had many turns. I overall loved it so much. PLEASE DONT SKIP THIS ONE OMG. I just loved waiting for a new episode to drop every weekend and the couples chemistry was daebak. Baek Hyun Woo and Kim Ji Won made this story a 10 times better. They deserve couple of the year award.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"This series was a bit much.Not only is it 16 episodes, but each one goes for at least 1 hour and a half!! And the script is at least 2 dramas worth of storytelling!!...
That is not to say I did not enjoy it. Luckily, what it does well, it does REALLY well. But you also wonder if it is because of the excessive length, or how it tries to do TOO much, or even how it relentlessly hammers certain feelings and cliches into submission. And at some point, there's too much fluff that gets in the way of what could have been a very effective and efficient core! From deadly diseases, to gigantic corporate power-struggle, even different-class romance, etc.It mostly works because of the leads and some GREAT supporting roles.The male lead is a professional punching bag, but what might be worse, is how perfectly capable he is at dealing with it all. And the female lead is to die for! Then there's the scene composition, editing, production, etc. It's a beautiful show.. so you can tell they used their budget properly (or was rather expensive).I would recommend it IF you can spare the time investment, are fine with overly complicated-and-unrealistic plots that sometimes are resolved quicker than you can see them coming, and accept the fact that they abuse the ""drama playbook"" in its entirety. This has it all, and that might be a fault more than a strength. Thankfully, the ending is so overindulgent that you can let go with a feeling of completion.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"All actors are excellent. That's why my wife and I were looking forward to watch this k-drama. However, during the 4th episode we stopped viewing it for various reasons.The basic assumption of this drama, she is going to die within 3 months, is already a matter of taste, but the reaction of the the male lead is absolutely strange. He is full of joy that this way a divorce becomes superfluous. This is the ultimate violation of what marriages are all about. How can someone possibly recover from here?The discussions with his layer friend are weird. They kind of follow the same line of evil reasoning and they happen in public places. For me it is just a question when somebody who is not supposed to hear this will learn about his thoughts this way.Then there is a scene where the makers try to produce tension using a message sent to her cell phone from his relatives about divorce. He has to prevent her from reading it. We felt that we saw this kind of problem already quite often in other dramas or movies. It is just annoying. We used fast-forward to avoid seeing this mess.Btw. His relatives appear stupid when sending this delicate message to her. Their behavior is not understandable. This seems to be a general problem of this drama, that the behavior of the persons involved appears to be unreasonable. This is why we did not feel any emotional relationship with the characters.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"This drama is so unique for me.. it's a combination of all type of emotions. It's worth to watch such kind of drama.People are saying there are lack of chemistry between them but dude they are divorced couple ..they should behave like that.. absolutely realistic drama ..the plot isn't very uncommon and it's actually happen in every family with every couple..Each couple have their own way to show their love...I really really love how beautifully presented the drama is! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DRAMA
I REALLY NEED A HAPPY ENDING. Thank you for giving us such a beautiful drama in 2024 . Till now it's best drama for me. Looking forward to it . It's hard to wait for the next episode. Now only I HAPPY ENDING OF THIS DRAMA CAN FIX ME.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The plot seems interesting in the beginning, but it kinda lost themselves during 4 to 5 episodes. It gets worse as it reaches 7 episodes. All the plots related to vengeance or coup of the group infiltrate in the family seems unreasonable and unrealistic sometimes. The way that the guy finds the video store is totally out of the blue. One card and he assumes that he has a video that would destroy him.Once the 7 episode shows the divorce issue, everyone forgets everything else and focus only on that.The show had everything to have different twisters and turns, but ended up a story of a vengeance plot that will work out at the 2 last episodes like every kdrama.Kdrama needs to understand that Mexican novelas had their hype as well and it seems that kdrama is getting the same way and soon to be in a level that people are fed up with the same plot.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Queen of Tears wasn't the typical cutesy romantic K-Drama, it was more of a serious, dealing with illness and a little too violent however good enough to keep you drawn in to want to keep coming back for the next episode. The lead couple are both cute - the lead male more-so than the lead female since she came off a little too aloof at times. Deducted the 2 stars for the ending - wasn't my favorite. The best thing I noticed in this drama was the lead male's acting and his ability to show so much emotion - tears in his eyes - you could just see the love in his expressions. Worth watching overall.#QueenOfTears.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

At first I thought it's was like typical romcom drama,so I thought I knew what's gonna happen but as I watched more episodes there are many plot twists. Never invested myself so much in a drama, I felt like I've became a part of their family. I cried a lot through the whole k-drama. Never cried this much. Though they tell you it's a romcom drama but you may find it traumatic( like me). Though people say it has happy ending, almost all of us cried until the very last seconds. Cuz it's so realistic. After it QUEEN OF TEARSAnd Kim Soohyun is a great actor. The way he changes his emotions throughout the drama and his facial expressions will make you realise why he's the highest paid actor of korea.Their chemistry was so good that you'll really think they're married irl.

"This is a show all about memories. It shows us that memories defines us. As life goes forward the hardships increase and we just forget the begining, and life is always like that we are always focused on the ending that we forget how beautifully the begining was. And only when life hits you to the bottom you think about the mistakes you did and regret about it and despite all the mostakes we can change ourselfs. And they conveys to us that true love never fades and even if it's somewhere buried inside us its always there inside and it shows itself when the time comes. I think that's what beak hyun woo and hae in teaches us.One thing I promise that as a viewer is that from this drama there will be some moments that we would never forget and cherish and learn from itThe cast is perfect and especially Kim soo hyun and Kim ji won nailed is.And eventough the ending is painfully beautifull , that what reality is and it gives us a message that we have a candy jar in life to full so start filling your candy jar with candies that you want.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Now, on to Queen of Tears...although it had some touching scenes, it was boring overall. I had to take severals breaks in order to finish it at all. The only reason I stuck with it is because of the ML (who by way stars in a much more captivating drama titled, ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay'.) He does an amazing job of pulling his audience in with his eyes and facial expressions. He was the saving grace of the drama.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

It might seems like normal love story but if we take a closer look it turns out to have many nuances that make sit stand out, i also like the romantic spots they have used it's different from the spots I have viewed in few kdramas I have watched, although it starts with cruel attitude of male lead which is disgusting, it was upstaged by his later attitude and reaction, female lead who over looked at her family in the beginning has also started to grow warm which upstages her earlier coldness, last but not least lots of warm moments shared with all family members are on another level.

"Korean Drama '' Queen of Tears '' is a dark comedy melodrama.The story is pretty unexpected, especially at the start of the drama, which was more on the comedy side. Slowly, they introduced the dramatic scheme involving the villain and the family, as they go through unexpected changes. Then, the series turns towards the romantic side, with many moments between the couple. The plot gets darker towards the end, with the final episode being quite dramatic. However, it must be noted that the last episodes, especially the fourteenth, were rather boring and felt more or less like fillers.Another perk for this drama was the excellent side characters that were interesting and helped the story a lot.Also, the performances were excellent.So, overall, seven out of ten.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"After a promising, funny and witty, first episode, the things changed. I am disappointed so far. It stretches too thin to be a good quality work in all directions. The plot develops as slow as a snail and full of cliches. There are lots of Kim Soo-Hyun's face close-up shots, - which is understandable since he is very beautiful- however, many of these camera freezes on his face have no substance whatsoever, - is he a model here or an actor? Also, the main female lead is so cold, lame in her feelings expressions, and unattractive as a person, and the actress is so limited in her ability to act (or not given the opportunity) that I cannot spot or feel any chemistry between them at all, even during meager romantic scenes we are given.The whole thing doesn't hold water for me, not sure will keep watching.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Kim Jiwon also did a great job.They are a sweet married couple, just so perfect.?뮏They set a standard in k-dramas now.Such a sweet couple, hoping they get married irl too?쁺
It was great drama because it perfectly potraited the after marriage life. Lack of communication can make them fall apart, can make them they are exhausted of eachother but they realise how much they love eachother during the toughest time..
This is a highly recommended k-drama, you're obviously missing something if you don't watch it!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I'm not the type of person to care about a show enough to create an account and write a review about it, but there's a first for everything!Queen of Tears takes all your common k-drama cliches and completely turns them against you. The story is absolutely flawless in its writing and execution. It perfectly encapsulates the beauty and struggle of marriage, while simultaneously visualizing the wedding vows that couples promise each other. Hyunwoo and Haein took ""for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish"" to another level. Queen of Tears reveals a stunning message about the importance of marriage, true love, family, and togetherness.The acting is beyond my imaginations. Soohyun's every move, action, and adlib is intricately performed, while Jiwon's micro-expressions and eloquence is unmatched. Their chemistry makes you think that not only the characters, but the actors, are genuinely in love with one another. Don't get me started on the rest of the cast. I could go on and on about how wonderfully they portrayed their characters.The show made me laugh out loud, bawl my eyes out, sigh in frustration, gasp in surprise, and everything in between. It's the perfect balance of romance, comedy, suspense, and tragedy. Every episode is excellently paced. It's slow enough for you to savor every heartfelt moment, but quick enough that you won't be bored. And the epilogues? My goodness. They're always the highlights to the already-immaculate episodes.Moreover, the music makes you feel like you're levitating every time you listen to it. Whether it's made for a sad or happy scene, whenever you listen to the OST, it makes you feel all the emotions all over again. They're catchy, romantic, and suit the drama perfectly.What a masterpiece of a show. It was an absolute pleasure and honor to watch.

All the difficult moments and difficulties and discomfort will be fixed in the end. I had depression and when I started this series, I enjoyed it a lot, I forgot the hardships of my life and entered the world of the series for a moment, I cried and laughed every moment and this series was able to keep me alive in these difficult and exhausting days. And do not disappoint.We were always waiting for the next episode and it was the only series that I never got tired of and never dropped. Every moment showed one of the hardships of life. How when one of the family members was not well, the others stayed by his side and finally understood and cared about him. They regretted their wrong actions and tried to forget the past and live a better life full of love and affection. To experience

This K drama is filled with laughs and tears, and a lot of suspense. There are a lot of twist and turns. The fact that you can become so in engulfed in the show by how well everyone played their part makes a big difference. I don't wanna give any spoilers because I feel everyone should have the opportunity to experience this show and it's entirety , but again If you haven't watched it already, I highly recommend it You definitely won't be disappointed.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

"This series has so many twist and turns. The love between the two and the bonds of the family which runs so deep. I have seen alot of KDrama series but nothing like this at all. The acting skills and chemistry they all have between eachother make it truly seem they are really in real life. The director did so great on this and hope to see the two main stars back together on another series or something after this one like having a family of their own with more twist to solve again. So if you definitely looking for something that's very good in mystery, drama,love,etc definitely need to watch this. If this is your first time watching KDrama that you will definitely going to watch more.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I dont get it why it has so good review, its not really my preferenceI dont see chemistry between the two especially the girl, its like everything she just take it for granted. And storyline does not make sense, today is kissing , next day become like normal friend, and the next day is crying ,and next day is like new couple in love , next day is like husband and wife . The chemistry is totally messed up. There is no love , there is no respect.The story line is predictable, boring and alot of unnecassary repeating flash back scene, dragging.Its really nothing compare to ""crash landing on you """,negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Do you believe in love ? I still do....Although Queen Of Tears will go down with a solid 8.5 out of 10 from me, it will also go down as one of the biggest ""What-Ifs"" in the drama industry.When I saw Kim Soo-hyun as part of the cast, it was an immediate must watch. Typically, Kim Soo-hyun put in a virtuoso masterclass in acting as you'd expect him to. But I knew nothing of Kim ji won. Boy, don't I know now!How do you define acting virtuoso? It may be a difficult question to answer, but let me try to answer it: when you play a character, a virtuoso performance will typically bridge the line between reality & screenplay, such that the viewer won't know who actually exists in reality - the person or the character. Kim Soo-hyun does it flawlessly yet again; if anything, I just hope to go to South Korea & pray to meet him at least once....What about Kim Ji Won? I knew nothing about her but this gorgeous white lily has absolutely blown me away. She has matched the impeccable Kim Soo-hyun moment by moment, & played such a difficult character with typical Korean poise.The series proceeded with excellent storytelling & poise till episode 11 & reached absolute crescendo in episode 12, but thereafter, episodes 13-15 felt rushed & devoid of ideas. Episodes 13-15 felt like the typical 6-rated Bollywood drama. We don't watch Korean to watch such stuff. Thankfully, episode 16 captured a lot of lost ground, with the typical Korean ending: not exactly the happy-happy type, but a poignant one. The series lost one rating point due to episodes 13-15.Eun-Soong's character looked a bit lost at times. Although the last episode gained a lot of ground (you could really feel the character in episode 16), the build up wasn't done as well as you'd expect in the Korean industry. Either the plot lines in episodes 13-15 should have been extended or should have been scrapped altogether.The OSTs don't require emphasizing. A playlist comprising of Heize, Crush & 10CM will justifiably dominate your playlists for a considerable amount of time. ?삃So this ends the 2 months' of joyride with the Kim couple. The biggest compliment? I'd look forward to Saturdays & Sundays with the same anticipation as a Real Madrid C. F. knockout tie in UEFA Champions League (like tonight!) There can be no greater compliment than this.Thank you, Baek Hyun Woo & Hong Hae In. Love you.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"This is miraculous. If you want love, drama, silliness, humor, pathos, action, villainy, decency, sacrifice and love again, this has it all. I was emotional before I even knew I was invested. Totally enjoyable. There were a few minor things in the plot that seemed unnecessary. But I always allow for stuff like that, and they do not diminish my enjoyment. I could easily rate this 10 stars, but have reserved that for those I consider pure perfection. I was hooked from the very first episode. All these actors are wonderful, their characters relatable, or at least understandable, and it's beautiful to see the story unfold in their hands.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The storyline is really great. I shaded tears many times while watching every episodes. The love between the couple enchants me from top to bottom of my heart. I was wondering that if I shall finish this series or not. Because once I finish this, I could not enjoy such a drama in future. But I couldn't preserve this series in my drama-list. Really heart-touching, excellent relationship, romance, feelings, worries, responsibilitis, friendship, formalities and also casualties. This is a great creation in Korean film industry. The most important thing that makes me more happy that this series breaks with an happy ending. If a romantic drama cannot end like this, it really breaks the heart that is unbearable. For this, I love this series most. This couple is one of my favourites.Waiting for S2!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"There is a certain air of magnificence that dramas like Crash landing on you and Descendants of the sun exhude (just two examples of the top of my head, there is more dramas like this)- and Queen of Tears has just joined the club. Though the drama contains some unnecessary cliches, overall the story is beautiful. If you liked the other two I mentioned, you certainly will like this.The story is about a married couple in crisis, where the male lead Hyunwoo (Soohyun) can't stand his wife Haein's (Jiwon) nor her overbearing rich family. The problems and miscommunication arise in the ""happily ever after"" and this drama focuses on that, how despite being in love, we can forget it with the daily problems. The story starts when the male lead wants to ask for divorce, and the female lead discovers she's dying (this is not much of a spoiler, it happens pretty much right away).Let me lead with the things I liked: Jiwon is standardly a good actress, yet I haven't watched much of Soohyun's stuff, mostly scared of overrepeating the cliches through dramas. But here, he is stellar. The range of emotions that he had to play in here, and the way he embodies Hyunwoo is incredible, I was honestly kind of annoyed at how good he is. He can probably act in anything and I will start going through his dramas and films with my eyes wide open.I absolutely loved the way this was shot. Many times the focus shifts, or the angle to the scene shifts, and it adds so much perspective. The drawings at the end of every episode, occasionally cutting the screen into an old style format, or the sceneries- beautiful! There was one scene where Haein is in the elevator with Eunsong, and the camera focuses on the mirrors showing them looking in opposite directions, although they are looking at one another- such a great shot, it remained in my mind despite watching that episode long ago.I also loved the emotional scenes, it was never over the top, and it did make me cry and smile with the characters.Things I did not like: We later find out that the male lead and the female lead accidentally met twice in the past already, but they didn't know. This trope of ""met in the childhood"" is really annoying, and it keeps repeating throughout dramas constantly. All characters, again, have so many connections, as if the whole country is no bigger than their mansion.Second, I'm a bit tired of overly perfect characters, like Hyunwoo. Oh he just happens to be handsome, intelligent, honest, kind, selfless, attractive, a lawyer, an ex marine who was great at shooting, but also in kids marines group, but also he used to box and got an award for it? Oh and did I say handsome? Luckily Soohyun gives phd-worthy performance, otherwise I'm pretty sure I'd leave the series after the second episode.On that note, this guy is aging like fine wine, and I'm talking highest primest quality french basement save for special occasions type. God bless.I also have a lot to say about pure-evil characters and how some things that happened did not make sense- but this is such a good drama that I'd rather leave it at that. It just made me feel so good and entertained watching it, and all the cliches and inconsistencies did not change my mind. I think the best word to describe this drama is ""grand"". It deserves 8-9 rating at the very least, 1 star down because, well, the cliches and incosistencies. But it's great still.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The story tells the biggest crisis this couple encountered in their lives. This crisis reminds each other and remind us not to forget the original intention of loving the person we love so much. This original intention can last a life time. The elderly Baekhyunwoo sent flowers to his wife everyday until one day he saw haiyin coming to pick him up. That was the promise they had made before. When one day only one of us is left then the other person will come out to greet us. This will not be scary at all, because we will be together.Thanks to all the great actors in this drama, you gave us a very touching love story that we will never forget.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"There couldn't be more perfect characters than these two for this K-drama. The directors did an excellent job in choosing them. I have watched countless K-dramas and never felt need to re-watch them, even my favourites. But this one ... it's just PERFECT i wanna re-watch every little details once again. Such a great work. Big thank you to the makers ,production team, directing team , beautiful cast and awesome writers for having this master piece after drama found of you this is the first drama which gave me heartwarming experience thank you for creating this love. Additionally, the soundtracks were perfectly aligned with each episode such that they stick with you and give you a feeling of warmth even as you're idling.

"The high rating makes sense because of Kim Soo Hyun's long-awaited appearance, but I find his character controversial and his acting awkward and stiff at some points. Kim Ji Won dominates the couple with her acting performance and as a more full-blooded character. The major disappointment is in the supporting characters - too many villains who stand flat. To say nothing of the grandfather, son and grandson who are so gullible and stupid that one wonders how they gained and sustained their wealth. They are utterly unconvincing. I suppose the interest stays still high because the end is, to some extent, unpredictable, which is a rarity. However, it will remain a mystery to me as I will skip the next episodes.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I cannot say enough about this K-drama. It is sweet, sad, silly, suspenseful and frustrating and I want more!The cast is phenomenal. The writing is flawless. I love those that I should love and despise those that I should despise.I have actually been re-watching from episode one each week as I wait for the next episodes. This is a winner, and everyone should watch.I must also say that the soundtrack is amazing. I really pulls the story along and I find myself humming the songs. They really stick in my mind.I'm waiting until I am alone tonight to watch the finale. So excited and nervous. I hope that we see more from these writers, directors and actors.Any chance for a season 2? This is already in my list because I will re-watch it over and over.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I don't normally write reviews. But I felt the need to do so for this one. I don't know where to begin. I'm out of words, all the emotions I felt watching this masterpiece. It left me in tears. It's called 'Queen of tears', after all. From the first episode to the very last, I was crying, laughing, then crying again. I felt angry, sad, and happy. The last time I felt all this from a show was ""Crash landing on you."" It was my number one. Now I have 2 number one cause I can't choose between them. What I can easily say is that it's one of the best kdramas I've ever watched.Best performance from all cast I wouldn't change any of them. They cast the best for each role. The chemistry between Kim Ji-Won and Kim Soo-hyun is top-notch. I will miss each and every one of them. My weekends won't be the same.If you like crash landing on you, you will definitely like this one for sure. I recommend this show 100%",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"QoT will be the best drama that I will never forget. This drama shows how someone shows their love for their lover. There was no kiss, but they succeeded in making the audience feel a real romance scene. I want to have a man like Hyunwoo! He is willing to sacrifice anything for his lover. He loves hae in so much! Good job! I give my appreciation to the actors/actresses, directors, writers and other staff for being able to create a drama this good. Crazy! Hyunwoo you deserve the most suffering character nomination. AND I'm really happy because the ending is happy.

"So, 20-somethings get married and three years later they live like strangers in the same house? Hubby afraid to go to wife's separate bedroom? Wife forgets what hubby looks like with no shirt? The usual chaebol-family dynamics, fantasy world of high end designer clothes, older women acting like Joseon-era upper class snobs, men are generally depicted as weak, to be manipulated. Poor boy rich girl story combined with terminal illness plot. Girl in this case in firm need of a redemptive arc. A side plot with a former boyfriend entering the picture, some evil caste type scheming to add to the soup. A lot of standard stuff, stir and serve.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Kim Ji-won plays Hong Hae-in who comes from a chaebol family and manages the prestigious Queens department store which she runs with cold efficiency.

After a few years of marriage they have drifted apart and he plans to divorce her but on the day he plans to tell her she also informs him she may only have months to live. The script is very well written and it has interesting side characters from both sides of the family with their own dramatic stories and a superb soundtrack to accompany them. The two leads are perfect in their roles and even when the plot gets a little silly you still believe in them and cheer for them, particularly as there are factions wishing to destroy their relationship and the company.

As the story unfolds, you find yourself completely immersed in the struggles of the protagonist, rooting for her every step of the way.But what truly sets ""Queen of Tears"" apart is its emotional resonance. The author masterfully explores themes of love, loss, redemption, and the human spirit, leaving a profound impact on the reader long after the final page is turned.In short, ""Queen of Tears"" is a triumph of storytelling that deserves nothing less than a perfect 10/10.

"First I want to say that this is only my opinion regarding this series and represents my experience that I had with k-dramas in over 150 series that I watched, so you don't need to take me serious, but you will regret it if you don't. So...This show it really is a k-dramas killer - a very dangerous show for the other shows, so if you haven't watch ""Queen Of Tears"" yet and you have a list with k-dramas to watch (a small or a very big list), I strongly recommend you to see this show at the final of your list, in top 10 or top 5. Why ? Do you ask me WHY ?! Oh, well, is very simple. Because it will RUINED ALL THE OTHER MEDIOCRE OR GOOD K-DRAMAS FOR YOU !!! That's why. And I speak the truth and and only the truth, so help me Extraordinary Attorney Woo: kayak, deed, rotator, noon, racecar, woo young woo.""Queen of Tears"" falls in a different special category of k-drama, so if you make the mistake to watch this show before other shows, or worst - besides other shows, it will put them in a very big shadow and automatically you will compare them, and trust me, this is not recommended. While on the market exist many good k-dramas with good or goodish script and good chemistry between the lead actors, having one or two, maybe three nice ost, ""Queen Of Tears"" take k-dramas to ANOTHER LEVEL - the main actors picked for this role are perfect, and the support cast as well - the story and the roller coaster between drama and comedy is perfect again - and the OSTs are just phenomenal, not one, or two, or three, but ALL OF THEM !!! - it make you listen over and over and over, and that should be illegal.This show must be put on the k-dramas Hall Of Fame if they have such of thing. This type of show only appears once in 2-3 years. The actors, the acting, the story, THE OST... is just the best of k-dramas that Korea can offer the world. And despite that one episode is 1h25m long like a movie, 16 movies of ""QoT"" is just too few...My advice: if you haven't watch a k-drama until now, please don't start with ""Queen Of Tears"" - because after staying in a mansion its hard to move in a house.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"This is like one of those shows that did everything right: the writing, casting, original soundtrack, etc. There was just the right amount of drama, suspense, romance and humour. It started off on a lighthearted note and gradually went darker and darker.The writing of the characters was brilliant and so was the development both in the characters themselves and the relationships they shared. I especially liked Hae-in's character development and how her terminal illness changed everything with her family when they found out.Familial relationships have the power to move my emotions more than romantic relationships and I found myself tearing up several times over the course of the show because of the changed familial dynamics. It was definitely an emotional rollercoaster ride and I enjoyed it a lot. Hyun-woo and his family were such a solid and stabilising presence in the show and the writers did an amazing job with showing how important it is to be kind and compassionate through their characters.However, the stand out character for me is Eun-sung. The actor who played him is incredible and his minute expressions and actions made his character quite sympathetic even though he was in fact despicable.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"As so many here stated - the production of the series is top notch. The visuals, the camera angles - everything adding up to be a mesmerising and enjoyable watch. Unfortunately, the production is the main (and only) good feature of this show, every other aspect, especially the story, is extremely lacking.1. The episodes are very uneven in their plot progression as well as invoking emotional roller-coasters. Sometimes, when the story is lacking in a film or a show, creators will overcompensate with trying to make their viewers emotional over certain parts. I am noticing a lot of that tactic here.2. There is not a single likeable or relatable character. There are parts of certain characters that are sometimes likeable / relatable, but other that that, I have not yet seen a single one of them admitting and owning up to their past mistakes or misconducts. Everyone are over the top, self-centred, greedy A-holes, to whom such a beautiful and light-hearted atmosphere of the show is not suited. It just gives off ""Uncanny valley"" effect. The villains are comical and boring; the protagonists have barely any screen-time to develop deeper connection between each other and, also, the audience.3. The initial selling point of the drama (shaky relationship between rich wife and a husband who married into her family) is soon forgotten in lieu to the villains' convoluted revenge plans. At this point in the show, there are far too many talking heads in rooms and not enough deep dives into the trauma of such selfish families, into the struggles of the protagonists - how did they come to want to marry each other, how did they grow apart (we might know the ""why"", but not the ""how"").",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Ugh I had high hopes for this and I couldn't even finish the 3rd episode.I loved the male lead in My Love From The Star, and I loved the female lead in Fight For My Way. Two of my favorite Kdramas of all time!! Unfortunately this one is nothing like either one of them. It's very soapy, like an actual soap opera with the whole rich family and the whole deal. I don't know who can relate to any of the characters, especially since I saw somewhere that this series beat Reply 1988!? Another one of my all time faves. That's just insane, clearly the metrics are different now, there's no relation whatsoever and there shouldn't even be a comparison.If it wasn't for the two leads' pretty faces, and the fact that we've been waiting a long time to see them, I don't think anyone would be interested. That's what it seems like to me at least.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"One of the most...no, this show is so predictable, cliche, boring, stupid screenplay, cheezy, cringe...first couple episodes was really good, but then...disaster. Nothing new to see, so overrated, overhyped...just pass. Only good thing is comedy side of this drama, they should stick do that genre...everything else is atrocious. Please dont watch, there is nothing to see...just bunch of naive characters, villian who have more power than president of republic, what a joke. Please stop making shows like this...we need something new, fresh, to thinking, not dramas like this one, they will make people stupid.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Disappointing when a series doesn't provide clear explanations or a satisfying conclusion to its storylines.""Queen of Tears"" delves into the intricate realm of human emotion, promising an odyssey brimming with secrecy and familial enigmas. Despite its ambitious premise, the execution fails to deliver a seamless narrative.Character trajectories, notably that of Cheon Da-hye, lack coherence and depth. While hinting at multifaceted backgrounds, they remain unexplored, rendering her actions disjointed.The series finale disappoints with rushed plotlines and lingering uncertainties. Crucial actions lack the depth required for understanding, leaving viewers to grapple with unresolved queries.In essence, ""Queen of Tears"" falls short of its potential as a compelling saga, hindered by its cryptic storytelling and unresolved threads. It underscores the importance of clarity and character complexity in captivating storytelling.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"At first I liked the whole look of the cast and the storyline, it was pretty much believable but then it turned into a hard to believe storyline after the lead female's diagnoses. Don't want to give anything away but for me personally the 4th going into 5th episodes is where this series lost me. It took a ridiculous and not very believable turn which turned me off. A story has to have some dose of reality written into it and that's where I have to stop watching. I'm trying my best to not reveal any spoilers so this may seem somewhat vague on my part but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may want to give it a watch.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
Had lot of expectations with this one but its yet another childish kdrama. I finished 3 episodes and dont think would continue further. The leads are verry good actors but are completely wasted. Loved Kim Ji-won in My liberation notes and had higher expectation here but her character is reallly badly written. The writing overall is just sub average. Serial is cramped with so many side characters that after some time i was looking at skipping there scenes. Studio Dragon dramas are slightly better. But this one is let down. Another low quality romcom in last 3/4 years. Recent serious kdrams are better like Killer Paradox and Moving. Queens is definitely a skip.,negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I made an account just to give my two cents on this godawful, horrifyingly terrible series. There were plenty of stupid moments where it didn't feel natural, like the story had to be forced into these idiotic situations just so there's something ""exciting"" going on in the next episodes. Also, tons of dumb lines like ""Mr. Yoon might've gone to the same data recovery shop."" Like, hello, Hae-in? You do know that's suspicious as all hell, but your pride just wouldn't let you see things objectively.Sets were beautiful, performances were... nothing to complain about, and plot was just infuriating. I was cheering for the villains to take Queens, for Mr. Yoon to marry Hae-in's pretty little head because God knows she's not using it, for Hyun-woo to leave that hellhole because all of his effort to save it isn't worth it.If the intention of the creators is to make me angry, then they did a damn great job. The Hong family deserved what they got going for them not because of a riveting plotline, but because of dumb characters and even dumber storytelling.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I was interested in this drama when I heard that Kim Soohyun was the main lead but I was unsure whether to watch it or not. It has been all over tiktok and everyone was talking about it like it's the best drama ever made. I finished watching ep 10 and let me tell you, it is absolutely NOT worth the hype. I have to skip the majority of scenes cause the side stories & characters are just that boring. I forced myself to like the female lead, but I just find her insufferable and to be completely honest, I'm not a fan of the actress's acting either. I think she always has the same expression and isn't that good at expressing emotions, which stands out even more because the male lead is such an amazing actor. The couple overall is boring despite their drama and issues, I couldn't find them cute or find myself invested even in their emotional and romantic scenes. I actually sometimes have to skip their scenes too. Overall I don't understand how so many people find this drama fresh and something new, when it's always the same formula, for example the lawyer male lead who acts tough but is a sweetheart and comes from a poor background but marries someone rich. The only reason why I keep watching it is to find out how the villain will end up, nothing more. Not even interested in the couple's happy ending.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I don't know what's the fuss about this series. Lead actors love story line was so weak, twist is twisting, villain is taking over the story, it's more like thriller rather than drama. The only good thing about this series is just each actor's performance.For a series about someone who's suffering from a rare disease (brain tumor or something), their story is far from being heartbreaking. 70% of this series is about the villain taking over their money.Only few episodes shows how she suffer from her disease but not showing how both characters tried to over come it.I would rather watching Grey's Anatomy for Derek & Meredith love story or Alex & Izzy love story. That's the real heartbreaking love story.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Just don't waste your time there's nothing interesting and new and the acting of the FL is just mid with no expression. Overall, everything in this drama is very typical and it has zero new features plot that will excite you for the next ep. I also did not liked how long each ep were and at this point they were just trying to add filling throughout each ep. They glamorous throughout the drama is alot but it really at nothing to the overall dynamics of the show. I would suggest to go for a better show that would worth your time and just don't get caught by all tge hype in social media. You can do better!",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Sadly, this show offers little innovation, relying heavily on the usual tropes of wealth, beauty, and envy that saturate so many Korean dramas. Beyond the visual appeal of its cast, there's little to get excited about. The storytelling disappoints deeply; it recycles the worn-out narrative of a damsel in distress rescued by her resourceful partner, reducing complex characters to mere caricatures. Furthermore, the overused plot twist of amnesia borders on the absurd, undermining any genuine emotional development-first the heroine, then the grandfather. It's a tired device that feels more laughable than impactful. And to top it off, the improbable love triangle, where a man attempts to split up a blissfully married couple, just doesn't resonate with real-life cultural contexts in Asia. It's all quite disillusioning.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Firstly, speaking as a musician, the music is utterly soulless, over-produced, sanitized garbage.Normally, that would be such an important point, but since a third of the whole show is just scenes of people staring at things, people, nothing, off into the distance, with that music playing, it really amplifies the negativity.The acting is equivalent to that of a typical low-budget soap opera. Visine must have been a key sponsor of this series since there are fake tears every few minutes. And they must have paid a lot, since because the cinematography greatly out performs everything else about the show.This show really just feels like a waste of time and money. Totally unnecessary. It's just added pollution to the world.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"As a big K drama lover I've seen a dozen or so Korean dramas/comedies. Enjoy how different it is from American sensibilities, the big emphasis on families, how slow the romantic interests are to get sexual, etc. Etc., good stuff!Gave this a solid 3 episodes to redeem itself and found myself criticizing it constantly and not enjoying the dynamics. On the surface it has many of the usual themes: the outsized importance of powerful families, the unlikely marriage between partners of different stations, the centering of everything around the family, etc. Added to that was the dramatic Mafiaesque demands of the father in law to never leave/abandon the family.But can't get over the male lead being so lacking in confidence- he obviously knows how to stand up for himself, as seen with people he's not intimidated by, and he's able to brilliantly assess/verbalize the gist of any legal or personal matter, so he has the capability. But I just have no sympathy/patience for his character not standing up for himself, even though these are super challenging situations. And it's not fun to watch how horrible the mother-in-law is. I know that's part of the Korean mindset, but I don't find it entertaining, esp when she reveals how uncaring she is for her own daughter and prefers the younger son. And creating a best friend and sister that is always about the money and influencing the lead in that direction, just seemed shallow and out of place for the lead, who didn't seem that way.I found the fist episode very amusing, it was so over the top with the usual sappy love dynamics, and realized that the story had just covered a lot of ground very quickly to establish the prologue. And the ice temperament of the main female lead, that was ok as well, that gives the story someplace to grow, just glad she wasn't a dangerous psychopath like the best friend in MARRY MY HUSBAND.I blame this on the scriptwriters/casting director/producers/director. While the actor obviously has a wide-range, the writing and directing and conception is way off, personally I'd never green light such a simplistic story. Apparently this is aimed more for Korean audiences, which I assume is where the 8+ rating on IMDB comes from. Like many shows, it can take awhile before the appeal is completely obvious, but for me 3 episodes is enough, this show gets a double thumbs down, it's frustrating and awful watching how small a thoroughly competent guy makes himself. It's bad enough that he's living with and surrounded by this awful in-law family, but to have absolutely no one on his side is way off for me.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Very bad plot. Only the acting are good. People keep saying the male lead is green flag but i was shocked when he is happy to know his wife would die. He also pretending in front of her. The wife is also a bad person who doesn't respect her husband. So what if she actually adores him from behind? In his perspective, she is still a wife who doesn't have an ounce of respect towards him and treating him like a slave. Not only that, the plot also focuses more on the villain who succeed their plans every single time. It's not a romcom at all, totally a makjang especially with how out of sudden she is cured from cancer. In the beginning it was portrayed as if it's impossible LOL.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I am talking about episode 3. Why would a CEO that is so full of confidence and very intelligent listen to such an a-hole friend who wanted to break their marriage. If this show is near to the truth of Koreans, I don't want to go there anymore. Their dramas are so full of betrayals and unfairness. It's not a nice place to go and live. At least write a plot that is nearer to the truth of rhis world. The actors are over the top but I don't like the plot. Those people like that a-hole needs a vigilante that would torture him and punish him in a very painful way that he himself would forget his own name. I would love to see a drama that does that.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"The bigger the expectation, the bigger the disappointment. I fell asleep during the second episode. I tried to pick it up and watched until episode 6, hoping the plot and characters would somehow become interesting, then gave up. Extremely boring and poorly written script. The aesthetics are great otherwise but the dialogues are awful. I dont know what all the hype is about? This drama was highly anticipated because come of the lead actor's popularity (KSM is currently the highest paid Korean actor). Such a waste of money and talent here that could have been better spent on a better scriptwriter.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"""It was a really good series, but the writer or director decided to end the whole world in the last minute. They could have ended the drama happily with the birth of a daughter, but instead, they chose to make her die and aged the protagonist, leading to the end of the world.""
Felt let down and confused. What began as a promising story turned dark and hopeless at the end. Many wondered why the writer or director chose such a grim path, especially after building up hope throughout the series. It was disappointing who had spent so much time following the characters, only to be left feeling empty and dissatisfied.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"First 8 episodes were good ?몟 ,later felt very bad after seeing hae in again started to hate baek woo hyun after knowing his true love for him because of the divorce papers prepared by him. How can she forget the beautiful moments spent by them before by just one incident. I have watched this drama after watching it's okay to be not okay and qot was not worth watching as i had lot of expectations on the story,it didn't match them. The drama was also too emotional and was too common story that their own family people decieved them and finally get back their company. Hae in was potrayed as extremely heartless and loving too. How can one be so loving and turn heartless to torchure him at that extend??",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
I was looking forward to this since i like crashed landed on you but this is far worse than that its a very typicial studio dragon drama. I dont know whos descision it was to make the episodes 1+hr it really drags on. The story is nothing special unlike his other works it has so many plot holes more than most k dramas ive seen. Most charaters lack depth the main villians whole life was to get with the main charater and its hardly explained why he likes her so much.The acting from the main female character was good actually but the male lead was bad he shows zero emotions on his face.It follows all studio dragon dramas ive seen they care so much for the aesthetics and product placement than story.,negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"I have been a huge fan of k-dramas for a while now. Whats not to like? Its a roller coaster of emotions. They make me cry, laugh, cringe and most of all smile. I've seen good, i've seen bad, and I've seen great.That brings us to the queen of tears, a drama that has recycled every single plot twist known to k-drama writers. And i mean every single one. There is absolutely nothing original in this one, and i was rolling my eyes in disbelief so hard on so many occasions at the lack of imagination of the writers.I was on the verge of stopping more then once. Than i came on imdb, checked the score and the reviews, got befuddled and thought i will miss out on something huge because so many of you wrote so highly about the show. So I endured. Every time. Many times.But guess what, nothing huge happened. Nothing but my disappointment. This was one huge oversell.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
I don't know what happened to Studio Dragon. There was a time you could rely on them for good stories with good actors. That time is past.This writer is simply following in the footsteps of hundreds that have gone before her. Her heroine (Hae-in) is a CEO of a huge company founded by her grandfather - her brother is not as intelligent as she is and is jealous of her. He is married but his wife has nothing but contempt for him and the child they have together is not his. In a scene of typical over the top portrayal of this we see him trying to ride a bike with stabilisers and later falling off said bike several times in the silliest unbelievable fashion.Hae-in's husband is Woo - a man from a much poorer family. And what a family - every one of them wants to use him for their own benefits. The son looks older than the father.After a couple of years of happiness the rot sets in - Hae-in is terminally ill and her personality is cold and hard and ruthless towards Woo. He is desperately depressed and unhappy and wants a divorce. The trouble is that he doesn't know whether he loves her or hates her.There is the usual big business machinations and betrayals - this family are portrayed as being so stupid that one has to wonder how on earth they became successful in the first place.I stopped and started a lot in this series - more than any other - the situations were so silly and unbelievable and contrived and deliberately extended with pointless conversations that led nowhere.There is a scene regarding a divorce lawyer (Vincenzo?) Played by Song Joon Ki. - but it is treated in a humorous fashion which is totally out of keeping with the subject. One wonders what a star of his magnitude is doing in such a minor role in this.The script is awash with people not explaining themselves and misunderstandings which are totally obvious and unnecessary.It is hard to have sympathy with Hae-in - she comes across as a nasty selfish narcissistic piece of work - one is sorry for Woo and wonders why he perseveres with her. For a brilliant lawyer he is portrayed as a man who cannot express his feelings and who simply stares with tears in his eyes instead of opening his mouth and explaining himself. He wouldn't last a minute in a courtroom.The writer is not good enough to make you understand why - maybe because she doesn't know a trope that works in this regard.The episodes are far too long for the content and stretched out with needless scenes with his repulsive family. Once again food is featured unnecessarily - South Korea has a fixation with food and scenes with people filling their mouths to capacity litter their series.Studio Dragon really needs to hire new writers with new ideas before they offer any more inferior series like this one.,negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
"Boring conflict! Half-hearted comedy, overly dramatic romance. A very stupid rich family, if there was no Hyuwoo in this family then the Queen Family would have absolutely nothing.When the villain started to enter the story, I even guessed how this drama would go next. It's very tiring to see the Queen Group always being deceived and trusting strangers who enter their house. Then Hae In's character is really tiring for Hyunwoo. How could she decide to marry him but act bossy like that? If I were Hyunwoo then Hyunwoo's decision to divorce him was correct. It would be better if they fought after the divorce, then for some reason got back together again. But it's not because of a terminal illness or anything, the reason is too cliche.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
