tt10919420,"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Squid Game is a show that will stay in your mind long after you watched it. After reading all the great reviews and seeing it was one of the most watched series in the entire world I finally found time to watch Squid Game. I have to admit that I had fun watching it and was very entertained throughout the entire season. It's about hundreds of contestants (who are all down on their luck and need money) that are asked to play children's games for an shot at winning a lot of money, 45.6 billion won (about 33 million dollars). The only thing is these children games are now all deadly and the last contestant standing wins all the money. It will pull you into its world and before you know it you'll be hooked. It's a thriller with lots of twists and lots of violence. I know it's already been renewed for another seasons so I hope they can keep the same magic they had for season one.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.Examples (spoilers!)1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.The gameThe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.""Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.The island, the leader and the policemanThe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.The secondary playersBetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...The old man and the main characterFinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"This show starts out amazing, and progresses amazingly too. The characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. There were moments that made me cry, which I wasn't expecting. There was a point around the middle of the season where I was ready to call this the best TV show of the decade.And then the VIPs came in.Their acting was atrocious, like The-Room-level bad. I was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. My only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in American dialogue. Not only did the VIPs break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of Hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.However, this didn't destroy the show for me, and I could have overlooked it. But then the show just sort of fell apart logically. First there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where I was just wondering throughout the entire thing: Why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? Why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?And finally, Sae-Byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. What was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? It angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. And maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but I feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. It's almost like the show said, ""Yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with.""Then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between Seong Gi-Hun and Mr. I'm-Completely-Selfish-Until-the-Plot-Demands-I-Sacrifice-Myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where Player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover VIP the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and Seong Gi-Hun); and then Seong Gi Hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the VIPs or something.I wouldn't have minded Sae-Byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. I wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. It's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.I still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and I can't overstate that. I sat back in awe many times and said, ""This is one of the best scenes in TV history."" I will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. There was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that I felt bored or disinterested. I feel like this show raises the bar for Netflix and I'm glad I watched it.I just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. If it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. And it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

In general though this is definitely worth a watch.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"The acting and character development from the main cast is outstanding! The storyline was AMAZING. I was hooked straight away.It would have received a 10 if the VIP acting was better, they were shockingly bad and sometimes hard to ignore.And there were also little things that were never finished/explained:
The coughing morse code from 28 to 29.The battery life of 29's phone, even the leader uses a landline.The police chief definitely caught some of what the police guy (29) was saying on the phone. Why was no back-up whatsoever sent to his location?Why did the last guy give up after just being bit in the leg but 456 was stabbed twice and able to fight and win? I'm guessing that he just gave up and wanted 456 to win?The married couple that returned and acted shocked that only one of them could leave alive. They knew there could only be one winner in the end.I was super gutted that the girl was randomly impaled by glass (why did they blow up the glass, it could have killed all three finalists, risking losing a final winner).Was 001 called number 1 as he was secretly the winner. Did he secretly want to let 456 win? Did he allow it to happen? Isn't that going against the ""fairness"" of the games?456 winning Squid Game as a child in the first scene in the pilot episode, totally ruined the series, I KNEW that would be the final game, so it was OBVIOUS he was going to win. I still enjoyed the ride, but it was something that at least should have had a flash back too during the last game, as I haven't seen anyone else make this comment; did they forget about it?His hair looked awful red. That is all.Why did he suddenly become impulsive and want to hunt down the gamers? Will their be a season 2? I don't understand how he thinks he can take them down; the police don't believe him and the leader/VIPs are billionaires so can hide everything/kill everyoneHe abandoned his daughter AGAIN.He was going to ditch the prize money AGAIN.When the first group of people were released, the prize money was meant to go to the bereaved families, but when the majority returned, the prize money remained. Does this mean they were lying? (because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?The leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if I'm correct, nothing came of this? I was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?One of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? I was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. Bit disappointed with that.How did that annoying woman survive? When asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? But she was a weak underdog? That makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?The police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), I kept thinking ""chuck it in the water so they're thrown off"" but no, he left it there and was easily found.Another police man one... He was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. His brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. How does this work? Or had he only ""disappeared"" during the latest games. This definitely needed more explanation.Now that I think about it, there were A LOT of plot holes, but during watching it and before I started analysing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and likely watch again! I love geeking out like this; that's how I know when I've loved something; when I can't stop thinking and analysing it!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color?

tt10919420,"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians.

Hindi dubbing was far better than perfect. The dual element of entertainment was suspense & production design.Marvel's Loki is much better than this.

From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable. Yes there will be a second, and yes I will watch it because the actors are superb. But it still is not in the class of finest KDramas.However.

tt10919420,"*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,The basic idea behind the show isn't really out of the world about how you have to compete to death to gain something but the twisted fact that the show turns children's games to their ugliest and gorriest possible versions makes it a horrifying yet glued to Netflix kind of a watch.

tt10919420,"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.As for the show, it is a great show.

The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all.

Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful.

This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series.

tt10919420,"Everybody has been talking about ""Squid Game."" I've been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn't feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don't watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched ""Squid Game"" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it's meh.To me it's a Korean ""Hunger Games."" I know that there are some big differences, but it's still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we're all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it's a victim of its own hype, but I wasn't that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn't want to be in, but I will say that some of the 'umph' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I've labeled this spoiler so I'll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it's a dead giveaway that they're going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to ""Squid Game"" I say ""Meh."" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn't interest me enough. If ""Squid Game"" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would've been a lot better.

As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more.

The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth.

And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game?

He could've helped so many people, instead he sat in a corner feeling sorry for himself for a whole year, pathetic! Then when he pulls himself together (red hair and all) he backtracks at the last minute and decides oh I'm gonna undo all my character development and do the stupid impulsive thing instead!

tt10919420,"Not sure what all the hype was about. The most enjoyable thing about this show is watching all of the horribly unlikable characters get killed off. The only problem with this is that as more and more people got killed, it provided more screen time for the rest of the unlikable characters.

tt10919420,"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Not bad, but it's being a bit too over hyped. Seen better, seen worse.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,Koreans don't hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan's Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the ""losers"" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers ""side-hustle"" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the ""real"" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed ""worthless"".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but ""manga"" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"The writing, acting and almost everything else about it was so captivating and entertaining. I love the characters and the way that they make you feel so attached. Episode 6 is truly heartbreaking in terms of this aspect.The music was another thing I enjoyed. I can't quite put my finger on why the music was so perfect. It just... was.Although the acting of the white actors wasn't anywhere near as good the acting in the rest of the series, the rest of the show made up for itOverall a great show and I would recommend.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt11612120,"It might just be me, but the older I get, the less able, or willing, I am to grapple with multiple apparently unconnected characters doing apparently unconnected things. Season 1 is great. A close-knit group of people surviving a monster outbreak in a single, claustrophobic environment, where (as the title suggests) home becomes somewhere strange and terrifying. Monsterization is closely linked to human desire. Every monster is unique, and almost sympathetic. But inevitably, the filmmakers decide to expand the storyline, go bigger, move outside those constraints. The Matrix did it. Countless zombie movies and shows have done it. But it rarely seems to work. Involving the military might seem logical, but it kills the uniqueness of the premise, and turns an intense, personal drama into yet another generic post-apocalyptic mess. Monsters look the same, hunt in packs, have no personal connection to the main characters. Lots (I mean lots) of guns. And by the end of season two, I have no idea what's going on. Like I said, that might be me, but I don't think so. It's as if they're throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Not much, I'm afraid. I really hope season 3 goes back to a smaller, more intense storyline, but I doubt it.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"The first season was definitely worth watching. I'm trying to figure out why the 2nd season lost it all, as I fell inlove with the 1st season, but ended up finding nothing worth caring about in the 2nd.And as it turns out... The plot of this show was actually based on it's original webtoon. The 2nd season's storyline doesn't take place in the webtoon, as expected...It seems like the show was taken over by a whole different set of creators.During season 1, the monsters and their encounters were much more intense, captivating and so much more interesting. The whole setting was claustrophobic, and quite challenging in itself. It was all very suited for this imaginative horror show.... In season 2 that's what I was most disappointed about. It seemed like the monsters didn't belong in the same horrifying universe anymore, and they were no longer a major part of the story.Why shift so much focus onto constant drama between a variety of uninteresting, unlikeable, unbearable characters? It's frustrating how nobody is getting along. Everyone argues, slaps and punches each other. Never-ending bitterness, tension and moody whining through it all..? Liking someone apparently means being inlove with a person who doesn't care about your existence at all. Too many are simply heartlessly cruel, as well.What is there to love about the show, anymore? Is it just meant to get watched, not meant to be enjoyed?I'd recommend season 1, but to ignore that there's more episodes after. All we can do now is hope that season 3 might find it's way back and somehow remember how it was meant to entertain, or perhaps some of us should just go ahead and read the webtoon instead.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

In the other I cried for that character and prayed for him/her not to die. I loved watching them become a family.

Eun-yoo basically replaced ji-soo as the female protagonist, while in the first season she was just a child now she's magically become this strong woman. NO. I WON'T ACCEPT THIS. I AM BEYOND ANGRY AT THE PRODUCERS AND THE WRITERS BEHIND THIS. The actress didn't have time to shoot? You put a scene where you give hope to people and maybe try to shoot more for season 3 AND GIVE HER CHARACTER THE ATTENTION SHE DESERVE.Honestly I don't even care what happens next, they had more money but some monsters are still awfully made, the intro sucks compared to the first one and the main themes were better in the first season, nothing can compare to WARRIORS by imagine dragons.I'm sorry but season one remains the best.

Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they'll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Yes, the CGI isn't the best, but it's also not the worst I've seen either.
The core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can't help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons ""Warrior."" I can't really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second.

tt11612120,"Sweet Home (2020) is a Korean horror television series available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a virus outbreak that turns people into monsters. The storyline evolves around a group of survivors inside a residential high rise building while chaos takes place outside.The writing for this is very inconsistent. The first four episodes were out of this world A+ action and horror scenes. It was so fun. I thought this show was Amazing out of the gate. However, the storyline quickly shifts from the cool monsters to the humans hybrids and their conflicting feelings about the surviving humans. Overall this series had a lot of potential and falls apart halfway through.

I'm not sure if this is Netflix's fault or not, but their shows often go downhill in following seasons. They change too much for the worst. I have been fast forwarding a lot of season 2 because the dialogue is so boring I can't even focus on it. I'll probably eventually finish it just to see how it ends. But I will continue to fast forward a lot.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Season 1 was great, a novel and entertaining season. Season 2 however has a lot of what made S1 great now is missing.One of the biggest problems I have with the show is the protagonist. He turns half monster for the entire season, but other than the healing ability he is completely and I mean COMPLETELY useless compared to other monsters. The first problem is that he will not fight. He will stand there and take punches, hits, stabs cuts and wont lift a finger to fight back because he doesnt want to hurt people. Talk about ridiculous. On top of that they tried to give him some monster ""wings"" so that he can fly around with these monster wings on his back, but guess what""? They literally only gave him ONE wing on his back. You dont have to be an aerospace engineer to know that one big wing on only one side of your back wont work and shouldnt fly, but of course it somehow works. It looks ridiculous though. I am sure they thought it was going to look cooler than it did. All of those things really annoyed me about this season but what really got on my nerves the most was him crying. He is crying in every single episode he is in. Multiple times, and he cries and cries and cries. This is an adult man who is supposed to be a monster but instead cries like a baby all the time. They destroyed this character and had the chance to make a character that was cool powerful an strong yet we got this mess. What a disaster!!The entire second season is lackluster also in comparison to the first. The story is all over the place in S2 and bounces around a bit too much.Other than all that negative stuiff, the show IS still entertaining. Some of the monsters are interesting but the CGI this season was much worse than the first season. This season we got monsters that look like transformers made of garbage (they show up in a few episodes). They make the monsters move intentionally very fast so that the camera doesnt zoom in on how poor the cgi truly is this season. The is entertainment value to this show still!!

tt11612120,"6 stars I am giving only for season 1 which had its unique charm about it and not being like all the other zombie shows out there. Although having limited characters, each had their own back story and were given a chance to develop in their own way throughout the season. Every monster was great and different (coming from they're own personal desire). So all this was good about season 1
season 2: remaining characters from season 1 are transported to this stadium for some time where there are 400 more people and it is really hard to catch up with everybody's motives. In the process of focusing on these other characters, plus the ""Crow"" army people (they're good guys fighting the monsters), the main characters are either killed off or given very less screen time. Believe me when I say this, but even the main guy (who's face is on the poster and who is supposed to be a ray of hope in this dark time) has less screen time. Monsters became mediocre and less scary, most with a generic zombie look. The cute kid became a bully, the nerd guy became a gambling moron, a prominent girl from s1 is killed off early into the season, the ballet girl is lost in her own mission to find her brother. I don't even remember what happened to the others but this season wasn't memorable at all
all in all, I think s3 will probably get cancelled if this is how s2 went. A lot of fans are upset as I am.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Hard to really describe the show. Its definitely fun and entertaining. The CGI tends to be a bit crappy, if the monsters were more ""consistent"" their CGI being low quality would be more forgivable.Main flaw with the monsters ""consistency"" is just how conveniently you don't see any, at all, for the longest time it fits for the so-so storyline at the time. In S2, they're just so uncommon, no country on earth would struggle to finish them off. S2 the monsters would struggle to compete with any small redneck US street nevermind trained Korean military.On the other hand some of the ""monsters"" they create but probably don't use brilliantly have so much potential.It gets so many things right but also fails drastically at other times.

tt11612120,"The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There's a decent amount of CGI that's hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot.
One of things that's a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it's a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it's okay to consume that much time.
The monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we'd have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities.
The story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that's just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don't know, and the show doesn't end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers. I might not even watch it, answers or not.
But overall, something slightly different to watch. I thought that it was visually really good, great music/sound too! Watch this if you're bored and have nothing else to watch. 10 hours is a lot of commitment.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That's not what's odd. What's odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it's a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it's bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who's who and what they're doing and who's brave, who's a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you're going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what's up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I'm three episodes in and I can't tell yet.

There is too much military involved, it's just another action show, with no interesting plot, boring dialogues and characters.

tt11612120,"SWEET HOME is a South Korean TV show from 2020 now available for viewing on Netflix. It's based on a 'web toon', whatever that is, and I went into it with a few reservations that were quickly blown away from the end of the first instalment. This ten-episode, hour long series explores the lives of a group of residents at a tower block who wake up one day to find the world destroyed and rampaging mutated monsters killing anyone who ventures out of doors. Even worse, some of their own are infected and in the process of becoming monsters themselves!Handsomely shot and mounted, this possesses all of the quality acting you expect from Korean cinema and television, and the realistically-drawn character portraits of people you don't always like or love but who ring true to life: the conflicted, suicidal teenager; the stroppy guitarist; the masculine firefighter; the scarred gangster with a talent for torture. Interesting character development is interspersed with outlandish action and fight scenes every episode as the dwindling characters encounter one nightmarish creation after another. The CGI effects aren't meant to be photorealistic but I grew to love them anyway as they fit the show's fantastic landscape. Twisty, turning, surprising and grisly, with a consistent quality from beginning to end, this might well be the TV show of the year.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"I really liked it. To be honest, at first she was confused, I didn't know what she was watching... it was difficult for me to adapt. But little by little, I got hooked, and I couldn't stop.The entire cast is great, SongKang...omg... I already liked him, but in this series I really fell in love with his work. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE ACTOR. I really enjoyed the soundtrack too.It's not my usual kind of thing, it's not for everyone cuz it's quite raw and rough....but if you give it a chance you'll discover a great work. The next seasons are really promising. It looks like they will be wild and insane.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Sweet Home stands as a gripping testament to the power of the horror genre in Korean television, weaving a tale that is equal parts heart-wrenching and terrifying. With its intricate storytelling, well-developed characters, and stunning visuals, the series takes us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions while exploring the very essence of humanity in the face of monstrous adversity.Explores the complexities of human nature under extreme circumstances. The narrative unfolds as reclusive loner Cha Hyun-soo, portrayed with remarkable depth by Song Kang, finds himself thrust into a nightmarish scenario when his apartment complex turns into a breeding ground for monstrous creatures. From the outset, the series establishes a foreboding atmosphere, intensified by the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that expertly complements the unfolding horror.Huge commitment to character development. As the residents of the apartment complex grapple with their worst fears manifesting into grotesque creatures, the series meticulously explores the humanity that persists within them. Each character is meticulously crafted, revealing layers of vulnerability, resilience, and darkness. Song Kang's portrayal of Cha Hyun-soo is a revelation, as he seamlessly transitions from a tormented soul to a reluctant hero, carrying the emotional weight of the narrative on his shoulders.The monsters aren't just physical entities; they are embodiments of the characters' inner demons. The creature design is both nightmarish and imaginative, adding a unique flavor to the horror genre. The CGI and practical effects are executed with such finesse that the monsters become an integral part of the narrative, heightening the stakes and intensifying the terror.The pacing of the series is commendable, balancing moments of intense horror with poignant character interactions. It doesn't rely solely on jump scares; instead, it crafts an atmosphere of dread that lingers, making every moment fraught with tension. The series isn't afraid to delve into psychological horror, exploring the darkest corners of the human mind as characters grapple with the consequences of their choices in the face of annihilation.Sweet Home also excels in its thematic exploration of survival and the blurred lines between humanity and monstrosity. It poses thought-provoking questions about the lengths individuals are willing to go to in order to survive, and the sacrifices they make along the way. The moral ambiguity of certain characters adds layers of complexity, making it challenging for us to pass easy judgments.Visually, the series is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the eerie beauty of the decaying apartment complex and the gruesome transformations of its inhabitants. The juxtaposition of moments of quiet despair with frenetic action sequences creates a dynamic viewing experience.The series doesn't shy away from addressing societal issues either. Amidst the horror, it explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the resilience of the human spirit. It reflects the anxieties of the real world through its fictional narrative, making it a socially relevant piece of storytelling.This one is a triumph in the horror genre, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in Korean television. It weaves a narrative that is as emotionally resonant as it is terrifying, with stellar performances, masterful storytelling, and a visual aesthetic that leaves a lasting impression. For those seeking a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche in the face of unimaginable horrors, Sweet Home is a must-watch that transcends the confines of its genre.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive. However, this season felt more like the introduction, as we start to get to know each character and bond with them, without, nevertheless, getting too deep into the mystery of what is happening and why and how to move forward. Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline.

tt11612120,"The first season was pretty cool, it wasn't my favorite show by any means and i thought it had a lot of problems as far as just kinda odd cartoonish character moments, but thats the thing is some of its best moments could have been described that way too, but when that applied to the drama rather than the action and horror, it took me out of certain moments, where things just seemed a bit childish and melodramatic. Darkness for its own sake. Still, i thought it had a unique world and i like the weird noticeable CG monsters that don't try to hard to look perfectly real, i find them more visually interesting than monsters in plenty of other series or movies i'd consider better overall. So season 1 got a 6 from me, and im a rather harsh reviewer. Season 2 however, went down the drain VERY quickly. I can't even describe how much happened in this season that i didn't care about. I made it through 3-4 episodes because there were some interesting monsters that held my interest and a few interesting moments with main characters. Around there i realized there was suddenly just a LOT going on that i did not care about at all, and i just felt i had to skip some scenes to get through, it was all these military guys just being dicks to eachother, very boring. I basically fast forwarded through the last half and the end seemed frankly stupid to me. Other reviews i checked out agreed that this was mostly just chaotic pointless filler, its wild to me they filmed a whole other season already as well, because this is BAD. Skip this one.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"First of all, I want to say, both the ""perfect"" reviews and the ""abysmal"" reviews both miss the mark. This show is a great ""middle-of-the-road"" experience. It's concepts are great, and in the same breath, the writing is terrible in a way that is really entertaining to tease poking fun. The effects are awesome while the characters are hilariously aching anime/manga clichés. Great emotion with wafer-thin development, and so on and so forth. I would recommend you check it out, but go in with an attitude that this isn't one of those Netflix masterpiece offerings or absolute trash despite how much people want it to be one or the other.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"I read the webcomic as it came out, and have loved it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a Netflix adaptation, I was skeptical, but excited to see what they decide to do with it. If you're like me, you'll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his 'monster' way more frequently. The adaptation should've more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don't exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it's a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn't here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn't get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I'm surprised they didn't include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I'm uncertain where they'll take this, but I'll keep my hopes up for now.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Non stop action, monsters, drama, and gore! This is a wonderful example of Korean creativeness and how far TV shows have come. I am starting to become a fan of Korean acting, especially in Sweet Home, where everyone has a story that slowly unfolds with each episode and nobody are who they seem. The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects. The latter episodes include a few more emotions and tears but the entertainment is still there -- you can't have all action and no back story for the entire season. All in all I really enjoyed it.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Season 2 is like a garbage piling in our rooms but we are just not throwing it out and just watching it or ignoring it.Honestly saying Season 2 was rubbish, Very bad in storytelling, Please dont ask me about characters because for them there are only bad/cursed words in my mouth, talking about mail lead(one wing man) I want to say that just what is his character he has power but dont use it, keep standing and crying and literally do the foolishest things you and I will do if we get those powers. Frankly saying I was waiting the whole second season to watch him do something, my mind was saying that now is the time when he will make a god-like entry but I was foolish to think that I can expect anything good from NETFLIX and finally talking about female leadssssssssss(Sorry my mouth is getting out of control.....BAD WORDS INCOMING....)

Too less shown of strong female characters of a real fighting with monsters. It was toooooo slow with action time . Just the army members fighting . Where are the people like on season one ? And lastly ... what's wrong with Cha hyun su screen time ? It was going fine in the beginning but then he disappeared for like 2-3 episodes not showing him at all. He has just a few lines and went from the special monster to a one of them and not even the strongest one as he should have been . The young girl took his place as now she is the biggest special one . I had hopes but I don't know how S3 is going to be . I only enjoyed the last episode of the whole new season, when finally the lead actor are on screen .

I can imagine that if i haven't read the webtoon, I wouldn't finish the first episode. Bad CGI (the monsters are not scary at all and more like stop motion dolls), very bad acting and directing.

tt11612120,"Man, this show was something, I definitely recommend it to every horror fan out there. It's a fresh take on the tired zombie-siege formula with a great set of characters, great performances ans most importantly fantastic monster designs used in creative set-pieces.If I would have rated this after the first 3 episodes, this would have been an easy 9, unfortunately the show can't keep the pace and sharp writing of it's opening up and deflates to an extend. The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn't have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.
Also rules are very inconsistent, first it's a big deal that monsters can't be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Updated review after finishing watching season 2. I thought it was one of the saddest yet beautiful shows I've ever watched, there was a lot of tear jerking moments for me and I'm not someone who gets emotional often. The story is basically people are turning into random monsters and follow a group of survivors in an apartment building. I would say it falls under horror but there is some light humour thrown in as well. There is good deal of drama in the mix, a couple of times I did actually cry something I don't do often. It is very well acted the story is great so far and there is a good balance of action and character building. I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good. The one negative i have is on the most part the effects are good but the CGI is great in places and then terrible in others. But I can't recommend this enough, now that being said season 2 just seems to be lacking something, I'm assuming it written by a different team because it just isn't as good it seems to swing more towards intense action with monster in it. They kill off characters we came to enjoy in the first season because you know why not? And introduce a bunch of new characters that take up the majority of the screen time after the first 3 episodes, im assuming they did this to speed up production, but it just takes the focus away from the characters that they have built a good amount of character development up with, (the few that are left from season 1) It's still some what enjoyable however I just feel the writing has let it down hopefully it will pick up in season 3.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

You never knew what the next monster would be and each one was unique based on the whole monsterization curse.Everything a new one showed up itnwas exciting to see what it could do.All of the characters where well thought out and you got a good sense of who they where as it went on.Season 2 is not bad but feels like a completely different show. The first part follows the original group and is really tense even has a shock moment. All leading up to the frankly epic stadium moment.Then it jumps forwardHalf the original characters are gone and apart from a couple of standouts the monsters have all become generic CGI blobs.One scene with the army group fighting a horde with cut and paste versions if the same monster took everything away from the unquie ideas.It mostly revolves around said army groups squabbles and chest beating.

And as is usual with Netflix, the dubbing is really bad.

tt11612120,"Based on my research the comic series or webtoon etc... only covers the time in the apartment to their escape, with an ending of being in a military camp.My research is primarily from Wikipedia and the show is loosely based on those events in the first season.I didn't wish to ruin my experience of the show but by the end of the third episode in season two I simply couldn't watch it all. It's basically an entirely new show with a plethora of new characters with no background or development to them the few remaining characters from the first season are either dead or not a focal point, of the main plot which becomes focused on chaos and an autocratic military government and ""civilian"" morons most of whom totally new as I mentioned.I'd personally stop watching by the end of one though it leaves on somewhat of a cliffhanger that basically crashes.Season 2 the episodes are not only fragmented without character development they are 20-30 minutes longer than season 1.I advise this for nearly all programs good or bad to watch in the native language (Korean) and the subtitles.

tt11612120,"I had second thoughts about starting it but after the first two episodes it just got better and better. I do think that Asian horror series and movies are kind of too much about their ""horror scenes"" but this isn't the case here. Although it has some scenes to prove its theme there isn't much attention paid to them. I really liked the plot and I loved the different details and personas of every character. The whole series is fascinating and keeps you on edge all the time. It's like every episode ends with a cliffhanger. The background stories of the characters are very interesting and I liked how the series although it has a dark theme it pays much attention to the relationships and emotions among humans. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes horror-action series.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"I was so impressed with the first couple of episodes!
Didn't expect anything and loved the wierd, quirky residents of the building. And then the monster came - and man are they awesome!! Totally could see it as a video game ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill.
BUT around half way through it felt like they had fired all their good shots - less monsters, and mainly people sitting around /talking /crying or fighting each other. (maybe they were out of budget?!)
10* for the first half and 5-6* for the second.All together still very watchable",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Most of reviews here do not do justice to this show. The story is great, the character development is also compelling and really amazing CGI and visual effects.*Second*
Story is gripping and it's a roller coaster ride. This show will make you go through lots of emotions. This show gives me the anime *Parasyte* vibe.*Third*
Give this show a chance and watch it all the way it's a great one. Not in a single episode it felt like the show was dragging or was adding unnecessary fillers or anything unrelated to the story.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"The idea of this series is great. Instead of zombies you get people turning into these crazy monsters. First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn't the usual stuff. It's like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough. I'm not sure how adding a season 2 would go with so many good characters now gone. At least for me everybody I liked was dead at the end so there was no point to watching the story further. I guess it really did hit a walking dead point.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"This show caught me immediately when I watched the first season a few years ago. I found the concept unique and fascinating, and the focus on a tight knit community and their personal struggles gave each encounter with the mysterious horrors they were facing a sense of weight and gravitas. These initial episodes were beautifully paced, giving each character's personality time to shine, and giving plenty of moments of heartfelt levity to balance the brutality. Throughout the course of the season, I grew to know each of the characters and care about what happened to them. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about season 2, and even rewatched all of season 1 when it came out, in order to refresh my memory. The shift in tone between seasons was immediately evident. Gone was the thoughtful, character-centric storytelling, in favor of over the top action sequences full of bland monsters, countless non descript soldiers with big guns and flame throwers, car chases that would be at home in a Vin Deisel movie, and plenty of uninteresting new characters that never show much more personality than a wet paper sack.Even the season 1 characters lost their personality this season. There was nothing to distinguish them from the faceless mobs around them, and no moment to breathe with them and get to know them on a deeper level. It was simply a rush from one disaster to another, with nothing in between except some screaming and sobbing. Even when they killed off some of my favorite characters in cheap and unsatisfying ways, I found that I didn't really feel anything. They just didn't even seem like the same people I had gotten to know in the first season.I really wanted to like season 2. I tried very hard to. The storytelling was simply half baked and didn't give the audience a chance to connect with the charcters before sending them into disaster after disaster. Season 1 seemed to grasp that the bad stuff hits way harder when there's some good stuff and human connection mixed in. I wish the writers of Season 2 had picked up on that, and I really hope that Season 3 fixes that mistake.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

I can't comment on dubbing other than don't use it for anything, ever.It's an interesting take on the zombie/monster genre. But if you get interested by the first few episodes you might later regret feeling the need to stick through and see how it ends. By the last few episodes I was losing interest. Several characters are intolerable. Some likable characters are sidelined. Some events are over the top to the point that it's frustrating. It sometimes goes too far on pointless shock value, and other times not far enough. It's not a terrible show if you're looking for monster/horror/apocalypse/survival, but I found it getting old by the end.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"As a Webtoon long time fan, I just had to watch this, and I can say, I am not disappointed. Characters are just amazing, great representation of human interaction in specific horrifying circumstances, lovely depiction of fight from average, normal people you could likely meet anywhere, great action, fun, there is also a lot of humor, and the story is just amazing. It has horror, sf and comedy elements, but it also has deeper meaning, much more than surface deep horror, it makes you think. There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight. Granted, CGI effects are not much, as production does not seem expensive, but I still loved it, because all CGI is in function of the story, not just to shock you.Also, soundtrack is getting great along with the story.I would recommend it, and I am waiting for second season!Update: don't watch the second season, it just ruins the first one. First one is 10, second is like 3. Not good. Could be completely different series like spin-off, but then I wouldn't watch it.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"First of all, watch it with subtitles because dubbing is terrible and original language is always best. I watched the first episode because I got bored and love these types of shows, then found myself 5 episodes in and really liking it. I would rate the first half of this show a high 8/10 even with some sketchy CGI and over acting. The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it's more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it's not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won't say more. The CGI is sometimes great, then goes totally flat and looks absolutely horrible. Overall, this is a very enjoyable show to watch with a very unique premise behind it. I look forward to season 2 should they make one.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"OK, I am going to start by saying that I'm a huge horror fan so this series really caught my attention. From start to finish it was a Rollercoaster of creepiness, scares, emotions and awesome character development. Never got boring for even a second and the monsters are really cool and deep if you are paying good attention to the story. Most monsters in horror movies don't even make much sense but in this series it does make sense. Because I got pretty tired of horror movies with the classic its just a bunch of meaningless jumpscares and enemies that are just there to fill the plot. No more blubbering. Go watch this series right now and you won't regret it. Excited for season 2 and what is has to offer! (Also I had to give it 9/10, - 1 because of some fight scenes being a little rushed. But still, a series definitely worth watching!)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Starts off well, and falls apart very quickly. The beginning was very well paced and even the CGI was pretty good. Then after a couple promising episodes in the show stops making sense and becomes a string of random plot lines and awkward emotional scenes where characters just stare at each other and cry, most of the time for no reason other than to kill time (this could have been 4 or 5 episodes instead, with fewer characters).
Eventually character development and motivations just fall apart and it becomes a mystery why anything happens or any character does anything.
Also a lot of seemingly important things happen that are never addressed again.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

So what the heck happened? It felt like a completely different show. The style, the pacing, the direction, the acting, everything felt different. There was far too little of the original cast, and none of the new cast were interesting. There was no direction, it was all over the place, I didn't form a bond with any characters or locations. It felt like the show completely lost its heart and soul.The first 3 episodes are nothing but a military brutality fest with no point other than to illustrate people are worse than the Monsters could ever be. I liked it better from ep 5 on, but it was still just a slog and I was glad to be done.I've never been so disappointed with a second season.

Rather than just a straight up infection turning people into monsters, the nature of what is turning people into monsters is left intentionally vague, though it is affected by the type of person. There is a lot of human drama and issues dealing with surviving in an enclosed area with limited resources. The actors/actresses are good for the most part, though there is a disconnect where some characters are super emotive and over the top and others and barely responsive given the situation. The one thing that I thought could have been better were the effects. While I understand that it is a lower-budget show, it's just that a lot of the CG, especially the monsters, felt out of place. Some of the CG looks pretty good, other CG not so much, but it just doesn't really mesh well together. If all the CG was low-budget but had a more consistent art style and direction I think it would have been alot better. Still, a pretty good show.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"I found this series through the manhua based on it and was shocked when I found out that it was produced and created, I didn't expect something like Sweet Home to get a Live Action release when not even an animation of it had been done.And I like it, shockingly enough.Usually Live Action adaptions of works in manga/manhua/comic/book form these days I have a visceral dislike for as they're usually terrible, but this adapts part of the story well.Lets get to the deets tho, the actors are fine, they're usually as believable as possible for what they are playing though some of it comes across as a little hammy to my uncultured Western ears, it might be decent for Korean TV/Movies but I wouldn't know, this is literally the first piece of Live Action Korean cinema I've seen and like I said I like it. (well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn't give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it's a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there's a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it's a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they're zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That's what drew me to the series in the first place and it's a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn't 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they'd let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it's fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don't speak Korean, the VA's in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"As a sweet home fan since literally the start of season 1 i was so disappointed watching season 2, the plot completely went off the rails after episode 3 and so many main characters from season 1 were killed off like they were nothing. First of all the dude from season 1 that turned into a monster on the bus in season 2 that killed the girl, that was honestly the start of the downfall as they gave character to season 1 and were killed off in season 2 like they were nothing. And don't get me started on Ji-su who was unrightfully killed in episode 3, not even to a monster but some rocks, she was one of the best characters too and practically made ""sweet home"" but died like a side character. Also, the plot was basically just filled with new irrelevant characters and overruled by the military. They also gave the MAIN character hyun-soo, who is literally on their poster, less screen time than some of the military men. And the season 2 monsters cannot even compare to the a season 1 monsters, the s2 monsters were shown with practically zombie characteristics whereas in season 1, basically every of the monsters had a storyline as to how they became a monster and what their desire was. Talking about ji-soo again (can you see my frustration) she and the other OG characters who carried the whole of season 1 were killed so fast when they developed so much depth into season 1. And to finish off my rant, the plot was horrible i'm sorry but half of the time i didn't even know what was going on because all that it was, was talking about military and that's about all i got from it, at one point i thought i was watching a war movie. Unless they bring back ji-soo somehow because of the fact that her body was never really shown, i don't see how sweet home season 3 can pull through and impress me like season 1 did.

Do they know how to put up a valid argument? After they had been locked out of their own home, after getting it back, they tell the person who kicked them out and stole their money and company to leave and she simply says, ""you can't make me leave, I'm a resident here,"" but she was able to put them out of their own house without warning? Please. What really irritates me are shows where the villian gets away with literally everything and they are completely unstoppable. And as Hae-in goes in for surgery that will erase her memory, not one person said, ""let's make a bunch of videos so you can remember us and your life when you wake up!"" Noooo, she writes notes in a journal that the bad guy simply burns.There are so many stupid or unrealistic moments thst i can't list them all.

tt27668559,"To get the good parts out of the way first, I must say that the acting was great, especially when it comes to Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won, but not only. They all delivered top notch performances.Besides that, the OSTs were so beautiful, the cinematography was gorgeous, the sets were beautifully built and the costumes were always magnificent, especially when it comes to the female lead.That being said, I now want to talk about the parts that I consider to be not so great: the plot, the story and the villain.Storywise, the first half was well done. We got to know the characters, their personalities and their beliefs, we got to know the situation they're in and what they want to achieve and we got to see the villain and his accomplices' work being done slowly but steadily, which created the anticipation that was needed for the midpoint of the series.Because of the great twist, the 2nd half was promising but it fell short. The characters changed, yes, but those changes weren't enough to overcome the power of the villains. The rich familly got closer and learned how to love each other more, but they remained just as unintelligent as in the first half.More than that, the second half was way too much abut the villains. It felt that the main leads were playing a secondary role in their show. They started to be so passive and just react at the changes the villain was making.Plotwise, the series started losing its charm in the second half as well. The amount of scenes that felt repetitive and the back and forth between the main leads only showed the lack of creativity of the writer.But the thing that annoyed me the most was that some things happened just because. No set-up beforehand, no nothing, they just happened.Let's take Hae-In as an example here, she had one wish up until episode 13 and she wanted to fulfill her wish no matter what, but when she got the opportunity to satisfy it she immediately turned it down. Her perspective and wish changed in a fraction of a second, and the reason for that was something that was not true to her character for the last 13 episodes. It was a decision that just popped up and set up episode 14 to be the biggest back and forth between the main leads in the entire series.Finally, the villain. They tried so hard to make a memorable villain, that people would talk about, that they started to lose the identity of the show. They invested so much screen time in his character that the theme of the series started to lose it's spark.I respect the fact that he had a scope, that drove his actions the entire time, but at the same time I hate that he was built that strong.He was the type of villain that had everything: money, power, connections, everything. He was invincible. He appeared everywhere at every time. He was just too strong to feel real.He had his weak point, yes, but it wasn't something so important since he always recovered in a heartbeat when he was hit by others.This was my point of view and I hope you'd respect it.I would recommend this series mainly because of it's cast, but no other than that.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Beautiful to look and a great start to the series with funny dialogue and tragic scenarios leading up to everyone's present. My anticipation racheted up after the first couple episodes.However, if I had one problem with the story, it was that the leads didn't have nearly enough screentime together not spent fighting evil. I waited patiently episode after episode for quiet scenes spent in comfort with the leads getting reacquainted emotionally but the end of the day, we didn't even get a hug in the final moments of their happily-ever-after.

Anyway, as a fan of Kim Soo Hyun, he never repeats a role. At first, I got bored with his comeback drama, but after watching the first episode, I started to love his role as a husband. I also started to love Kim Ji-won as an actress. I hated her during The Heirs. 😆 I could say that both of them have come so far. Going back to the drama, the story is not the typical love story. It's more about the feelings after marriage. As a married woman who had a failed marriage, you can feel the love between the couple that was hidden because of emotional exhaustion.

There's always some ridiculous drama going on, and just as they're about to figure it out, there's another drama. So, in my opinion, this show is not a show that deserves 8 points, it is a score given just because the main characters and their short romantic scenes are beautiful. Apart from the plot of the series, the locations, clothes etc. Are nice. The show was a scenario as if scriptwriters were forced to continue the series and they had no more topics to write.

Her face has always been very pretty but here she is shown at her most glamorous. Her hair and skin and makeup and wardrobe are perfect.The story was weak. It was an impossible task for the writer to live up to Crash Landing with the scope and grandeur of CLOY. I didn't expect it to be as good given the subject matter but even then this story was disappointingly thin and weak and not well structured. Terminal illness and memory loss are so overdone in the K drama universe. There wasn't enough story and there were repetitive scenes and predictable plot lines. The villains mother and son were not that well written and were one dimensional. Although it is great veteran actress Lee Mi Sook got a big role as the evil mistress. There are greedy mistresses out there and she did a great job. Park Sung Hoon the villain from the Glory is good at acting evil but his love for her seemed so unconvincing. The colonel's wife and rat from CLOY are a watchable and amusing secondary romance. There are some funny parts when he hides his divorce intentions in the beginning and later contrasting the conglomerate family and the village family. Kwak Dong Yeon brings some comic relief. This great cast couldn't save the weak material. The ending felt like a whimper and the shootout was so cliched. In the shoulder like CLOY?As for the locations, it is great they filmed overseas again. But Berlin and Sans Souci aren't the most magical places they could have chosen. Rather grim compared to this writer's previous overseas locales.

tt27668559,"They made a mistake when they changed the direction of this story. It started off being about how a man who married into a superbly wealthy family was fed up with being taken advantage of and mistreated and was about to call it quits when he realizes that he can't (and maybe also deep down doesn't want to). Then, the story should have explored everything that it would have taken for this man and woman to get their marriage back on track and for their families to reconcile and accept each other the way they never had before. That sounds like a unique story with a lot of material.Instead, the story veers into very tired, overwrought territory filled with clichés: secret funds stashed abroad, villains under your roof, the hero that appears at always the right moment, the OTP whose paths intersected in the past when they were children and later again as teens, and more...oh boy! We also lose the actually funny humor of the early episodes to attempts at humor in the later episodes that are just embarrassing.There are also way too many lengthy scenes of people crying. Can someone please explain to me how anyone finds it entertaining to watch someone cry...cry some more...then cry again? I wish creators of K-dramas would get it into their heads that this is not entertaining. Keep the crying scenes short and to a minimum please!On the plus side, the music is very pretty.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

The story in the beginning is a gem, as it progressed it was predictable and frustrating. The one thing which saved this show and made me rate it so high was the acting, an absolute delight. It reminded me of the emotional intensity when I first watched CLOY, which I'm grateful that I could feel it again. I actually sobbed again which is a testament to how good some scenes actually are.Do give it a try, it can be frustrating and stupid at times but surely watching the acting would flutter your heart.

There are some hidden feelings ( which makes the storyline interesting).To be honest, if you are experiencing a slump in kdramas, then this is the drama which will help enjoy to the fullest.

It's your typical heavy romantic drama with over-the-top antagonists. Whatever's going on, it'll also make you realize a lot of things.The finale was a bit underwhelming for me though... I could've been more satisfied to see more happy scenes of hyun-woo and hae-in together.

tt27668559,"Queen of Tears captivates with its stellar cast, who deliver strong performances throughout the show. The series boasts a visually appealing aesthetic, with designed outfits and stylish sets. However, the narrative falters in the later episodes. It leans heavily on familiar k-drama, and the plot feels drawn-out, making it predictable with cliché injured/ coma scenes. I skipped scenes in the last few episodes.While the show aspires to be a tearjerker, it doesn't quite have the same emotional response compared to dramas like ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" or ""Crash Landing on You."" These dramas deliver a more compelling emotional journey, with a perfect blend of humor (CLOY specifically) and heartfelt moments.I believe the hype of the show is more because of the writer and popularity of Kim Soo-Hyun.

It captivates you from the very first episode.What fascinated me in this series is the unpredictability of the characters! Not every character is what they seem at first glance, and you'll be surprised when their true personalities are somewhat revealed.Always in Korean dramas we see the whole series until the couple gets married, we all are happy to see them get married and we think that their story will always go well but this series will prove to you that it is not. In my opinion, the main obstacles start in relationships after marriage and this series shows this very well.And the star of this series for me is Kim Ji Won, I love her from the drama ""Fight for My Way"".

tt27668559,"I love Kim Soo-Hyun he is the reason I fell in love with KDramas. I also like Kim Jin-Won she is a very talented actor(My liberation notes)she was outstanding in that. So I was eagerly waiting on this drama ever since it was announced. The premise of the show was intriguing enough. But it's a Kdrama after all so it was always going to be cliche. So this was nothing original or outstanding in terms of the plot. It was very much predictable to be honest as the show went further.With a strong cast from the leads to the supporting cast the show did deliver with strong performances. You really feel hatred towards the villians,what lets this show down is the lack of screen time of the leads together. The plot had made it sound as if we would really experience a love so deep between the leads. I wanted the moments they share together to be powerful and memorable.So much time was wasted on unnecessary soapy dramatic scenes. The plot focused too much on their enemies. Maybe I was expecting a love story so I got disappointed. Never the less the biggest issue like with many Kdramas is too many episodes. Each episode had a run time of around 120min with finale 145min. So why did it need 16 episodes? I honestly got bored after episode 12. To the point of skipping through episodes 14 &15. And i didn't miss much,filler episodes in Kdramas are so unnecessary. It simply becomes a bore as everything is just repeating and pointless characters getting screen time.But I will give this drama an A plus for a good conclusion. Sadly it should've have ended around episode 12. So this could've been a classic had they spend more time on the main characters love story. It should've been as good as Crash Landing on you and It's okay not to be okay. But it just falls short from those outstanding dramas.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Kim Soohyun and Kim Jiwon are so very talented and they are the best part about the countless sad scenes, because you get to see their acting, which is exceptional. They're really good at portraying full emotions with their eyes and you will find yourself crying with them in every scene.Here's the thing, the writers have tried so hard to give the audience plotwist after plotwist that they kinda loose the actual direction of the drama. It started as a romcom but right now I feel like watching ""Starway to heaven"" all over again (yes, it's that painful) and do not take this as a compliment at all. This show have had me stressed over weeks! It's unbearable to watch the leads go through that much. Almost dying, going to jail, losing their memories, constantly being manipulated??? Like what the hell is going on? The villain keeps winning and even if at the end he dies or whatever, it won't still make up for the amount of damage he has caused to Haein and Hyunwoo for both their personal lives and their relationship.It would not pissed me off this much if this show wasn't labeled as a romcom, and when you see the trailer you expect something so different.

Even though some of the people are over exaggerated stereotypes, the main couple are such good characters, and the development in both them and the others are really worth the watch. I'm hoping for a happy ending, but I'm also prepared for the opposite.

Sure, some of the plot is predictable, but it still had me sobbing and binge-watching till the wee hours of the morning.The cast is phenomenal and their performance carried the story through its weaker points, especially some of the side characters who add some much needed humor and have solid development. It's beautiful to see the whole extended family reconcile and change.BUT: Amnesia is the Worst. Plot. Device. Ever.I hate it. No hospital would allow a vulnerable memory-loss patient's care to be commandeered in that manner. It derailed the whole story. Yoon Eun-seong is such a creepy and manipulative villain.The last few epispdes also fell apart because it became more and more desperately dramatic and ridiculous, particularly with serious injuries being disregarded. The main couple needed more exploration of the past conflict in their marriage and then subsequent reconciliation of those conflicts.

I had been watching patiently week by week, hoping the writing would improve, but it didn't. It mixed up everything: divorce, a mean mother-in-law, cancer, memory loss, etc.-you name it. I thought the writer was being creative in offering something new because people said the writer was a big deal. However, it turns out the writing is just like a story created by a middle-schooler on Wattpad.I know for sure this drama will be successful in terms of viewership since the writer went back to basics by having good-looking casts and glamorous styles. This recipe guarantees ratings. But, it makes the work look cheap.

tt27668559,"The fist half of the series had such a flaw it was hard to care about the main characters. When Hyun-Woo learns Hae-In is terminally ill his reaction is borderline heartless. To avoid Hyun-Woo looking heartless the show should have done more to show how horribly mistreated he was by Hae-In. Even if the show did that Hae-In would need to have been downright mentally or physically abusive for Hyun-Woo to be as passive as he is about her illness early in the show.It's just not believable that if deep down he loved her he wouldn't be immediately crushed and sympathetic unpon learning of her diagnosis. Instead he and his lawyer friend almost joke about it and how he can hold on to try and get her to change her will. Later, Hae-In learns this and is ""mad"" but such horribly callous behavior would be unforgivable.The horrible way Hyun-Woo reacts early makes the transformation in later episodes not believable.Also the way Hae-In reacts to the her own diagnosis is also not believable. She cares more about the trillion dollar club than the fact she has six months to live.These flaws undermine the second half of the show and more emotional moments.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

It shows titillating love lines and scenes and dialogues that make me tear up and those that make me burst into laughter.The lead actress, Kim Ji Won, is outstanding and right on point in portraying the strong-willed female boss and yet fragile character. As usual, the lead actor, Kim Soo Hyun, also shines in his quirky role.This drama writer always reminds us that there are good sides to everyone and that even villains have a purpose. For example, the main villain has been in love with the heroine since childhood and even protected her from a mad dog attacking her at his orphanage (by poisoning the dog-which foreshadows the sinister way he behaves as an adult). Many of his sidekicks are from the same orphanage, which explains why he joined hands with them.Humanism and doing the right thing are also in the background in this drama. The scenes where the rich in-laws take refuge with the poor in-laws is a little boring but provide a setting where they get closer on the personal level without the boundaries of money.I can't wait for the next episodes.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Edit, after watching 16 episodes:
Still a 6 from me. What might have been a beautiful series, was lost in so many other storylines. Wish it had been more about the marriagestruggles and love, and lighthearted and funny moments, and less about the secret money, shareholders, company struggles, the villain mom/son duo etc.Original:
Was looking forward to this show, but for me, it is a huge let down.Have watched 14 episodes, but I am sooo bored. This evenings Ep 14 got me super annoyed, and I turned it off with a few minutes left. The main plot in this episode is enough, we do not need the bad guy there as well. AND, you know how this episode is going to end, because of what the evidence the Korean police find(trying not to spoil anything here).The ML is very stiff(«plastic»-like), and the FL is either hot/cold, but does a good job.The Bad Guy(in the love triangle) is very unlikable, as he should be.I only wrote this review because of ep 14. Before this, I rated the show 8, but it had gone downhill, and is a 6 for me now. The two last episodes must be something very special for me to change my mind.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I don't get the hype. Really. It was just ok at best. Not many likable characters. The Hong family redeemed themselves after they lost everything and began to cherish family more. I thought that was nice. The villain was laughably obsessed over the main girl. His motives lacked consistency. I wasn't convinced if it was really money or Hae-In's love he actually wanted. I thought the leads did a good job acting overall but hated their marriage relationship. The writers could've done a better job at what led to their fall out. You could clearly tell they were so in love before in the flashbacks but acted like it was their first time with everything which was strange. Alot of their issues could be solved if they tried to communicate and they really had little to no skills. But what is a Kdrama without misunderstandings? Kdramas need to do a better job at portraying hospital settings too. It doesn't make sense that anyone can just waltz in to a hospital and claim they're someone's guardian-especially someone who is of high profile. It had some funny and interesting parts here and there but by the end, it just became outrageous with the stuff they were pulling to keep viewers watching. This show is a total makjang as they call it.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Navigating family and ups and downs of life seems somewhat realistic. I've always liked the lead actor and actress in other shows they've done which is why I was drawn to watch Queen of Tears.

And although the show can be slow at times, this builds up nicely the anticipation of what happens next. This is why I can't wait until a new episode is released.

Writer Park Ji Eun once again made another interesting story for us. If you're tired of watching kdramas that bores you even before it get's to the 2nd half, trust me Queen of Tears is different. Every week is a new roller coaster of emotions & twists. But it does not go out of hand it will always bring you back to it's maim message. After 3 years, Kim Soohyun is back and sure he never disappoints with his drama choices, Baek Hyunwoo is just perfect for him, we all know he made his name because of his exemplar acting skills but everytime he's on another role he still surprises me with his acting and delivery, combined with the likes of actress Kim Jiwon who also never fails to capture our hearts with her roles. Queen of Tears will be her era, it's Kim Jiwon's time just like My Love From The Star was Kim Soohyun's era. The dynamics of every character in this drama is important no role is a waste, it's one of the power sof Park Jieuns's writing skills.It's high quality production, from props to locations, script to direction, to screenplay. 1.5hrs of every episode will not feel long because your eyes will be delighted with the qualoty of this production.As someone who has been watching kdramas for almost 20yrs, trust me on this. This drama is interesting, worth the time, and the emotions you'll end up spending every episode.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"If I could only give a higher rating than a five star, then I would. I absolutely loved this k-drama right from the get-go. Words are not enough to describe how beautiful this series is. Everyone did a fantastic job in it. The casting was perfect. One of my favourites aside from the lead couple is Aunt Beomja. She is so transparent and a good judge of character. Hats off to Kim Soo Hyun for a brilliant performance in this drama. I could clearly see why he is the highest paid actor in Korea. He is beyond expectation. He is versatile. He could make you laugh, cry and fall in love with him in an instant. Kim Ji Won suited her role as well and she was perfect for it. As I was watching the first few episodes it gave me the vibe of CLOY including the OST. They were a perfect match in this series. I thought to myself, finally there is another k-drama that could beat CLOY. Among a few friends I know including myself have taken a hiatus from watching k-drama as there isn't really good ones out there anymore until Queen of Tears. I watched this drama not realising it was not complete yet i.e. Missing episodes 15 and 16. Since it was so good, I watched it again from the start while waiting for the last episodes to become available which made me appreciate the series even more as I understood it better compared to the first time where I could not contain my excitement and rushed into watching it. Now, I have completed the series and I am over the moon. It was so beautiful. A story of love, family, reconciliation, friendship, character, sacrifice, perseverance, patience, selflessness, humility and so much more. Your one stop shop to a feel good k-drama. Highly recommended⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Overall love it. Enjoy 😊.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"As someone who has been on dramaland for more than a decade, I can assure y'all that Queen of Tears was THAT drama. No wonder the kdrama was a hit, they gave us EVERYTHING. The plot, the chemistry, the acting, ost, everything was top tier. They truly deserved all the praises and audience.We are so used to watching kdramas that end with ""They lived happily ever after"" that watching QoT and seeing what happens after ""happily ever after"" was amazing and super different. I'm not knetz but I feel like, after so many years, QoT was the drama who made korean people gather together to freak about a kdrama again. And this already tells a lot about the drama.Kim SooHyun and Kim Jiwon (also all the crew) gave us an unforgettable love story with BaekHong couple. I'll thank them forever for accepting their roles on this. Queen of Tears has become one of my favorites kdramas, so yeah, I recommend it. Forget the haters, they're being only bitter and jealous over this masterclass of acting and developing a good love story.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Your typical rom-com filled with many cliches. However, the show is quite addicting and it quickly builds empathy and sympathy. For rom-com fans, I'm sure the show offers everything they want in a show like this. For others, this is more of a guilty pleasure. Satirical depiction of husband/wife roles in traditional Korean society is quite funny and on point. The obliviousness of the super-rich is also hilarious. Again, a strong cast with exceptional acting carries the show forward. However, there is no denying the fact that the show is way, way too long. Each episode is nearly 90 min (x 16 episodes). Because of the sheer length of each episode, you will inevitably have to sit through a lot of filler scenes in each episode. If the show was cut to 75 min per ep for 16 ep or 90 min per ep for 12 or 14 eps, this could have been a much, much better show.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,This drama is the best that happened in 2024. I've never invested in a korean drama for too long until Queen of Tears came. The pairing of Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won is lit. They nailed the character of Baek Hyun Woo and Hong Hae In. Their acting is superb along side with the other cast and the cinematography is just wow. I cried a lot more than I did in other korean drama. I realized communication is very important in every aspect of relationships especially when you are married. Don't let pride take control of your emotions. I really hope Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won will get an award for their performances here. Fighting my yuyu couple!,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I watched the whole series, but it didn't bring anything new or exciting. At first, it seemed promising, especially in how it explored the main character's story. When Vincenzo made a cameo, things got interesting. But then, it went downhill. The show became all about drama, ignoring other important storylines. Some scenes dragged on too long, with lots of unnecessary emotions and twists that didn't matter.The show looked good with its camera work, acting, and music, but it had some big problems. The bad guy was shallow, just after money and power. And the main girl's family was portrayed as kind of dumb, which didn't make sense. The story was too predictable, following a basic pattern with choices that didn't seem real.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Both leads are pretty generic characters too. And them showing ML too much of a hero was putting me off. Sorry for others it's just my personal opinion.

Every one was out to get them. But i suppose that is true for such rich people, every other person is ready to stab you in the back.The parents of ML were amazing. Even the father of FL is really good.I loved the story of FL brother.His love for his wife was so unreal. Who loves like that?. But it was so good to see.But mainly it was the role of Baek Hyun-woo that totally kept me hooked on. What a love.Unbelievable.Each episode had atleast one scene which you want to go back and watch again.All those scenes in Baek Hyun-woo village.... and in the girls family shooting ground as well !The Germany scenes....

Of course there will always be tropes or the usual associated with k dramas but in reality it depends on.how it's executed and here it's executed flawlessly. I have never cried so much watching anything ever. These actors especially the two leads ( The two Kim's ) Kim Ji-won and Kim Soo-hyun were amazing if you pay attention to the micro emotions. I would say only one episode didn't feel in flow with the series that being ep. 14 for me. Overall it was visually amazing, the story was utterly complete and unlike most k dramas it had an entire conclusion in the end. As for the many things that happen to this couple in the drama well rich people get victimized too. Everyone is human. The best k drama I've ever seen.

The bond between soo cheol and da Hye is also very nice cause they care for each other. I really liked our leading couple.When my friend told me that she couldn't stop her tears while watching few scenes, i couldn't believe her. I was like, who will cry watching drama.

If you are an Indian then I would tell you brother that you like all Bollywood movies And start watching Korean movie. In this you get to know the meaning of patience, if any movie of us is made then the foolishness starts in it, which is wrong That's why watch this kind of movie where there is love, care and worry, however much I add it is less.

tt27668559,"Visually stunning spectacle with a promising premise that unfortunately falls flat due to a mediocre and sloppy storyline. While the lead actors' undeniable chemistry manages to salvage some moments, it's not enough to overshadow the glaring shortcomings of the plot.The story feels rushed and disjointed, with gaping plot holes that leave viewers scratching their heads. It's evident that the creators poured a hefty budget into the production, evident in the lavish sets and breathtaking cinematography.What saves Queen of Tears from being a complete disappointment is the lead actors' palpable chemistry. Despite the weak material they're given to work with, they manage to inject life into their characters and deliver believable performances. Particularly, Kim Ji Won shines with her acting prowess, showcasing potential that could lead to promising opportunities in the future.IT may offer some entertainment value as a one-time watch, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impact. The high production value and memorable lead pair might be enough to draw viewers in initially, but the lack of substance ensures that it won't stand the test of time.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

I'm rooting for Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won as a couple outside the drama. Their chemistry on-screen was beyond the roof. If I'm being honest I wouldn't want a part two because it's perfect.

And I find it even more unbelievable that the 3/4 of the cast are against them and they can do absolutely everything. Bribe, lie, do break ins, incitements... Anyhow, twists and spins are predictable, so is the love story between main characters with their ups and downs. There are moments which will make you laugh and moments that will make you cringe.

I do understand you have to suspend logic and soften the viewing lens sometimes- I am OK with that. I won't give away any spoilers but I count at least 20 times where I found myself saying out loud, 'that doesn't make sense', 'his character wouldn't do that...', 'why didn't they do this/that?'. Crash Landing handled these situations well enough to help us move forward. This program didn't and it's a pity. This series could have been a classic.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

tt27668559,"I really enjoyed the series. The main leads had great chemistry and the rest of the cast was excellent too. As always, this is a K-Drama and it seems all the directors goes to the same school for directing and storytelling. They love to reuse the grabbing of the wrist/arm to get the girl's attention. They use 5-10 camera angles saving someone from falling. They have the ""deer in the headlights"" reaction when being kiss or hug. They have drivers that never slow down when someone is standing in the middle of the crosswalk. And the directors love to have someone stop in the middle of the crosswalk to chat. I do want to point out some ""bulging eyes, hands to the head"" WTF moments. I know some of these examples is probably to add suspense and push the narrative forward, but...!? When the main villain has the rifle pointed to Baek and Hong, after the police told him to drop the weapon and he started to raise the rifle, they should have shot him! And even when he shoots them, the police doesn't do anything and actually gave him time to reload his rifle before opening fire?? The worst moment is the chairman not questioning the clause in the contract! If the Hongs has a scandal, all shares and interest goes to the villain?? Only Baek said that the clause should've been taken out. I guess the writer of the show wanted us to believe that the Hongs are idiots and morons. Like I said, the directors must all use the same manual when creating these moments and scenes. Ahhhh, but that's why we love watching K-drama/romcom because of these cheesy and head scratching sequences! Overall, Queen of Tears was a fun and very romantic series. I highly recommend it!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,Amazing leads and such an emotional story. Lots of tears were shed throughout watching this emotional show. Kim Soohyun and Kim Jiwon kept me watching all the way and the supporting cast were also all fantastic. I would say though there are some plot holes were it could have been solved easily (can't really say without giving any spoilers). But this did not stop me enjoying the show at all or take much away. Haven't watched a kDrama like this in a long while and totally deserves to be tvns top rated drama!!

tt27668559,"Literally, I don't know that why some people are saying that the story and the plot is so cringe and it has no story line, but for me it is the best kdrama I've ever watched, like this kdrama made me write a review because I personally don't write reviews but today I had to.So as per the story line, it's too good like I don't have enough words, the storyline gives us a good moral and also it's like that just a few moments ago you have cried and then you are laughing, it's like this. The story takes a big turn! After episode 10, there not might be a kdrama this good. I know it's kinda emotional but some scenes Literally give chills and a good laugh and it's a kdrama or we can say drama in which the main female lead doesn't give attention to the villain, like on indian or any dramas there is that the female lead or the male lead gives attention and gets brain washed because of the villain but in this case nothing happens like this and which is a good thing. The Era from episode 11 to 16 half is the emotional one and the most annoying but also the best. The funniest thing, I have seen the kind cry more than the female lead who was actually dying. But that's okay, that's how love is, now the ending is good too, it contains many emotional or good morals. For me it's the best kdrama in my eyes and opinion, words aren't needed to describe it and how many times I say that it's a very good kdrama, even the best word used describe it is not there in english, no matter how many times I say wheather 100, 100000 or millions or maybe trillions, it won't go up to the level, it is such a beautiful kdrama, it is full of elegance and it is realistic, awfully good..",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

It is easily my favorite drama now, like it topped the list of the 100s I've seen. There are other greats in my top ten, but this is going to be extremely hard to knock from that position for me.The introduction of the characters, their immediate believability, the acting strength of each and every member of the cast, the absolutely gut wrenching emotions displayed, and the beautifully poignant ending makes this a full 10.

tt27668559,"Queen of Tears is a K-drama of two halves. The first, composed of its early episodes, is an innovative take on K-drama romance. The other is a chaotic second half that squanders much of the potential of its beginning. The Netflix hit ended Sunday with a global audience that exceeded the wildly popular Crash Landing on You.In terms of chemistry, the leads were a perfect pair. It's like they were crafted from the cosmic dust of perfect on-screen couples. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for other characters and sub-plots on the show, which are more disconcerting than fascinating.Plotwise, the series started losing its charm in the second half as well. The amount of scenes that felt repetitive and the back and forth between the main leads only showed the lack of creativity of the writer. While the show we ended up with remains compelling, even fun, to the end, the decision to dispense with its profoundly tragic and emotional core makes the endeavor more rote and, at times, even boring. The series never recaptures the rare thrill of its early episodes, but nevertheless had a sweet ending that will surely be a satisfactory element.My Rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

But I always allow for stuff like that, and they do not diminish my enjoyment. I could easily rate this 10 stars, but have reserved that for those I consider pure perfection. I was hooked from the very first episode. All these actors are wonderful, their characters relatable, or at least understandable, and it's beautiful to see the story unfold in their hands.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

The series was quite interesting but there was not too much shock value, not a lot of surprise and the plot looks quite boring if not for the actors i wouldn't have been able to watch such series.

But here, although he still delivers some powerful acting, I felt like somehow he's acting too cute and not so natural anymore like before. The female lead's character is cold and seems a bit tired, that all I can see is a well-rehearsed acting, lacking depth much like the storyline. I am sure she's been great in previous works.This drama may be satisfactory enough for Kdrama fans who love glorified stories of ultrarich, beautiful visuals of Korean actors/actresses and popular cheesy romance, but not outstanding enough in terms of acting and storyline to impart anything profound to the viewers. Well, this is just entertainment and that's it; and maybe, this is just how people like it -- just a safe entertaining respite from reality, even if it's superficial. However, talents and resources could have been better used.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,It gives me a roller coaster ride of emotions. The chemistry of Soo Hyun and Ji Won is superb! The story line will really draw you to feel every episodes. And the starstudded casts really shine in their acting skills they're so good that they are too convincing. There's no episode that I didn't shed a tear. It is so nice that I cannot let it go yet. Huhuhuhu I'll miss my weekend comfort the comfort and rest in my tiring weeks. Thank you for the 8 weeks. Ji won is also very prettyyyyy. BaekHong's visuals are top notch they look so good together. Also the way they enjoy the filming of the show really resonates with the fans. And lastly It open my eyes to value time cause we cannot bring back what is already passed. That we do not know what tomorrow has for us so see and be grateful for each day of our lives.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"The storyline is really great. I shaded tears many times while watching every episodes. The love between the couple enchants me from top to bottom of my heart. I was wondering that if I shall finish this series or not. Because once I finish this, I could not enjoy such a drama in future. But I couldn't preserve this series in my drama-list. Really heart-touching, excellent relationship, romance, feelings, worries, responsibilitis, friendship, formalities and also casualties. This is a great creation in Korean film industry. The most important thing that makes me more happy that this series breaks with an happy ending. If a romantic drama cannot end like this, it really breaks the heart that is unbearable. For this, I love this series most. This couple is one of my favourites.Waiting for S2!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Perfect story that had no mistakes,the storyline had no confusing plot twists and was easy to watch. It had the perfect mixture of comedy,melodrama,romance and you get addicted. I get emotionally attached to most of the kdramas I watch and this kdramas gave me the best ending and made me feel complete after watching it it was so perfectly ended making everyone happy. I've watched 5 kdramas just in 2024 I am very positive this is the best one I hope they get many awards for this masterpiece! The director knew what he/she was doing and the acting was top notch, perfect casting. The show didn't have any unecessary scenes just to make it longer so every scene is enjoyable and because it is a mixture of many genres I think MANY WOULD LOVE IT! THANK YOU TO THE CREW THAT GAVE US THIS AMAZING KDRAMA:)",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,The fact that this has only 8 stars is mind boggling. Probably the best Kdrama ever made and the only thing close is lovley runner. This has everything you could ask for in a Kdrama the 2 main leads are absolutely incredible and the acting alone is 20/10. The story and drama was amazing. And the co-leads absolutely incredible. There isn't one dull morning episode in this show and you could rewatch it honestly and it just gets better and better. The plot twist in each episode is incredible and the writers did such a incredible job on keeping us on our feet each episode. The last episode alone can make you cry 10 times. If you havnt seen QOT please grab a bag of pop corn and be ready to be emotionally destroyed lol.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Talking about the character of the villain Yoon Eun-Seong. It was a very well developed historical construction. A villain who in essence is not created to feel hate but rather pity. Eun-Seong, from the beginning to the end of the drama, dedicated himself to doing the best he could, the best he knew and learned to do. A character who grew up with a strong trauma of abandonment and rejection, always on the margins and forgotten, living in the shadows, praying to be remembered by his mother figure. He spent his life developing a strong identity crisis based on a perfect image to be recognized by his obsession, our beloved protagonist Hong Hae-In and also by his mother. As a bonus, he has to confront his greatest enemy, not the protagonist Baek Hyun-Woo, but himself. And every time Eun-Seong had to face that Hyun-Woo was ahead, he felt even more inferior and lost. In the end, our villain's story itself is a true drama. Result of an accumulation of childhood traumas and distortion of self-image. Yoon Eun-Seong, you should never have felt so inferior, you never lacked anything that was left in your classmate, you just lacked therapy (k).The script of lead couple Hong Hae-in and Baek Hyun-Woo was constructed to be relatable. If for a moment, we put aside the entire ramification of the story and focus only on the couple, we spend the entire drama identifying with one context or another of the moment they lived or are living.Real marriage is not a fairy tale and Queen of Tears made a point of reminding us of that. Daily life can be exhausting, the lack of dialogue starts to bother you, pain is felt differently by people, as is grief. The intensity too; everything for two, will always have two perspectives and we can easily forget that and added to a routine life that we are forced to live, love ends! Hae-in and Hyun-Woo showed us this in an extremely faithful and painful way, how the process can be slow, but extremely easy to stop loving someone and not even realize it. And it is in these moments of extreme exhaustion that something always happens, whether in a drama or in real life.Queen of Tears begins and ends with wedding vows for a reason. It's a drama that begins and ends with love, but shows us in the clearest ways possible, that love alone will never be enough; You always have to fight for what you want. And for that we have the entire plot of the series based on this constant struggle for love to prevail. Fight against your own ego, against your own desires, face your fears, admit your mistakes and face the consequences, accept your flaws, learn to give in, explode with anger, cry bitterly, laugh heartily, scream in despair, cry drunk in the corners, vent with friends, being humble and so many other attitudes that not only Hae-in and Hyun-Woo showed us, but also all the other characters in the series showed us.Finally, I would say that Queen of Tears' ""Mexican soap opera"" is wonderful, but the care for reality and the intensity that Queen of Tears delivered was simply perfect. Honorable mention also goes to the protagonists, Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji-Won. It was only an incredible K-Drama because the cast was incredible.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,One day when only one of us is left.. Was a sure sign that this will end like this. It's a happy ending with a life lived to the fullest with the one you love. I remember one such ending in movie.. where the crawdad sings.It's a great series one of the best ever in kdramas for me. Right from when it hadn't even started. I knew this will end up as one of my favorites along with it's ok to not be OK and crash landing on you.It will win lots of awards..The actor sure knows how to cry. It has become his trademark style but the actress too cried in one of episodes and gave her best performance...,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Now, on to Queen of Tears...although it had some touching scenes, it was boring overall. I had to take severals breaks in order to finish it at all. The only reason I stuck with it is because of the ML (who by way stars in a much more captivating drama titled, ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay'.) He does an amazing job of pulling his audience in with his eyes and facial expressions. He was the saving grace of the drama.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

tt27668559,"From the very first episode of ""Queen of Tears,"" it was evident that this drama boasted a substantial budget, thanks to its cast of A-list actors, including the highly paid Kim Soo Hyun. The early episodes immediately captivated me, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next episode. However, as the series progressed, the storyline became somewhat predictable, which is understandable given its familiar themes. Initially, it presented itself as a pure romantic comedy, but then it introduced a thriller twist-a common element in K-dramas, though I wish they had stuck to purely romantic comedy without venturing into darker themes like murder.The final episodes felt rushed, as there were numerous unresolved plot points from earlier episodes that deserved more attention. Despite these criticisms(?), ""Queen of Tears"" was undoubtedly a successful drama, largely carried by its stellar cast. Without these talented actors, I doubt the show would have achieved such popularity. They truly carried the series to its acclaim.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"All actors are excellent. That's why my wife and I were looking forward to watch this k-drama. However, during the 4th episode we stopped viewing it for various reasons.The basic assumption of this drama, she is going to die within 3 months, is already a matter of taste, but the reaction of the the male lead is absolutely strange. He is full of joy that this way a divorce becomes superfluous. This is the ultimate violation of what marriages are all about. How can someone possibly recover from here?The discussions with his layer friend are weird. They kind of follow the same line of evil reasoning and they happen in public places. For me it is just a question when somebody who is not supposed to hear this will learn about his thoughts this way.Then there is a scene where the makers try to produce tension using a message sent to her cell phone from his relatives about divorce. He has to prevent her from reading it. We felt that we saw this kind of problem already quite often in other dramas or movies. It is just annoying. We used fast-forward to avoid seeing this mess.Btw. His relatives appear stupid when sending this delicate message to her. Their behavior is not understandable. This seems to be a general problem of this drama, that the behavior of the persons involved appears to be unreasonable. This is why we did not feel any emotional relationship with the characters.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I haven't seen anything this good in a while! As someone that's watched kdramas for such a long time, I know how difficult it can be to find a genuinely good drama. This is one of those gems. I can't even decided which was better, the writing or the acting? Probably both. The plot was nothing extraordinary, but the execution was top notch. No amount of reviews can do this drama justice, you should simply watch it for yourself. You will not be disappointed. I see this easily being the best kdrama of the year, and it's not even mid year!

I feel like the cast absolutely delivered everything so well and screen writing was top notch! I loved how each character was given importance and their leisure screen time and story had many turns. I overall loved it so much. PLEASE DONT SKIP THIS ONE OMG. I just loved waiting for a new episode to drop every weekend and the couples chemistry was daebak.

tt27668559,"The plot seems interesting in the beginning, but it kinda lost themselves during 4 to 5 episodes. It gets worse as it reaches 7 episodes. All the plots related to vengeance or coup of the group infiltrate in the family seems unreasonable and unrealistic sometimes. The way that the guy finds the video store is totally out of the blue. One card and he assumes that he has a video that would destroy him.Once the 7 episode shows the divorce issue, everyone forgets everything else and focus only on that.The show had everything to have different twisters and turns, but ended up a story of a vengeance plot that will work out at the 2 last episodes like every kdrama.Kdrama needs to understand that Mexican novelas had their hype as well and it seems that kdrama is getting the same way and soon to be in a level that people are fed up with the same plot.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Queen of Tears wasn't the typical cutesy romantic K-Drama, it was more of a serious, dealing with illness and a little too violent however good enough to keep you drawn in to want to keep coming back for the next episode. The lead couple are both cute - the lead male more-so than the lead female since she came off a little too aloof at times. Deducted the 2 stars for the ending - wasn't my favorite. The best thing I noticed in this drama was the lead male's acting and his ability to show so much emotion - tears in his eyes - you could just see the love in his expressions. Worth watching overall.#QueenOfTears.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"This will one of my favourite drama. It's storyline is so good. At first I thought it's was like typical romcom drama,so I thought I knew what's gonna happen but as I watched more episodes there are many plot twists. Never invested myself so much in a drama, I felt like I've became a part of their family. I cried a lot through the whole k-drama. Never cried this much. Though they tell you it's a romcom drama but you may find it traumatic( like me). Though people say it has happy ending, almost all of us cried until the very last seconds. Cuz it's so realistic. After it QUEEN OF TEARSAnd Kim Soohyun is a great actor. The way he changes his emotions throughout the drama and his facial expressions will make you realise why he's the highest paid actor of korea.Their chemistry was so good that you'll really think they're married irl.

tt27668559,"This series was a bit much.Not only is it 16 episodes, but each one goes for at least 1 hour and a half!! And the script is at least 2 dramas worth of storytelling!!...
That is not to say I did not enjoy it. Luckily, what it does well, it does REALLY well. But you also wonder if it is because of the excessive length, or how it tries to do TOO much, or even how it relentlessly hammers certain feelings and cliches into submission. And at some point, there's too much fluff that gets in the way of what could have been a very effective and efficient core! From deadly diseases, to gigantic corporate power-struggle, even different-class romance, etc.It mostly works because of the leads and some GREAT supporting roles.The male lead is a professional punching bag, but what might be worse, is how perfectly capable he is at dealing with it all. And the female lead is to die for! Then there's the scene composition, editing, production, etc. It's a beautiful show.. so you can tell they used their budget properly (or was rather expensive).I would recommend it IF you can spare the time investment, are fine with overly complicated-and-unrealistic plots that sometimes are resolved quicker than you can see them coming, and accept the fact that they abuse the ""drama playbook"" in its entirety. This has it all, and that might be a fault more than a strength. Thankfully, the ending is so overindulgent that you can let go with a feeling of completion.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

WOWhowever, from then the story is going down hill. It seems the writer for first 2 episodes was paid a lot and then when people got interested, they brought someone else on.The female is supposedly 30 plus years and she acts, whines and does completely silly unreasonable actions towards both male leads as if she is 16 years old... and her 18 years old self is perhaps intellectually deficient or perhaps with IQ of a goose. Most annoying. The writers have no idea of how smart teenager girls are and how well they know how to work (watch Twinkling Watermelon or Pyramid Game please)2. After a jump of 18 years, they still look the same; GET a grip.. he is an idol, maybe he got all sort of treatments, but the girl has been wheel chair bound. No convincing at all.3. She has gone back in past to save her, but she is clueless totally, NO PLAN - NO idea what to do,, just jumping on random occasions and be all over him and when he reciprocates, she runs away without even the curtesy of explaining her.4. Male lead fell in love with what exactly??? More so the 2nd male lead. Baffling. Male lead does not ever demand her to explain her actions and she does not even offer it. What is this?5. Her own memory has gaps the size or antarctica. She has no idea of her past, of her accident, of her abuser... what happened to her memory.The story is getting weirder with every passing episode and more and more annoying... The reason more than 50% of viewership and rating is SIMPLY MALE LEAD... He has CHARISMA. All else is truly below average.And shout out to two actors, excellent performances, the mother of FL and father of ML -- very fine acting, so bad they don't have good dialogues.

You get everything in it, meaning it also shows you when the girl, who is the heroine, has an accident and ends up in the future, how she feels, and when she likes an idea of a guy who is a star and has been in love with her for 10 years, but she doesn't know that we have a relationship together.

Byeon Woo Seok's acting though his character seemed one dimensional, yet he's able to convey emotional depth and his micro-expression was good. On the other hand, Kim Hye Yoon's overacting became too much as the story progressed. I'm not particular impressed with her continued wide-eyed look, and felt she was stiff in intimate scenes. Overall, I liked the OSTs, cinematography and wished the drama could have been shortened to maybe 12 episodes.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,The story starts off quite involving. The first half is quite good. You want to see her save him from suicide and her from paralysis. The appealing cast helps. She is perky without being annoying. He inhabits this star making vehicle perfectly. He is a bit too tall for her. Some of the OST music is nice too.Unfortunately there are too many travels back and forth so everything you watched before feels like a waste of time. It becomes confusing and hard to follow and ridiculous. Cannot keep track of what he or she knows or remembers after a while. The criminal guy going after her feels totally out of place. So many scenes and several trips back in time could have been eliminated.If this series had been 8 or the most 12 episodes it would have been better. The repetitive storyline would have been avoided.

Also she could stop time telling truths from the future, so she could stop the murderer, but she doesn't. Adittionally the explanation of time travel, final resolution and grandma's role could have been better. They insisted too much on unimportant issurs and lost sight of others, as reaction of the boss and acquaintances when they met; additionally ML and FL relation was too calm after they finally find each other happy. I would have expected more passion and impatience after they had waited one after the other for so many years and had been lost so many times; very good chemistry.I gave this an 8, either it should have been a 9, just because I don't think it is better than ""Alchemy of Souls"" and ""Crash Landing on you"".",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

The casting director has done an incredible job at getting the main leads Byeon Wooseok and Kim Hyeyoon. They simply turned into their characters, same goes to the rest of the cast.

Love the plot twist in the second episode. Love the chemistry between main leads. Hope they have a happy ending. I can't wait for more episodes. I am sure everyone will like this kdrama. If u r looking for a drama to watch, you can definitely watch lovely runner. Sunjae crushing on Imsol and Imsol fangirling Sunjae made the drama more interesting.

It's almost 5am, I stayed up binging the final three episodes and have no regrets. Like, I am speechless after just having watched the final episode minutes ago, but the kind of speechless I will remember forever. I laughed, cried, swooned, hid my eyes in fear, and fell in love with every single character in the show. They stuck that final landing like a gold medal gymnast gracefully flipping through the air and landing light as air. I have no notes, no qualms (except if I'm being picky who was knocking on you know who's door on that fateful day, I thought we'd resolve that!). Im Sol and Ryu Sun Jae are my babies forever, love them so much. I'm only sad that it's over. I'm only sad the excitement of watching for the first time is never to return. But I'm also thrilled at the idea that I can rewatch this series as much as I want. Because it's one of my all time faves, Romantic Comedy at its finest, making What's Wrong With Secretary Kim proud. This puts U. S. shows to shame too. Everyone get at Lovely Runners level. Will imdbers agree in time and get the rating back to 9? Or will the ratings here mean nothing as always, I guess time will tell.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

I was wishing him that when will he come back as a lead here here it is .drama must watch if you r fan of love drama it is worth watching it. Hope you guys enjoy cuz I ' m really over the moon by this drama. It's very new kind of love i m gonna watch basically it's a fiction I guess as I seen in episode 1 .

The actors are so top-notch, especially the lead actor who is not just talented but also incredibly charming. And the female lead? She is just adorable! Sure, there are moments when things slow down a bit, but overall, I am totally invested and eagerly waiting for each new episode. There is something about the blend of mystery, great characters, and that time-travel twist that's got me completely captivated. Can't wait to see what happens next!",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"The heroine is a thirty four kpop female fan, upon learning the death of her idol, finds herself traveling back in time and determines to change their tragic fates. Time traveling to your younger self is not a new concept but this movie outshines in corniness and forced romance despite not showing the adequate and logical reasons for their actions at times. In another word, their intimacy and relationships felt rush in order to spoon feed the viewers the artificial 'sweetness' that you'd expected. The acting and the character growth felt short and lack depth. I'm not against these troupes but I was hoping something more mature and fulfillment. The male lead's existing feelings for the female lead makes her stalking and obsession more palatable and unrealistic.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"My SolJae.. What will I do now every Monday and Tuesday? As much as I have loved other dramas, I think this might just be in my top five all time. With the love story that I have been following between these two, and have been watching since basically the beginning, I don't know how quickly I can let them go. These two either brought a smile to my face or tears with each episode.The acting within this project is phenomenal. I felt as if I was genuinely a character in the show with how much emotion and attachment I've grown upon these characters. The chemistry made me feel as if they were actually together. I love both of these actors so much, and I will continue to love them, but Lovely Runner will forever hold a place in my heart.The story follows Im Sol, a girl who's a fangirl of a K-Pop group called Eclipse. She had bought a watch at an auction that once belonged to her favorite member, Ryu Sunjae. Once 2023 begins, that Sunjae passes away, but there's nothing she could do from stopping his death, right? Things began to go into a spiral when she clicks the watch and she goes back 15 years into the past. While there, she meets her favorite member when he was a high schooler. Now she's in her 2008 body and finds that she lived across from him. What will she do now that she is trying to correct time and keep him from his ""unfixable"" fate?I just want to say that this romance is one of a kind. My favorite part about this story is the fact that Sunjae is a loser in love. No matter if he is a singer, an actor, or just a regular highschool boy, he still acts out in front of his crush. He may have lost his memories throughout each lifetime, but he will always find his way back to Sol. It didn't matter what universe or weird time jumps occurred, he always found his way back to the one he loved. His destiny was to be with her, even if he were to have died.This drama deserves all of the hype!! I'm so sad to see them go but I'm also so happy that I got to experience such a wonderful story. This marks an end of a chapter, but there will always be more to come.ALSO!! I loved the fact that even when the future changed, Sunjae was always meant to be some sort of famous person in South Korea. He was a singer whose group sold out tickets, but he was also an actor who had successful dramas. But his occupation didn't matter, he was still Sol's.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

The actors are excellent, the story is perfect in my opinion, I love the concept of the story, based with very funny comedy and a happy ending! Nothing better than that! It's really a big favorite for me. I have never named a film or series as my favorite but this is going to be the first! I simply adore it. More series like this and I would be delighted! Of course not everyone would appreciate this series because it is a bit cliché, but for those who love clichés like me with happy endings, a little suspense, full of humor, a little sadder moments, fantasy and a cute romance you will love! This series has excellent music, I even listen to it in my car, the scenario is well represented, the emotion is very present and the actors are wonderfully chosen! The combination of Byeon Woo-Seok and Kim Hye-Yoon creates a rather unexpected duo in my opinion, but exceptionally well matched! They go so well together.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Most of the Korean drama become boring after a few episodes but it was a exception...the people rating low didn't see the whole drama I guess and saying nonsense and stupid reasons to not like it...you should watch it first. It's much more interesting to me than queen of tears too...I loved it so much ... And again it's my personal opinion... I wasn't planning to watch this drama but while I started I liked it more and more.... Some people are saying that they rated it because of charisma of male lead or it seemed bore to them after first few episodes... While All of the episode are equally good..and female lead too.... They are lovely 😍 Best of luck to them.,positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Honestly there are so many plots by the first episodes which gets the person more excited and can't wait for the next episode, it's so unpredictable and really really exciting but over all I really do recommend it, in the end it's honestly such a nice series.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

however the amazing rating of this series forced me to start it immediately.Ofcourse it was also because of Byeon Woo-seok's beautiful face <3When I started the series this Saturday - 10 episodes had already aired.And before I knew it on Sunday night I was already on Episode 6 !!!It is such a quick watch - once you start you just cannot stop.It has rarely happened with me where I am already in love with the series and planning to watch it again once it is over.Currently I am on episode 10 and trying my best not to watch further until the remaining episode (13 - 16) have aired as I do not want to sit and wait for the finale.I am really hoping it has a happy ending.And not just any happy ending - a detailed beautiful complete happy ending !Not something rushed and incomplete....So as of now - at episode 10 - its a 10 star rating for me.I hope i dont have to come and change it later on :)I tried not to give any spoilers at all in my review.

Honestly, I didn't want to watch the rest of the series. I didn't get hooked right away, but wanted to give it a fair chance.Later when I saw the guy's perspective, the storyline made more sense and I found it more enjoyable to watch. The girl is a great actress, but my goodness her character is such a crybaby! It's exhausting to watch her cry over small things and tears became meaningless overtime that I couldn't get emotional.Overall, this is a true ""rom-com"" and ""fantasy"". Although, I didn't shed a tear on lovely runner, it's still a unique show to watch. For me, this didn't live up to the hype. One thing I'm sure is that I won't be rewatching it.

I honestly, watched the first episode after it's released without thinking about the consequence and pain having to wait for a new episode each week but we're here! Lol Never ever crossed my mind that they would give us THIS much chemistry and let alone be obsessed with SolJae couple. Seriously, this pairing is so GOOD and so cute.Kim Hye Yoon deserves to be casted as she truly portrayed Im Sol. She shined so much here. Her versatility and her showing so many emotions all at once is remarkable.Byeon Woo Seok, delivers Ryu Sun Jae's character as well. His dynamics and expressions are on point. I'm literally in awe of how talented he is?! Like, his vocals??? He could do KPOP/Band vocalist full time! So happy for him he's getting the popularity he deserves now. (Don't sleep on him! He might be the next rom-com king!)This is exactly the rom-com I needed. I honestly love this so much as I have been looking for dramas that are light and not stressful. This is what I'm hoping for!

Lovely Runner turned out to have an interesting plot filled with so much comical relief. It really delivered in ways other KDramas haven't been able to this year.The cast was simply fantastic! Woo Seok and Huy Yoon really captive the audience in their roles as Im Sol and Ruy Sun Jae. Both talended with such an incredible future awaiting for them to be conqured over and over. All the cast was superb, but our leads were living in their own world and we as spectators enjoyed every single minute.No sponsors? No big stream service? Three years to find Sun Jae? No worries at all! All of the hardships and struggles only make this drama more memorable. You have to find yourself asking what the experts in this field didn't see that everyone else did so quickly! Hyu Yoon and Woo Seok saw what the others didn't. This project was meant for them. Only them and the rest of the cast could make it so memorable and relatable.As fate defied destiny in the series, Lovely Runner did the same in real life since its beginnings. I can't stop recommending this beautiful, fun, and intense love story.Hyu Yoon and Woo Seok as Im Sol and RyuSun Jae are a couple to live by. I don't know what the future holds for them personally just yet but their performances in Lovely Runner are nothing but legendary.Well done!!!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

This drama is for the people who enjoy stories about two people who will keep choosing each other time and time again. I think the plot and storyline were written well, the pacing was good and I liked how the characters developed or changed whenever Im Sol changed the past.I especially liked the gradual friendship that was forged between RSJ and Kim Taesung. Speaking of their friendship, I was so relieved when the writers decided to NOT go with the love triangle trope. Instead they focused on writing 2 guys who were major simps for Im Sol, which turned out for the best. There were a lot of other things I liked about the drama, such as how RSJ got closer to his band mate and friend Baek Inhyuk, which was a contrast from their ""first lives""; the chemistry between the lead actors; the soundtrack; the humour sprinkled in the story to keep the overall tone lighthearted; the angst.I was also impressed by the actress who plays Im Sol. She was amazing and totally embodied Im Sol. I hope she'll be getting more main lead roles in the future because she's a true talent.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Comfort green flag characters (even when sonjae was jealous HE WAS JUST SO CUTE it wasn't a bad red flag move)
Hilarious scenes
Absolutely adorable romantic scenes
Beautiful cinematography and ost (and literally every song in the show was a masterpiece)
Outstanding acting from literally everyone
Some adventure and fantasy (and because of that we got so many protective cute moments, they were protecting each other all the time I wanted to scream)
Nice little plot twists and attention to the details,
A clever script
An ending with no loopholes, just comfort and happiness. And something really important? NO boring episodes! I finished this in 2 days, while in most kdramas I take (at the very very least) a week (or even months tbh).All the unrealistic and cliche moments were because it's based on a webtoon like come on if they got rid of some unnecessary trippings etc you would be like ""but you erased scenes from the webtoon you ruined it"" WELL here they are!!!!!!!Overall 10000/10

Honestly I only wanted to watch the drama because of the male lead I don't usually understand time travel stories. But this one got me on my knees . The pure feelings of love expressed by the leads is so heart warming and makes one want to experience such raw feelings of love which is unconditional.

However, I'm not a fan of him but a fan of time travel drama as long as it integrates many elements like Someday or One Day, Reset, Rebooting..The opening starts off quite well. When it comes to episode 3, it turns out to be the heavily repetition of the content, same romance setting, same jokes, same murder chasing scene as well as same crying scene!! I am question myself if I am missing something and watching the same high rating drama. Then I decided to turn on the YouTube spoiler version and found nothing is missing. There is no brain-burning reversals and other suspenseful pursuit of the murderer. Last episode is all about pure love and like family reunion drama genre.

From the first episode you are taken on a rollercoaster of emotions and you don't get off until the credits lights go out in the final episode. What a wonderful series. It makes you laugh out loud, move you to tears, surprise you in an impressive way chapter by chapter, fall in love with all the characters and, especially, with its two protagonists, who were born to make this series. Byeon Woo-seok is spectacular as the adorable Sun Jae, making it impossible to think of another actor to play this role. He represents it so naturally and with such sweetness that it hurts the smile that appears on your face every time he enters the scene. Kim Hye-yoon, gives life to Im Sol and makes you love her from the moment you see her, get into her story and experience each of her emotions. Special mention for Song Geon-hee, who plays Tae Sung, the second lead who, far from being a problem in the story, is a common and relevant thread for both romance, drama, comedy and bromance. . Adorable. If you add to that a beautiful photograph and a perfect OST, you have a 10 out of 10. Really, next to the best I have seen in its genre.

Both songs has been added to my Kdrama playlist so I can listen to them all day.The ending of this drama showed that all sacrifices and challenges overcame were not in vain, it was all worth it in the end.

Acting is not an easy profession , and actors often put in long hours and intense dedication to perfect their craft acting skills, their ability to convey emotions, their range, their character development, or their on-screen presence. Heads off to your efforts all the cast and bts teamThis drama is surely mesmerizing starting from the 1st episode till the last they fired the whole drama..as i watch this ongoing,the wait for each and every ep. Was worth it!! They always left me speechless because of the beautiful scripting the writer did, their acting skills, those twist n turns each ep brings and the behind the scenes too..the excitement and different thoughts of what's gonna happen in next episode is insane..I guess because i get so attached to the characters, it's just heartbreaking to realize that this was the last ep. It was like watching them grow up, followed their journey of life and saw everything they went through, cried with them, laughed with them, and then boom.The TV show ended. You're never going to see them ever again. And that's just weird, because it almost feels like you raised them. Like they're your best friends. At least, that's how I feel. That's why I always need a few days to recover from the heart break of my favorite tv show coming to an end. ;(Atlast i would say that THIS IS A MUST WATCH KDRAMA, NOW GO GRAB YOUR POPCORNS AND EXPERIENCE THOSE BEAUTIFUL EPISODES OF LOVELY RUNNER.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Their chemistry is insane, and I can't help but to fall in love with them in every scenes. Lastly, if you want a korean drama that is unique and can pass as your happy pill or comfort drama.

Truth to be told, I have no idea how to write the review in a way that will point out all the issues I had. The drama is honestly mediocre. And it's not like the plot was well developed. The crime/mystery part is laughably bad with ridiculous conclusions. Something about ""fix me"" stories as it relates to people with disabilities just doesn't sit right with me. Sadly Runner is more like it.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

I personally don't like teenage romance, but Lovely Runner is different, it just made me aware of all the levels of love in 16 episodes. It taught me that whatever chance you get in life to change your fate do it and enjoy every freaking change your 1 inch step made for you.This drama also has the perfect balance of comedy with romance, nothing is going over the board...just that taxi driver is so annoying to me, his side of story should also be explained to calm my nerves a bit.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

But oh my goodness what's with this drama LOVELY RUNNER?Cast: Each and every character is living upto their role. Yeah Sunjae and imsol is the ML and FL. But with their acting, they even bring the side characters to the spotlight. No overdose of cringe or cloche moments. Like ep 10 was so freaking sad and then in ep 11 I laughed like a damn dolphin. Also the romance, the thriller, the cliffhanger, the wholesomeness, friendship, family everything is so damn good.This year 2024 is definitely going to be Kim Hye yoon and Byeon Woo seok year. But for me its definitely the end of kdrama year lmao.

tt31324295,"This show is so fun to watch. It is advertised as a Rom-Com, but it really is so much more. The chemistry between the two leads is very moving so you laugh at the comic scenes and get nervous when there are dramatic scenes. I have watched more than half the total episodes and I can't wait for more....just what the writers wanted. At the heart of the show is what would you do if you could go back in time and change your future. But no time change is without consequences. That's where the drama and comedic scenes really come alive. If you are emotionally exhausted from Queen of Tears, watch this show to recharge your love of K-Dramas. You will absolutely adore Lovely Runner.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"I should've learned my lesson when I was disappointed in Queen of Tears after all the hype and positive reviews it got. I thought this was different because it got way more hype than QOT, also fans said this drama has the vibe of 2016 dramas. I said to myself ""OK let's give it a try, maybe this one is worth the hype, maybe it's different"" NOpe! It is NOT. It's even worse than QOT. Thus, I concluded, ""The more hype a show gets, the more likely it is to be dull.""The synopsis was captivating. I was looking forward to the whole story and thought it would be something amazing and unique. But, man, how quickly that illusion dies. As soon as episode 3, there is one word that resonates just about right: abysmal.Such an amateurish, tacky, and unintelligent string of cheesy cliches that goes on and on and on... sheer smother. All the cliches you could possibly think of are present here. The deep past connection, the multiple ridiculous coincidences, the overly stupid misunderstandings, the umbrella scene (Gosh this particular one was used to no end), the cringy drunken scenes where they confess their feelings and do not remember what they did the next day, the ML rescuing the FL and getting her out of a situation she put herself in out of her pure idiocy, the rain falling whenever the writer feels like it, the ""I hate this person so much"" to ""omo! Why my heartbeats speed whenever I see him"", the fighting over an object then accidentally falling gracefully to the floor with bodies pressed against each other and then a staring contest begins, deciding not to leave and running back in the last minute at the airport...
I always wondered why writers still make the same outdated idiotic cliches, well I have finally found my answer: people still fall for it. Every time! Especially if the actors are attractive, they'll freaking go insane about it, as if it's something they've never seen before.The ML is ok-ish. He has potential, especially in comedy and action, romance not so much. I cringed every time he acted all lovey-dovey around the FL, so I skipped all those scenes. His character is shallow and one-dimensional, sometimes he's like a dead fish going with the flow. The suicide part is undeveloped. We see him depressed for 2-3 minutes then *splash* he's dead. We're told he did it out of depression, but we were never truly shown the reasons behind his *dePrEssion*. It made his suicide silly and pointless; it reminded me of the time Michael Scott from the office was on the roof faking a suicide attempt because of depression too. Only there wasn't Dwight Shrute to tell him from the bottom: ""dePrEssion isn't that just a fancy word for feeling *bummed out*?""The FL actress and character are pure torture to the eye. Her overacting was painfully unbearable, and her voice grated on every nerve I had. This is the third drama I watched of her, and oh dear God! In all those three she is the SAME person. Same annoying expressions and cringy behaviors. It was so uncomfortable that I would hide the screen with my hand and read the subtitles. All the FLs of Rom-Coms tend to be dumb and clumsy but her character is on a whole other level. The number of times she acts surprised with eyes wide open saying oh! Is endless, to the point where it became her signature look for me. The main reason that made her cling to life again and become a die-hard fan of Sun-Jae is simply laughable. Are we supposed to believe that when you're at the lowest point of your life, depressed and on the verge of killing yourself, a stranger on the radio saying to you ""Live another day"" would restore your will to live? Seriously, the way the writer handles psychological disorders is absolute nonsense.Both reasons for her becoming an obsessed fan and him committing suicide are poorly written and underdeveloped. It's really frustrating because the story was built on these two major elements that were totally ignored after episode one. So, the first episode was useless, they could've just shown us a slide of the synopsis and we'd still be able to follow the rest of the story, which turns out to be nothing but a salad of irrational, illogical, and completely meaningless decisions, reactions and twists in a vain attempt to patch up all the holes of an already stupid enough scenario and bring it to an end.I watched it on higher speed up to ep 10 so I really tried, until I thought ""Why am I doing this to myself?"". So, I took a break from watching for several days to recover from the writer's terrorist attack on my brain. After that, I was skipping past everything just to reach the end.If I were a teen, then yes, maybe I would've liked it. But I fail to understand, for the life of me, how would a mature rational human being rate this brain-melting idiocy a 10/10?If you value your brain, skip this pile of amateurish cliches.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

I am so happy that I finally watch this after ignoring this from my recommendation for so long and to every person who haven't watch this yet, you are missing out a lot. Lovely Runner may not be on Netflix and does not have the highest rating but you can clearly see it's popularity and how well received it is by the fans like me.

Acting/Cast 10.0
Music 10.0
Rewatch Value 10.0
One of the best KdramaOh where do I start? I've been seeing this show in my recommendation since this show started. I really wanted to watch this since Kim Hye Yoon is the female lead I liked her from Extraordinary You and I was really hooked with that drama. I was expecting that Lovely Runner will give me the same feeling but I hold back because this is on-going I didn't want to experience the agony of waiting. But then yesterday I can't help but binge watch and finish all fourteen episodes. All I can say is that Lovely Runner is perfection. It gave me nostalgic feeling. The OST is so good it keeps playing in my head over and over. The cast is perfect. They are all versatile. This show gave me a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Kim Hye Yoon never disappoints she act so well that you can't feel she's acting at all. It was so natural. She can make me laugh then cry after a moment. Byeon Woo Seok also matches the female lead's versatility. I really love his character in this drama. He portrayed his role so well. I am thankful that the actors who were supposed to play Ryu Seon Jae turned down the role because Byeon Woo Seok is destined for this role he nailed it and I can't imagine any guy playing the male lead aside from him. He looked like a real swimmer, actor and an idol. I just found out that he actually sang the song 'Sonagi (Sudden Shower)' like damn he's so talented what else can't he do? The concert part where he sang Sonagi is full of emotions the last time I got carried away with a song like this was Jung Yong Hwa's 'Because I missed you' in Heartstrings and to think he also sang it live?! How I wish there will be a real concert for Eclipse. They even have their own YT channel with all the OST of Eclipse. Byeon Woo Seok is a gem. His character is the greenest flag male lead I've ever seen in a drama. I hope they work again together in the future. The only thing I'm sad about is that this show has to end and I'm gonna miss my happy pill. Kudos to everyone who made this show a success. 💕",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"I thought kdrama already forgot their romantic drama's hype. Yeah from 19 -24 few good story came. And this one is one of them. Undoubtedly this will be the best romantic kdrama of 24. The story was so good with a good ending.From the first episode this drama was not boring at all. Yeah there was too much climax in the story until 15 episode. But trust me without climax and thriller you will get bored. So in my opinion this story was top notch.Now talking about their acting, I know that female lead. She already did a same kind of drama may be (Extraordinary you). And she nailed it in both drama. Her nervous and sad face will kill you. So undoubtedly she is best for that kind of story. And about male lead, I never watched his drama. Even though his acting was not super cool for romantic drama, still he did his best. And their chemistry was super good.Actually all credit goes to this drama's story writer. He wrote a really good story.

There's no real reason why the FL Is able to go back in time. Also, the reason for the. ML's Suicide is not explained. He doesn't look depressed or unable to go on with Life in the first episode for him to suddenly leap off the balcony. If they knew each other from high school, why did he act as if he didn't really know who she was when she was in the wheelchair? The really high ratings are not really supported.

Honestly speaking, the plot would've gotten annoying if Kim Hye-yoon, Byeon Woo-seok, Lee Seung-hyub, and Song Geon-hee weren't able to pull it off. The chemistry between the whole cast is the success of this show. Of course, Kim Hye-yoon and Byeon Woo-seok deserve special mention as leads. They were 100% the right casting choices for the way the characters were written. If actors of lesser competency and chemistry had been chosen, I would've finished the show begrudgingly rather than enthusiastically.While I think the plot could've been different and just as entertaining, the writers and director still did an amazing job at creating such a fun and healing story.I would love to say I'm gonna find my own Ryu Sun-jae now, but I don't think a man like him exists.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Although they tried to muck it up with cliche scenes (flashbacks, slow catches, so-so side murderer plot), they couldn't make you Lovely Runner.What I think they got right:
-Choosing the PERFECT cast! Byeon Woo-Seok is the most IN LOVE man I've seen a in while!-We got an awesome setup episode that really opened up the world we were joining.-We got introduced to the mystery aspect pretty early on so it wasn't just thrown in there hastily
-A original story with a non original theme (time travel)
-No awkward skinship
-very nice ost
-comedy (I had hoped they'd continue to poke fun at clichés like when the friend was dropping petals from the roof, but see below)What I would mildly critique them on
-Hye-Yoon really got to show some acting skills but I think the writers did too much having Sol CRY in 75% of her scenes.-They quickly abandoned the cute ending scene where we see something change in the future at the end of the episode (the photo appearing on the table)
-With such good writing for the main characters, it was disappointing to see the same ""older brother / sister's best friend"" relationship play out the same as countless other dramas.-As mentioned, they really went out of their way to include those overused elements that all k-romances use.... I can forgive the 8 umbrella scenes because at least the rain was built as plot device.It seems like I have more negatives but that's just not true. This was really a good drama if you're looking for some romance. You will feel the swoon all over because the leads were very believable as in love.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

tt31324295,"Lovely Runner has captured my heart, and how! I can't get enough of it-I'm already watching it for the third time!What sets this drama apart is likely a combination of:* An unbelievably perfect cast!The cast is simply stellar! Kim Hye Yoon's portrayal of Im Sol is impeccable, especially in the comedic scenes. Her performance in the drunk and post-breakup scenes with Kim Tae Sang had me laughing out loud. Yet, she seamlessly transitions to handle serious moments with equal skill.Byeon Woo-seok brings Sun Jae to life in a way that's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. His portrayal convinces viewers of his love for Im Sol, evident in the way his eyes light up whenever she's present.* Excellent plotThe story goes beyond just time traveling and romance, delivering some profound messages. In one episode, Im Sol reflects on how we often miss important things while focusing on something else. That really resonated with me. Additionally, the idea that while some actions can change the future, others are destined to happen was beautifully woven into the series.The plot is tight with little to no loopholes. Any questions I had during my first viewing were answered in subsequent viewings. I encourage critics to watch the drama a second time if they have any issues with the plot. There are a few minor plot holes, but none are significant enough to detract from the drama.* Beautiful narrationI loved how the story was narrated from both Im Sol and Sun Jae's perspectives. I also appreciated seeing the second part of a scene first, followed by the events leading up to it. This is common in many dramas, but this show executed it with such finesse that it was easy to follow and provided those ""aha"" moments* Terrific supporting cast & side storiesMy favorites are Kim Tae Sang, Sol's mom, and Sun Jae's dad. They are amazing performers who added another dimension to the story, making it feel so real. I particularly enjoyed Tae Sang and Sol's interactions in her ""noona"" avatar. They were hilarious yet endearing. Sun Jae and Tae Sung's bromance and rivalry were equally delightful.What I didn't care much for was the side story about Sol's brother and her best friend. I fast-forwarded through most of their scenes. Also, in the last episode, I felt it was out of character for Sol to prioritize her aspirations over Sun Jae. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, but it didn't seem true to Sol's character. She and Sun Jae had waited their entire lives to be together, yet ""making a movie"" was more important to her than being with the love she thought she had lost. This didn't sit well with me.However, I'm willing to overlook this, given what an amazing experience watching the whole series has been!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Finally, a K-drama that truly gives me those lovey-dovey feelings! Sun Jae is absolutely adorable, and both actors deliver incredible performances that bring the story to life. Their chemistry is undeniable, making every scene feel genuine and heartfelt. The storyline is compelling and keeps you hooked from start to finish, filled with moments that make you laugh, cry, and cheer for the characters. The plot balances humor and romance perfectly, making it a delight to watch.What sets this K-drama apart for me is how relatable and down-to-earth the characters are. Sun Jae's charm is simply irresistible-his cute mannerisms and heartfelt expressions make you root for him throughout the series. His voice is another highlight, adding a layer of emotion and sincerity to his character that makes him unforgettable. The way he interacts with his love interest is natural and endearing, creating a romantic atmosphere that feels both refreshing and authentic.The OSTs are another standout element of this series. Each song is beautifully crafted, perfectly matching the mood of the scenes and enhancing the overall emotional impact. The music elevates the storytelling, making those romantic moments even more touching and memorable. It's rare to find a soundtrack that complements a drama so well, but this one nails it.This K-drama has quickly become my favorite, and I can't recommend it enough to fans of lighthearted, romantic series. It's the perfect escape from reality, offering a feel-good experience that leaves you with a warm heart. The writing is sharp, the direction is spot-on, and the pacing keeps you engaged throughout.If you're looking for a K-drama that will make you smile, laugh, and fall in love with the characters, this is the one to watch. It's the best I've seen in a long time, and Sun Jae's cuteness is just the cherry on top. His performance, along with the rest of the cast, makes this series a must-watch.

Lovely Runner"" is a K-drama that excels in every aspect, from its unique storytelling and strong performances to its high production values and deep thematic content. It's a series that will leave you thinking long after the final episode. If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend giving it a try. It's a journey through time and emotions that you won't want to miss.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"What an amazing drama. I seriously believe that no other drama will ever top Lovely Runner. It's the way it had me enthralled by the time I finished the first episode. Imagine being able to go back and save someone who has saved you, by being your favorite idol/person... I would do it too, but that episode 2 plot twist at the end was really set the standard and we all knew how good the drama was going to be. The way it ties Im Sol & Ryu Sun-Jae's story in a much deeper level. Just wow! Also, gotta give it to my girl Kim Hye-yoon. SHE CARRIED THE DRAMA. Her acting is out of this world. I cried when she cried. I laughed when she laughed. Every one of her emotions were felt through the tv. Byeon Woo-seok, our handsome Sun-Jae, I mea, what a gorgeous man, and he acts and sings. What?!?! His and Hye-yoon's chemistry was a 10/10. It felt so real I just loved them. The casting was top tier. As for the rest of the cast, I loved and the story just felt so natural even with all the time travel and timelines over lapping, I loved it. And to finish my little review, Mr Taxi driver, why were you beefing with a couple of 20 year olds. Hahah. Please give LR a watch if you haven't. You will love it.

tt31324295,"I'm still reeling from the aftermath of watching Lovely Runner, a KDrama that has left an indelible mark on my heart. Kim Hye Yoon shines as Im Sol, and Byeon Woo Seok perfectly complements her as Sonjae. Their chemistry is palpable, making their love story utterly convincing and captivating.The casting is exemplary, and the acting is sublime. Kim Hye Yoon's talent is undeniable, and her ability to elevate her co-stars is a testament to her exceptional skill. Her male leads always seem to soar to new heights after sharing the screen with her!Every moment of Lovely Runner is a treasure, and the writing is superb. The ending is particularly noteworthy - I won't spoil it, but it's perfection. I'm desperate to erase my memory of this drama just so I can experience it all over again!Thanks to the incredible actors, I'm now hooked on Byeon Woo Seok and Kim Hye Yoon, eagerly seeking out their other projects. Lovely Runner is a must-watch KDrama that will resonate with anyone who's ever believed in love. Don't miss out on this beautiful story!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Deciding to watch this drama on-going was the right decision. I started this drama because of THE Kim Hyeyoon and time travel is one of my favorite genres. The first ten minutes of the pilot episode managed to take me into a deep emotion when Im Sol lost her willing for life and then she got a glimmer of hope from Ryu Sunjae and it became the turn point of her life. Im Sol's life as a fangirl also makes me feel very familiar and relatable. The development of the story then made me feel like I was riding a roller coaster of emotions and the experience of watching this was like taking a trip to somewhere for the first time and I couldn't guess what they would give me next.Time travel back to school plot and first love stories are nothing new in East Asian dramas and I have watched quite a lot of similar stories before. However, this drama is able to give me all new feelings that I have never felt before from the same genre. This drama succeeds in presenting elements of comedy and also romance very well. The romance was conveyed so beautifully and it succeeded in making my heart flutters so many times, while the comedy succeeded in making me laugh out loud. Other elements, such as angst and the mixture of various existing tropes, are also mixed well which makes this drama so rich with flavors.The two main leads have very strong chemistry and each complements the other. Kim Hyeyoon is an actress with wide-range acting skill. She previously proved her ability in several roles. Here, she plays a quite complex role. From just one drama, she is able to convey various emotions in an extraordinary way. Kim Hyeyoon's strength in my opinion is that she can make her co-stars follow the same rhythm as her. Even though Byeon Wooseok is an actor who has previously shown his abilities in several roles, but perhaps this is his best role so far, especially in the romance genre. I also need to praise the director, because of his excellent works he's able to present Byeon Wooseok's microexpression so well. To play the main role in the romance genre, good synergy between the two main leads is very necessary. Kim Hyeyoon and Byeon Wooseok are a very matched couple that this drama successfully presents to the audience, so that we can feel what a romantic comedy should convey through the screen.Cannot be avoided, in the time travel genre it is difficult to avoid plot holes, especially if the episode length is limited. Actually, I hope there are several things that are explained more in this drama, but I don't think this is crucial because this genre is fantasy romcom, not a sci-fi. For me, that is not a weakness of this drama, because the main message this drama wants to convey is already delivered.When watching this drama on-going, I was very excited and also worried about the development of the plot, but thankfully until the latest episodes I was still able to really enjoy it, as I enjoyed it at the beginning. I am currently so grateful because I have found a good romcom drama again after a long time, but this also has a negative effect on me because after this it will be difficult to enjoy a similar genre for quite some time. Up until now, I have rewatched it for so many times, because rewatching this after the story develops further gives a stronger feeling.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,This is one of the best dramas korean industry has made in ages.... It brought back my love for kdramas. Not even a single boring episode the cast chemistry is so amazing that we could actually feel every emotion they are going through.... i know the story is very illogical with the time travel thing and all but still its been directed and executed so so well that it keeps you hooked until the very end. Its also so unpredictable that you can't imagine what going to happen the next week.... I've never been this obsessed with a kdrama couple before... Also I've never waited for mondays ever like this.... i am not sure about how am i ever going to recover from this era of imsol and seonjae... its undoubtedly one of the best dramas of past few year.,positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Yes, this is the best kdrama you will ever watch.I don't even know where to begin because this show has literally EVERYTHING! You want romance? They got it. Comedy? They got it. Drama? You best believe they got it. Fantasy, Mystery, and Thriller? Of course!I'm writing this week before the show ends, hoping I can take my time to review everything I love about this show and why I think the show is a must-watch! The first thing that I should mention is that there is a familiarity when it comes to Lovely Runner from your favorite kdramas, such as Twinkling Watermelon, Strong Woman Do Bong Song, 20th Century Girl, Twenty-Five Twenty-One, and My Lovely Stranger. Yet, besides all of that, this show is very different. It's nothing like the shows I mentioned. I don't want to give much away since this is a spoiler-free review, but it's safe to say there's a lot of familiarity with the show, BUT there is also a lot of originality. The Twist and Turns... When I say this show is unpredictable, I genuinely mean it. When I tell you I did not expect a reveal so soon at the end of the 2nd episode, I knew that this show would continue blowing my expectations; I was not wrong. Every week, this show continued to surprise us in the best way possible. For a Romantic Comedy with Fantasy and thriller, the show thrives in everything! I have watched many dramas, and what feels like forever, it truly feels like you're watching true love. What Imsol and Sunjae have feels and looks natural. When I watch each episode, I feel like I'm watching these two people fall in love repeatedly. It makes me all giddy inside as the two try desperately to hold on to each other.Speaking of Imsol and Sunjae, let's speak about the beautiful actors who portray them. Kim Hye-Yoon, THE WOMAN YOU ARE! I've actually been following this show since it was announced because of Hye-Yoon. I'm a big fan of her and happy to see her get the recognition she deserves since I believe she is one of the best actors I have ever seen (watch her in Sky Castle; there's no better example). Hye-Yoon always gives it her all and works endlessly to provide us with the best results. I mean, the fact I could tell which Imsol she was playing, I think, says it all. This girl has RANGE. Hye-Yoon plays Imsol with so much love, as someone once commented, ""The person who loved Seonjae more than anyone else and understood Imsol more than anyone else was Kim Hye-yoon."" Not to mention, this show would not have existed without her. She is the reason why we have this fantastic show to watch. For apparent reasons, I think a lot of the spotlight is more on Byeon Woo-Seok. Still, I hope Hye-Yoon doesn't get forgotten when this is all done and shines as much as him because she deserves it.Now Woo-Seok, I've been a fan of him since 20th Century Girl. I'd seen his work before the movie, and he always stood out to me with his acting; maybe his height helped a little, too. I genuinely appreciate Wook-Seok for bringing to life a character that feels fresh and exciting to watch. When I say, his portrayal of Sunjae being the GREENEST FLAG THERE IS, I'm not kidding. He indeed wears his heart on his sleeves, and with his facile expression, he is easy to read. Something to mention is that these two actors have to play teenagers, young adults, and adults, which is already impressive. The two perfectly play the awkward years and the maturing times. The two both play their character with love and innocence with a little of a rough side.As I currently listen to the music on repeat, yes, on repeat, because the soundtrack is that good. It evokes emotions that remind me of everything I love about this show. The young love that lasts through the years, the heartbreak, the joy, and the anticipation. It's hard to put everything I feel through words as I try to write, but I want to mention that I love every song dearly, and they share a core memory. A memory I hope to not forget.So, in conclusion... yes, I highly recommend this show!!! Now go watch!!!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"This show was very beautifully written and not at all what I expected (in a good way!) The concept was different and really kept me on the edge of my seat. I truly enjoyed watching. The actors/actresses were perfect in all of their roles and the chemistry between all of them was also perfect. I feel like the writers actually took their time to craft a beautiful story all the way to the very end. I truly appreciate that, especially since so many shows end up having rushed endings. I'm glad this one was not rushed. The music was beautiful too. Now, this is definitely one of my top favorite shows. It outshines the other popular shows that have come out this year.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"I want to say that a good looking face is not what makes a drama good... If you think that the FL is annoying because she is badly written... then great! I agree. If you think she is ""not good enough."" for the so called perfect ML then please reply to me so we can fight... A metric ton of these reviews REEK of misogyny. I don't understand how people can continuously dunk on the FL while praising the ML to death. BOTH are shallow and underdeveloped and still continue to be as of the most recent. Going off of the summary I thought I'd be getting an intelligent melodrama that touches on the struggles of fame, parasocial relationships and the viciousness of depression... maybe a little commentary on living with disabilities (since Sol was not disabled in the original story) but since EP 3 It's turned into a generic rom com with ANOTHER serial killer subplot that comes out of nowhere and Sol's disability has become non-existent. Yay proper representation and social commentary!Also the writers have made Im Sol annoying, unserious and illogical when it comes to her ""goal"". On the other hand Ryu Sun Jae is a boring paper cutout who also never feels like a real person. His existence revolves around the FL, every action he takes is in response to her and her feelings and he never manages to develop a solid character of his own. Swimming was Ryu Sunjae's whole life but he got over not being able to do it anymore super quick? Why? Because he likes Im Sol? Once again I could imagine a better show showing the ML struggling under the weight of possibly being a disappointment or just dealing with pressure at a very young age , which could have naturally led into exploring his depression. I don't feel anything because nothing feels earned... I need more than pretty faces for a drama to be a 10/10. The amount of people who are saying this show is PERFECT makes me feel like I'm in the twilight zone. It's not as bad as More than Friends but this is not going to be a memorable masterpiece like last year's Twinkling Watermelon or My Dearest.It's trying so hard to be Twinkling Watermelon without attempting to do any of the heavy lifting. Very disappointing.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Only after seeing the first episode, without even realizing it, was I hooked on this drama. The plot, their acting, comic timing, music, and the detailing of everything were all on point. The heartwarming feeling I felt ages ago while seeing old kdramas is the same as what I felt for this one. Never in my life have I been this obsessed with any other kdrama. Both actors are perfectly suited for their respective roles. They're so good, I have no words. Sunjaeyaa is the most special character I've fallen in love with, and Im Sol is the girl that every Sunjae deserves. The power of Soljae is so strong that it has moved all of our hearts. All credit goes to Byeon Woo Seok, the perfect man, actor, and singer, and Hye Yoon, who has the power to connect with people's emotions through her acting. This drama literally made our boring Mondays and Tuesdays very interesting. From the beginning till the end not a single episode is boring (for me). Every episode leaves a lasting impact on us, making us wonder what might happen in the next episodes. A must-watch drama. I'm eagerly waiting for another drama where we can meet Sunjae Yaa and Sol Aa. Only after that will I be able to move on from this emptyness. I love them so much.

All the characters in the drama have their own ""points"" of why they are there and not just some kind of random ""extras"". There is no single second that I skipped, because every scene was either, funny, romantic, cute, and more. I usually like to skip some parts when watching drama because they get too boring at times, but this one is so great that I didnt need to skip.

tt31324295,"When i first saw the poster of this drama i thought this is gonna be another teenage drama slice of life story but when i saw the teaser it's definitely not. I am a kpop fan myself and i can really relate to the female lead. This drama showcase every fan's genuine love for their kpop idol. This drama is really interesting it transformed the original manhwa in profound way. They retained the part where the male lead died and his fan time traveled to save him but the story is way too different from the manhwa. I loved how they change the plot in the drama where the female and male lead past are intertwined where we thought that Im Sol was the first to fall for Sun Jae but the truth is it's the other way around. He fell first and fell harder as time goes by. I can also relate to Sun Jae's dilemma of liking someone from afar. Some people may think that Sun Jae's falling for Im Sol just because of the umbrella scene is shallow but for me it's not. It's always the simple things and sincere gestures that matters. They were teenagers for godsake. Who didn't experience the joy of puppy love? She was his first love and who are we to question that? He didn't even got the chance to confess his love for her due to tragic accident that caused her disability and hate for him which she forget then later on we found out that the accident is an attempted murder after all. Ryu Seon Jae in the manhwa died in the beginning due to overdose of his medicine somewhat suicide but in the drama we also thought that he took his life but in fact he was murdered by the serial killer he was pushed from the balcony of his home. Then we get to see the female lead futile multiple attempts in changing their past to alter the future. There are certain scenes that they could have prevented if only Im Sol trusted Sun Jae such as the part where they parted on the train scene I was kinda frustrated with Im Sol that time she should have went home with them to prevent her altered future from happening. She's kinda impulsive at some point and make irrational decisions. I wished they made Im Sol's character not this reckless with faulty memories and make her trust Sun Jae instead of always pushing him away and confuses him with her behavior. Kim Hye Yoon is a top tier actress and I think she deserves to play a role of a female lead with rational choices. But overall this drama is so good that there's no boring episode it will make you binge watch this the whole day. This is one of the best romcom drama I've ever seen there's no corny jokes at all. This will give you all the feels heartbreak, nostalgia, frustrations, excitement, euphoric happiness and etc. The romantic scenes are not cringy at all it's so natural chemistry is chef's kiss they're like a match made in heaven. Even the OSTs are perfect you can listen to them nonstop. Their choice for the member of Eclipse band is perfect too. Their visuals and talent as a band is really giving. Byeon Woo Seok as Ryu Sun Jae is the probably the best choice the producers made. The production for this drama was delayed for three years due to actors declining the male lead role but I can say that it's for the best. They found the perfect embodiment of Ryun Sun Jae in Byeon Woo Seok. It's been a really long since the last time I got emotionally invested in a Kdrama. Lovely Runner will always have a soft spot in my heart. This drama made me realize that Mondays isn't very bad at all.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

The plot barely make sense with why the murderer is obsessed with the main characters, yet it led to the most anti climatic ending too..Also, worst and poor use of time travel plot.. either way, it seems like the drama itself was a success, so maybe it's just me. It feels more suited for teenagers. Then with the whole push and pull of the characters due to the events happening to them was also annoying and silly - typically a young teen's thinking, despite they're meant to be at a mental age of 30+..Ended up finishing it since I was so far in, by was very disappointed.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Well, first, I want to say about the story of the series and the characters:
Serial couples are very close.Soul is very cute and despite his many misdeeds, I think he is one of the logical characters in the story.Sonjeh has a proud personality and when he secretly laughs, I really laugh.Even though they go back to the future in episodes 7 and 8, but none of them change, Soul is still as cute and Sonje is secretly enjoying it.Soul's friend is also really funny and the friends of the serial couples are one of the humorous points of the story.Sonje's father, who is no longer heard of, really made me laugh, especially in the part where the antenna was sticking out of his pants or when he fell from the table., the series is saying that a small decision and movement of yours in the past overshadows a large part of your future and it is really worth considering.In my opinion, filming; stage design; Serial songs; Actors play; The design of the clothes and everything up to this point was great.I hope that the serial couple will finally get together and Woo Suk will not die like in other movies and series.I hope it has a happy ending.And that I really like Sonje to understand what Soul is trying to keep alive.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Additionally, please follow Hye Yoon on Instagram and show her the love and support she truly deserves, as she has not yet received the full recognition from Korean netizens. Let's give her the appreciation she merits for her outstanding performance.""Lovely Runner"" became a massive hit not just because of its compelling plot, but due to the extraordinary depiction of the genuine connection and love shared between Sun Jae and Sol. The drama's success is largely thanks to the outstanding performances of both actors. Our sunshine couple, Solsun/Soljae, became the biggest ship of 2024 because viewers were convinced that what they saw on screen was pure. We all crave that soul connection, and ""Lovely Runner"" delivers it perfectly.Sun Jae's character, willing to wait 15 years, and Sol's determination to traverse countless timelines to save the love of her life, give us hope and belief in true love. The emotional scenes made us cry our hearts out, while the witty and wholesome exchanges between the couple made us laugh hard. Both Hye Yoon and Woo Seok are phenomenal actors who have finally received the love and recognition they truly deserve after years of hard work.It's hard to move on from a drama you've attached yourself to so wholeheartedly.

And I've been ignoring this show for a long time even though I always see it in my feeds every time I scroll through fb, I'm already spoiled because of the posts, memes, and clips that are scattered. I really don't have time to watch Kdrama at the moment but luckily we had a long weekend and I couldn't stand it anymore so I watched it even though it was still on-going. Every episode is really addictive, I never fell asleep, I never fast forwarded unlike the previous Kdramas that I won't name but I couldn't finish because I have a lot pending on my list hahahaha but this? I actually finished it within the day hahahaha their silly funny moments are so funny. The joy that this show made me feel is the same level as my joy in the funny moments of Waikiki and Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok Joo. Tbh I was not attracted to byeon woo seok before I watched him several times in Soulmate as well as the 20th century girl and strong woman nam soon.Here in the lovely runner he has a different kind of charm, he really looks like a kpop idol. His voice is also beautiful, I'm in love with Sudden Shower, i can't believe he can really sing then at the scene of eclipse concert while Sunjae was singing sudden shower was different, I just cried because it was so melancholic when he sang. If only they could have a concert as if I could watch if ever bwahahaha. But overall, Lovely Runner is really beautiful, even though I wanted to strangle that taxi driver/killer just to resolve their problems, im sol is frustrating sometimes, she is so reckless and stubborn, i have nothing against hye yoon, she is a very good actress I'll cry and then laugh, it's so hard, I'll blame the writers of the story for my frustrations with her character hahahabut because of this show, I feel like I'm in high school again, the feeling is so nostalgic while I'm watching it, it's like falling in love again nowadays because it just makes me feel better than Kdrama bwaahahaha because I didn't experience that kind of love in my teenage years hahaha but thankful for this drama, it became my escape from the harsh reality of life hahahahaaaays.

tt31324295,"""Let's Kidnap Sun Jae and run"".Wearing this on her headgear, Im Sol arrives to attend a concert of her favorite star Ryu Sun Jae. Bound on a wheelchair the thirty-something lost her ticket and was forced to enjoy the show from outside of the auditorium. Her agony vanishes as she meets the star on her way home. But was it their first time meeting?Ever since its inception, the love of Im Sol and Sun Jae has undergone more changes than the weather itself. Im Sol who has been fangirling over Sun Jae finds him as her next-door neighbor as she travels back to 2009. Seeing her dead K-pop star alive makes her feel alive again and the chaotic love story begins.Attempting to time travel love is not a big thing for Korean dramas. The list is endless, from Scarlett Heart Ryeo to Go Back Couple, to recently ended Marry My husband.Then, why Lovely Runner is creating so much hype:1. The timelineSol is not living in a fixed time zone. She has travelled through various time of her life, while looking for ways to save Sun Jae. Some time, she is living for few months and sometime she is living for few days. It is like a staycation and not a total shift to that time zone.2. Differences in charactersCharacters are different. Modern Sol is polar opposite of her eighteen year old self. In fact, as she is going back to modern time, her cackling eighteen year old self is coming back. Sun Jae is not aware, so his character is not facing any transition in the process.3. Constant changesIt is very important to keep audience hooked. Monotonous storyline make audience wander whether to watch the next episode or not. However, in this story, the suspense is getting bigger with the magic of time travelling. Whether Sol will have her feet or Sun Jae will live...the answer is still uncertain.The story deserves an extra credit for giving space to additional characters of the story.The new arc of character of Seo Hye Won and Song Ji Ho not only add humor to the tale but also add perfect love dose in the story of Sol and Sun Jae. As the story grows, not only love blooms but the threat intensifies. Now a days, Korean dramas loses track after the twelfth episode, but lovely runner ahs successfully kept the charm and suspicion alive. The future of the endearing couple is still behind clouds. Song Geon Hee in the role of sweet and savory Tae Sung has got little to do. The second lead got back seated by the shine of Byeon Woo seok. The director should have drew his role in a better light. His bromance with Sun Jae looked warm but is not creating goosebumps. We still miss our Jun Pyo and Ji Hoo. The supporting cast including well known ajumma and ajusshis are brilliant in their shoes but it is Im Sol and Sun Jae who are eating the cream in chunks.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

To make us like them?, because they were both terrible people to be honest and dull.Every actor besides Lee Chaemin also looked lifeless. Literally no emotion. The only good thing about this show is maybe the visuals, but tbh even with the good looking actors, it still sucks.Don't watch this show. It's a waste of time.

I also liked Lee chaemin acting Even though it's my first time watching his drama. Even though I found big gaps in the drama, the scriptwriter tried to close the gaps, even if it was ridiculous, towards the end. We saw a new murder at the end of the series, but I don't think I will watch it if there is a second season. The first season was enough for me for now. This is my first review, I will continue to write from now on.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"You'd expect it to be full of drama and revenge plots, but it's not. The first few episodes were interesting because the drama was starting to show the chaos around Jooshin High due to the elite students' lifestyles and personalities. It got boring the more episodes I watched. The ending felt rushed; just a complete lackluster. The plot was so flat. I remember Kang Ha saying ""I'm just getting started"" at the LAST episode. He got so distracted with Jae-I and it seemed like he forgot the real reason he went to Jooshin High. He didn't even do a proper investigation. I got the points of friendship and the struggle of each student but the ending didn't feel right. I only liked Rian's development due to Jae-I's influence, but even then he didn't get a punishment for all he's done. He was still a normal student in Jooshin High.Overall, props and cinematography is good. Characters are meh, storyline was had no depth. If it was food, I'd say it's good pasta with tap water as a sauce.It was disappointing. It could've been better.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I was so disappointed that the ml didnt end up with jae-i. She had more chemistry with him than ria-n. I feel like kang ha didn't actually get justice because all the rich kids were able to live happy lives. This show didnt satisfy me at all. Jae-i is the only one who wasn't really a part of the bullying but she got the worst of it, its honestly not fair. And the reviews saying kang ha is in the wrong for liking her, they didn't even watch the show. Woojin was also missing for half the show and didnt receive any consequences for his actions, but i guess revealing evidence to the police counts?? Honestly the writing is also meh but it was such an entertaining watch. Idk why the hate is so extreme lmao.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I debated about giving this an 8/10, but settled on 7/10 because the story just wasn't credible, and some of the acting just wasn't good. The setting is a prestigious school Nobless Oblige where those at the top enjoy privileges through money and title but also by sometimes cruelly enforcing a pecking order, especially of the scholarship students who struggle just to get through a day without harassment and bullying. One actor, who played the leading scholarship-student role-Lee Chae-Mim as Kang ha-deserves a 9/10 for his portrayal of the avenging, fraternal-twin brother, who accepted a scholarship to the school motivated solely by uncovering what happened at that school that led up to and included his brother's death, which had been shamefully covered up. I found myself really rooting for him throughoutt. It was so satisfying to see him so confidently stand up to and outwit the bullies who had so tormented his brother. He also does a great job of bringing out the best in those around him, which even though it felt somewhat unbelievable, his character remained flawlessly consistent and believable. It's well worth watching, and I should mention that despite some fair acting and scriptwriting, the filmmaking and soundtrack were very good.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

tt27763561,"At 30 reviews, this drama has quite a bimodal distribution. The boy does not get the girl. The killing is an accident. The revenge, at least in first season, is not fully executed. It seems more of a story of redemption, up to the final scene after the credits, where it looks like the villain and the hero might actually trade places in season 2. Overall, a refreshing plot that breaks some mainstream expectations. I liked the maturity represented. I like how some characters come to a place of maturity. The real villains seem the parents, and only working class are really punished, the teacher (presumably prison, and the principal, fired).

The revenge is all gone and it jst sticks with stupid romance and girl ends up with the boy who bullied his brother then what about his brother death. Waste of time don't watch it.

There was nothing wrong with it and I have no reasons to not give it 10 stars. I watched the first episode and knew I had to continue watching and i didn't get bored even once what doesn't happen often so I have to say for me it was a really good and I can only recommend to watch it.

tt27763561,"Well, it was fun I would say but it just feels soooooo empty of everything. The emotions? The relationships? Many things you just cannot connect with.So my Ian problem was the revenge for his brother. A poor boy who was bullied and then killed. I mean the actor did good job ( kinda?) portraying the angry twin brother HOWEVER, He is defending a girl who was one of the main reasons why his brother got bullied and instead of feeling anger and hate he is simply simping over her and keep asking her why she is not choosing him ( like boy aren't you here for your dead brother wth r u doing?). Also in the last episodes when she confessed ( I killed him), his response was weird. I don't know but that quick love between these two characters was very very weirdAnother thing is how easy was the revenge thing. Like went to the police and what? Where is the revenge man. I don't know but disappointing and the bullies deserved much more. Why they are showing us their cute lovely friendship moments while trying to show them as ""nice people"". Idc what anyone says about these characters but they are awful people. A little ""story"" is not enoughLastly, the stupid love triangle. The girl is deeply in love with her boyfriend but at the end she says she felt something towards the guy? Huh? And at that villa why she told him she felt that kiss too? I am sorry I am confused ?????In general story was very good at the beginning but it got very random. I didn't like any character also.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,It started soooo strong. So full of potential. I was thinking the glory. The first 3 episodes where great. You are guessing. The female lead was annoying. Hot-cold. But I think it was just the character. Just spoiled rich kids. And even the poor kids are spoiled horrible human beings.I do get it. Everything in this drama is caused by bad bad parenting. And adults being worse then the kids. No wonder they go adrift.As soon as the mystery dropped. The show went downhill.There was no fulfilling revenge. It was meh.The acting was at some scenes on point.They are hinting at a second season but I really don't know if this is just an open ending or if there will be a second season. I don't know If I'm watching. Maybe just to know who killed. And why.6/10 some good scenes and I did like the lead character searching revenge. A drama to watch for beauty.,negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"The background of the kdrama is nothing new. Rich kids in high school screwing around, and someone is revenging. Cliche aside, this story is garbage. The main character ran into the school and broadcasted to everyone that he's trying to revenge his victim brother, and the guy doesn't even have a plan to execute his revenge. He conveniently found a guy with some info he could use against the bullies, and he gather everyone to go against the bullies without any resistance. Everyone just agreed to standup against the bullies together. If it was that easy, why do we even need the main character? And why hasn't anyone tried yet? The best of all is that the main character kept saying he's got a plan, and he's got more revenge to come. And then the show ended. Where are your plans?! You did like 3 things! At the end, every bullies suddenly became nice and admit to their wrongdoings. Really lazy writing and a complete waste of the casts.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Hierarchy the name itself give feel something royal although it's a school teen based drama where its show the discrimination over wealth.

In all combined it's just so confusing and unnecessary. So many details were omitted.Second, actors. All act poorly - at least male lead and some leading actors were okay.

tt27763561,"This drama is like being presented with a fine wine, but getting served water instead. Very weak storyline. They lure you in with, what should be, a really good revenge/mystery plot but give you a story that's dull and not well written. The actors did the best they could with what they were given and how they were directed, so I can't fault them. With the exception of Lee Chae-Min, I found the others needed more guidance in their portrayals as they seemed like lifeless puppets reciting lines. No emotions really, their eyes remained blank. Plus, sorry gentlemen but the only character I found intimidating was played by Choi Won-Young. The story is too fast paced as well, revealing things way too soon without proper foundation, like the writer kept coming up with last minute ideas and implemented them before solidifying their base in the story. One last thing, I felt the whole 'love' storyline between the 2 top rich students was both unnecessary and emotionless.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

tt27763561,"The synopsis of the hierarchy system in elite school setting like jooshin high school is to be expected. Personally I liked the character Rian, who is the richest most powerful character in the series. They made him out to be the antagonist of the series but he's actually a good guy. They paint him to be the bad guy because his followers carry out beatings and stuff on his behalf but he never orders any of it. Her us another interesting character because they paint her to be a bad person but she has a soft heart (especially after she breaks down crying after she told jaei that they were never friends). Jae-i's character was made to be the weakest imo because she is from one of the wealthiest families but they made her out to be weak and had most of the burden on her shoulders alone. She easily could have told her bf RI-an and he could have handled everything himself but they let her be weak on her own. The protagonist of the show Kang-ha does not make sense because his twin brother was weak and a target of bullying but somehow he is the exact opposite and strong enough to oppose the bad rich kids. Thought that was a bad representation of his character. Hope there is a stronger 2nd season because they can do so much better.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"A big budget, beautiful actors and sceneries, and nice cars could not propel this KDrama to the level of others that share the same tropes.

Other characters- awesome opportunities to explore how they could have pushed the plot, but didn't.Unnecessary parents- did not impact or improve anything.Avenge your brother-period. Nope. Let's ""change the school's culture"". Unrealistic outcomes based on a lackluster plot and mediocre acting.Romance? Let's race to see if we stay together (Boys over Flowers vibes). They tried to have a triangle, but that failed.The ""blackmail"" idea became tiresome by the end. This could have been so awesome with some twists.The biggest letdown, IMO, were the underdeveloped relationships, irrelevant flashbacks, and overall failure to launch (all over the place).Watch it.

I cannot express how good hierarchy is, it's just something you must see for yourself. From the cast to the plot and even the OSTs, it is perfect in my humble opinion. Without a doubt one of my favourites this year. Thats why i was initially flabbergasted as to why the overall ratings are so unbelievably low. I could really go in depth about every detail of hierarchy but just know that once you start watching episode 1 you will find yourself binging it until the end. I will be eagerly awaiting a season two as soon as possible.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I just finished watching Hierarchy on Netflix without even seeing the trailer beforehand. Based on the series poster, I suspected it would be the Korean version of Gossip Girl, Elite, and Pretty Little Liars. After watching it, my initial impression remains unchanged. The plot is predictable, and the twists were not surprising.Set in Jooshin High School, the most prestigious school in South Korea, the series follows the lives of elite students who are chosen at birth to attend. These include Jeong Jae Yi, the first daughter of the Jaeyool Group; Kim Ri An, the successor of the Jooshin Group; Yoon He Ra, the youngest daughter of a trading company; and Lee Woo Jin, the second son of a powerful political family. In contrast, the poorer students are portrayed as content, wise, cheerful, and grounded.The story takes a turn when Kang Ha transfers to Jooshin High School. Behind his innocent smile lies a secret that threatens to unravel the entire establishment. As typical of high school/teen suspense dramas, the protagonist from a poor background faces bullying from the wealthy students, who are linked to a mysterious death. The teachers and administrators turn a blind eye to the privileged students' bad behavior. The series also delves into the imperfect family lives of the rich students, highlighting the pressures of maintaining reputations, inheriting businesses, and dealing with envy.While Hierarchy isn't disappointing, it also isn't exceptional. The storytelling isn't seamless and at times feels forced. However, there are several redeeming qualities. The production values are impressive, with every shot looking expensive and meticulously designed. The cinematography is stunning, with flawless color grading and cinematic visuals. The background music is catchy and perfectly conveys the emotions of each scene.Overall, Hierarchy is a decent, time-pass drama. It's not a waste of time, but it doesn't stand out either. If you enjoy western teen dramas like Elite, you might find this series enjoyable. Just don't go in with high expectations.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"The first chapter is promising but after that is in a non stop decline. Slow paced, unnecessarily, and with an inconsistent plot.A lot of sighs and time of reflection in silence from the characters that make the time pass super slow. The parents of the students are very cartoonish, not very credible.It could be better managed in terms of mystery and tension. The story resolves in a very boring way and everyone is ridiculously redeemed. The bad people is not that bad by the end, the good people forgive kind of easily and all end happy. Absurd. It was a murder and abuse story and you have the feeling it was not important after all. Don't watch it, don't make my mistake.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"The show is complicated, captivating, reflective, and overall good.I love that the story isn't that plain and obvious (the guy comes and has revenge for his brother's killers/bullies) in this show there are complicated relationships and complicated circumstances of the death of his brother. There is a question of love between teenagers, there is an empowerment journey. Every character has its journey, dilemmas, and questionable actions.I love a good revenge story (The Glory is one of my favorites if not the favorite show on that subject), but this is more of a story where one guy disrupts everyone's perfect lives.There is a scared girl who will take life into her own hands, there is an insecure girl who will find her way, and there is a bad guy whom no one should love but he receives the love, there is the hurt guy without any fear with only shir determination but with a good heart, there is secret love, there are scared followers.A lot of people questioned the ending and this is my thoughts on this...
There should have been more consequences and that is my criticism of the show.I would have made one more episode because the last one is all over the place, and I would include revenge victory where we can see guilty parties suffer the consequences.I don't want to spoil some things so I will not get into it more.The ending could have been better, but it's good enough if they make season 2 to clarify and improve some things. I think that story is worth it.And that is why the show should have more than a 7.1 but less than a 7.6 rating overall in my opinion.If there was a better ending I would argue that the rating should be around 8.4..10 isn't the right rating but I gave it to this show because I saw that few people gave it a 1, 2, or 3,4 (which is stupid on its own), and a 6.1 rating overall doesn't do its justice. This show is good and the right rating should be more than 7.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Why in the heck did I watch all 7 episodes in this (thankfully) short series? It started off really interesting but it lost me somewhere around episode 3 1/2. I guess I kept watching because I thought that at least some of the monstrously entitled characters: Jae-Ri, Kim Ri-An and their coterie of sycophants would somehow CONVINCINGLY tranform into better human beings. But that never happened. And the one decent character, Kang Ha just got less interesting because of his joke of a dumb crush on a girl with the allure of a designer doormat. The finale/Episode 7 was the worst episode of all. A coda of inconsequential duhhh-like-we-didn't-know-all-this-already moments, hollow mea culpas and the obligatory throwing of a posse of nobodies under the bus. Our series' unloved hero, Kang Ha just fades into the background while the 2 characters (who I couldn't stand) take over the series' final scenes. Side notes: Jae-Ri is disturbingly weak both physically and mentally, yet still manages to be consistently imperious around her sassy so-called best friend. How Kang Ha fell in love with her at first sight was unfathomable-unless maybe in Korea it's normal to worship ice queens with blank stares. And why did the drama feature most of the rich kid's parents but scholarship student KangHa is presented like some parentless possibly homeless nobody from nowhere? I sort of wondered if it would turn out that this was a clue that Kang Ha wasn't real- that he was a revenging ghost figure. (Think Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider.) Now that would have been a worth sticking around for twist. And Yo Netflix! Don't order another season of Hierarchy unless you can fire the Season 1 writers. They totally dropped the ball.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I quite enjoyed the drama and it is not clear why it is condemned and it receives such bad reviews, it is a bit like an American drama, it is true, after all, it is a Netflix production. I don't understand why the viewers should compare it to other dramas. I think that beyond the plot, (which is not bad at all) there are some difficult social criticisms in it, concerning the humiliating attitude of parents towards their children, the humiliating attitude of the rich towards the poor, the humiliating attitude of teachers towards students and the humiliating attitude of students towards students (and this is seen in many Korean dramas. They all bring everyone to the edge of their mental endurance.Maybe because I am also a mother of twins, the story touched a sensitive chord with me. ..it's also not clear why Netflix doesn't mean that in episode 7 after the subtitles there is another and very significant section for the end of the series ..that many viewers don't notice and think that the drama ends with the leading woman arriving at her mother's house?? The series had a great soundtrack, the actors were great...all in all, not a bad drama at all and since Netflix defined it as a ""limited series"", I guess there is no second season and it's a shame, because it was left with another murder that you can hardly understand who was murdered (perhaps on purpose) and the end open, and has the good man become the bad man?",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

Watching a thriler is always fun. And here thriller has been served right.2. Fresh chemistry: Chemistry does not lie within leads only. The performance observed between characters in charge of pulling the story must align well which is identified in the story.3. Performance delivered by actors have been terrific. They bore the burden of pulling the story well off.Why skip..1. Same hierarchy issue in school. Korea should focus on reducing this hierarchy order in their school. They infact harbour bullies in school more than in other place.2. Well know theme makes the story predictable at many places. Even though twist is fresh, you just know what's coming next.VerdictA school drama with no melodramatic love angle.

tt27763561,"As an avid viewer, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on ""Hierarchy."" The low ratings and negative comments have truly irked me, especially when some critics seem to miss the mark entirely.Firstly, let's address the naysayers who label the show as ""predictable."" Frankly, they likely didn't exercise the patience to watch the post-credits scene. Surprise plot twists abound, catching even the most seasoned viewers off guard. Trust me, no one saw that coming!Comparing ""Hierarchy"" to other K-dramas like ""The Heirs"" or ""The Glory"" is an apples-to-oranges situation. This show stands in a class of its own. It doesn't mimic or strive to be anything else-it's an original narrative, distinct and refreshing.Now, the revenge storyline. Critics who dismiss it as ""bad"" miss the point entirely. Just because it didn't unfold precisely as they envisioned doesn't render it terrible. The storytelling approach is unique, weaving threads of suspense and intrigue.WATCH!!!! SO GOOD!!! 😉🎬",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Where do I start here. This was the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time watching this. This story is about the lead actor going supposedly undercover to expose the school because his brother died of a supposed car accident. The problem here is that he tells practically everyone what he is going to do. How dumb is that. Then he can't even defend himself. Why then does he act so tough when he can't back it up. Then they flash back to when his brother gets hit by the car and the culprit is the hot teacher who was messing around with the other student. The dead student actually got what he deserved. If you noticed the only ones getting bullied was the friend that tried to help the male lead, the principals son and the male lead. The other scholarship students did what they had to and weren't bothered too much, so why didn't the brother do the same? What business of it was his to get upset that the hottie teacher was getting it on with the male student in the staircase. She was even nice to him. I really don't understand who wrote this garbage. In the end the male lead gives the police the video evidence and the responsible person goes to jail and then he becomes friendly with the bullies and that is the end. As for the casting of this crap. He-Ra should have been the lead instead of the other actress. She is more attractive and has a better way of carrying herself. The only reason I kept watching this is because of her and the hottie teacher and also hoping that this would get better. Unfortunately it did not. Netflix please Do not renew this garbage !!! Please bring back girl from nowhere and mafia princess. It seems that Netflix only renews garbage.

tt27763561,A young man (In Han) on a scholarship to an elite school is bullied unmercifully and gets run over and killed whilst running away from said bullies.His fraternal twin brother (Kang Ha) enters the same school on a scholarship to hunt down and punish those responsible.Of course he meets a girl (Jai I) and forms a crush on her. She has recently broken up with the leader of the school bullies (Ri-an) and she won't tell him why.This reason turns out to be so illogical and unnecessary - not to mention unfair - that you can only sigh when it is revealed.The story continues (I won't say progresses) with scenes of rich kids beating up poor kids and examples of discrimination and unfairness whereby there are certain rooms reserved for the rich which the poor can't enter - they have to wear different ties etc.Eventually Kang Ha finds out what happened to his brother - and very late in the day - who was responsible for his death. Of course there is the inevitable hateful parents who treat their children as commodities. Jae-I's dad (the excellent Choi Won Young) is a major bad guy in this.The story is weak and derivative - the young actors have not had much experience and it shows. They are mainly passionless and expressionless in equal measure. It was oddly uninvolving and the ending was a total let-down. Being a Kdrama connoisseur no review would be complete without mentioning what they are most famous for - the kisses !! There were precious few of them and that was probably a blessing because they were very very poor. There was very little chemistry between Jai. I and Ri-an - Jai-I in particular looked barely conscious throughout the entire series.It is such a shame that Studio Dragon seems to be struggling with it's writers these days - and bigger stars seem to be avoiding them.With this level of output - I am not surprised.,negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

The revenge was so unsatisfying. The bullies deserved to be punished, Ri-an especially. Also, WE DONT CARE ABOUT THOSE COUPLES (rian and jae). We wanted a great revenge for Kang Ha's brother!!!! Why didnt they suffer as much?! Kang Ha was shown max like 10 minutes. He couldve been so cool if be actually did some revenge. That teacher's little BF shouldve been in juvy or smthn??

The bullying shown in this drama is something I have seen many time before in Kdramas and is quite prevalent in South Korea's schools and colleges.The show's story screams how much it is influenced by spanish drama ""Elite"". All the bullying, sex, drugs, filthy rich morons and their brats, parties, pregnancy ..... just reminded me of it.It is another disappointment after ""The Impossible Heir"" although the acting is goo didn't even want to give this drama one star.

It just a little more plot and add he-ra and woojin as the main character and I'm down to recommend all of my friends to watch it.Please ignore all the hate comments, I'm sure you guys can fix it by giving us season 2, you guys have so much potential, LITERALLY ALL THE CAST ARE GOLD (especially Ji Hye-won and Lee Won-jung, I ship them so much), the plot just need a revision tbh, the rommance needed revision as well, WHY CANT WOOJIN AT LEAST BE WITH HE-RA?",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

The acting is extremely poor, with everyone overacting to the point where it feels like a high school play. Every scene is exaggerated to the max, making it all seem overly dramatic and unrealistic. The plot, what little I saw of it, was unengaging and cliché. Even as a background show while doing other things, it's just too grating to endure. Save your time and skip this one. There are far better shows out there that deserve your attention. This one simply isn't worth the investment.

If you're gonna criticise the show, at least properly finish the series first. Don't believe the people saying that this show is 'predictable' because chances are they wasn't even patient enough to watch the post credits scene. I know damn well no one expected that plot twist. Now, the people who are comparing hierarchy to other shows like 'the heirs' or 'the glory' are just invalid because you can't compare this to another K-drama. It's not copying or trying to be this or that, hierarchy is it's own original story and is literally a class of its own. Im sick of critics saying that this was a bad revenge story. Just because it didn't go how you wanted it to, doesn't mean you can sit there and say it's terrible. The story telling was unique and the only bad aspect of this show that I can think of is it's only seven episodes long and I can't wait for season two, which will be even better than the first season by a lot and then people will shut up and realise that this show is goated. If you are still deciding whether or not to watch hierarchy then just go for it, it's shorter than most K-dramas on netflix so there's nothing to lose.

tt27763561,"Another average high school drama about bullying, tangled relations, hierarchy and what not? I'm here for it!I am guilty of liking this overused genre a lot, and there are a few dramas that are actually pretty impressive. But this is definitely not it. And one of the major reason being v poorly written characters.Overall portrayal of a lot of characters was just flawed and conflicting towards the end.1. Jae I - I seriously don't understand why was she so unnecessarily secretive about the blackmail and pregnancy stuff. Why did she just disappear and ignore ri an like that and come up with break up out of nowhere? Like this is just so insane that guy would literally turn the world upside down for the girl why act so helpless??And what was that in the end did she like two men at the same time? Umm excuse me?!2. Ri an - other than the fact that the actor was really bad with his expressions, I just did not find his character v impactful.3. He ra - omg she has gotta be one of the most confusing characters everrr. Like from the start it seems she is super jealous of jae i. But the ending made them seem so full of love and all. Like hello? A girl that deceives you to get your man? Nope she can never be a friend. Just ridiculous. Also are we just gonna pretend she was not a bully at all? Why was she not questioned at all.4. Kang ha - even though he seemed the most normal of all, I just did not like his chemistry with the FL. I mean I did like them together initially but after going through jae i and ri an' s past, kang ha did not really fit in the picture. Also he seemed kinda goal oriented so confessing to jae i at the end was not really needed when you know how much she loves ri an. But what's even wilder is she implied she liked him briefly like whatt?Just a v complicated- unnecessary- spiced up drama filled plot that you're better off sleeping on. Honestly, would not recommend.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"It was really good, many valid problems of each character showed how vulnerable people are.Jae-i was expressionless the entire show, but she had a rough past. I found He-ra slightly annoying when I first watched it, she had all the wrong thoughts about her best friend. Kang Ha proctecting Jae-i is cute though, he has an amazing personality whose willing to stand up for her. In-han's story is so unfortunate, his journey in Jooshin High School just highlights how bad bullying can be. Ri-an on the other hand, he wasn't exactly my favorite. He used his power of an own personal gain. So far cool series.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I'm a huge fan of the Spanish show Elite ( till the 3rd season atleast ) and I expected something similar with Hierarchy. To an extent it was and that's why I rate this 5/10.The best part of the show was it's only 7 episodes and wasn't dragged out. The suspense and the end to it was satisfactory.The two male leads are the saving grace of this show. In my opinion they're not great actors yet, still young and raw, but they're okay enough to carry a show.The female lead playing Jung Jae I needs to eat something. Hopefully then she will have the energy to act and give different expressions.Worth one time watch and would watch if there's a season 2.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

The dialogue was so on the nose starting maybe ep 3-4, I just started fast-forwarding. The episodes felt increasingly cringey and incoherent in ep 5-7. The ending scene where the ML delivers a monologue to the FL is so random and over the top. The characters were all very bland and unconvincing overall. Pretty C tier.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"It's obvious a second season will be coming after that ending - I hope everyone was patient with the credits to see the actual final little bit at end. So who did it? The ML and his TXT at the end with his sinister smile - more mystery to solve. I personally loved this series. It was full of mystery, romance, society's class problems, family problems, egos, revenge, selfishness, action and more. The actors did a great job; yes they were a bit cold as some might call it - was waiting for the FL to soften up a little bit along the way and she did smile one or twice near the end but she always kept that coolness pretty much throughout which is part of the character due to her suffering so much alone with what happened to her and what her father puts her through as well. All in all 7 episodes is easy and fun to watch and also an odd number for a K-Drama which is another reason am expecting more.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

I think
This one was the most awful one!I just waisted my time
You cant feel anything from actors
Not love , sadness,happiness,even anger.....
A meaningless story
I didn't understand what was the goal of this movie ? To showing what?Revenge?love? Separation? You failed as it all .The girl of first role (jiei) was always like walls
Without soul and any feelings.The boy (kang ha ) he wanted to get revenge but what happened? He forgot about his own brother ?This was an insult to the intelligence of the audience.The best part of the show was just (woo jin) he was hot and thats all .This kdrama was sooo failed 👎🏻",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I don't watch a huge number of K-Dramas, but some of them are amazingly compelling. I just binged through this in 2 days and I'm ready for season 2.It was billed as ""The Glory"" levels of revenge and I didn't feel that vibe at all. Maybe because they were all still in high school, and it wasn't revenge that had been plotted for years. It just felt a lot less intense.And less intense isn't bad. Scenes in The Glory were painful to watch and I was constantly tense... I didn't feel that with this so I could just relax and blow through it.I found myself not really hating anyone. The characters were all sad and complicated in their own way, even the bullies. I wanted to hate the rich kids, but then they show us their vulnerable parts and instead of hating them, I just wanted to shake them until they stopped being jerks.I also didn't really love anyone. I did like Kang Ha and Jae-i and I rooted for both of them. What Jae-i went through explained a lot about her, but we never, even when she was alone, really saw any emotion from her which made it hard to connect.The big thing for me was that the resolution of the mystery felt anti-climactic. It sort of seemed like Kang Ha had decided who was to blame and even when he learned the truth (or most of it) he didn't really change his track.But I will definitely watch season 2. I'd love to see more of all of them and the after credit scene really has me interested.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"'' Hierarchy '' is a school melodrama that is more about the cinematography than the story. In other words, is more about looks than substance.The story is pretty basic, makjang style, with some rich kids terrorizing the poor students while dealing with their own personal drama. Still, there were some interesting elements at the start of the drama, with some intriguing plotlines.However, as the series progressed, the story got more and more loose, getting boring to boot.As for the romance, or love triangle, it was boring and the leads didn't really have any chemistry.Also, they tried hard to make the rich kids look extra, but they just ended up not looking like teenagers, but rich makjang housewives.At least the performances were enjoyable.So, overall, three out of ten.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

If it was a proper revenge drama or romance it would have been good. But it has nothing. From episode four it was soo bad that i just skipped to the end(cuz I don't stop a drama before finishing it) The max rating I could give is 3/10 only cuz of some scenes of friendship. This drama literally had no sense. Started like a revenge then went to romance and ending in nothing. I would never recommend this to anyone.

tt27763561,"I lost 7 hours. The FL character doesn't make sense, she has no personality, she is just there, always looking emotionless. Plus she almost does nothing. I never really understood who she liked.The main problem I had with this drama is that a lot of things are incoherent. From one episode to the other a character changes totally: for example He-ra wanting to ruin her friend and suddenly remembering their friendship in another episode . At the end It seems like she totally forgot that she liked Ri-an and that was she was doing all of that. And don't even get me started on the last episode: Ri-an magically realized( just because jae-i asked)that he should apologize for bullying In-ha. There wasn't even a transition before this realization.Like everyone said the revenge plot was totally lost, at some point it was just Kang-ha running behind a girl that never really showed love to him.I really like the idea of everyone finishing happy, but the directors should have developed about how bullies got to realize that what they have done was bad. Everything was rushed at the end( last episode), but they still managed to make it long and boring.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Six only because of the ost's (that were way too repeated for such a short series) and the picture on my screen. People who have worked on sets, costumes, makeup, coloring, hair --- they know what they're doing.The writers, on the other hand, do not. We have five characters who are on the front, and yet, if you ask me who was the one I remember the most, I wouldn't be able to answer. Because it feels as if those with the script didn't have an idea of what they wanted characters to do, or maybe they just couldn't have the ""main"" love interest for the female lead to be bad.Which brings me to the point of characters. The female lead is... something. They did show the emotional abuse in the family pretty decently considering how small the number of episodes is, but maybe it's the reason why she fells so weak. Abused character who rebels against their own abusive parents and siblings? I'm seated, go on! Character who gets to discover themselves outside of their trauma and learn how to love the world? Great, give me move!.. But not her. She starts the show by walking from the replica of her father just younger, takes a few steps, falls in love with the male lead, doesn't want to come back to the already mentioned replica... and in the end comes back to the already mentioned replica just to make the full circle. The girl is... something. Genuinely. She doesn't grow, she decides that someone who is the leader of a bully gang in the school deserves protection and is worth fighting for. Her friendship with Hera is also something. Everything about her is something.The male lead is... fine, I guess? He's righteous, witty, smart... or so it seemed in the first episodes. Because the actual revenge plan he came up with looks ridiculous, to say the least, and that it works as well is even more hilarious. The fact that he came up with in the last two or three episodes is also interesting, as if the writers remembered they had to have a storyline that included revenge in it.Rian, the main bully and the ""main"" love interest... Oh dear. I don't mind having characters be redeemable. Nor do I mind characters who are obvious villains and have sad/tragic storyline. I'm all in because a good backstory makes the character more believable. It makes them them, it show us why they're the way they're now... but did I hate him lol. We had a great course with him in the first episodes, he's ruthless, he doesn't have any limits, he's powerful and he knows it, he uses it to his advantage. And this guy who beats people left and right, who threatens his own ex-girlfriend to use whatever it will take for him to get to know the truth she doesn't trust him with, becomes a crybaby? All of a sudden, he has a cold mother who doesn't pay him any attention and he's sad about it. And all of a sudden, he becomes a good guy who doesn't bully anymore, he just cries on female lead's shoulder constantly. And all of a sudden, we should sympathise with him because he wanted to be a father. What type of parent someone like him would become at the age of sixteen or whatever? No thought.Hera is the only one I genuinely enjoyed watching. Not because of the character, no. Because of the actress who was good in the role; her character could be a lot. There were so many possibilities with her, and yet writers decided to give her one arc to make her a better person... just for her to come back where she was in episode one.The fifth guy who sleeps with his teacher? I can not remember him. Did he have a story in the stories? I don't know. I never skipped his scenes and yet I can only remember that he's in love with Hera. That's all.Overall, the show feels like a Gossip Girl wannabe. Not the original one --- the reboot one that got cancelled a year or two ago. Beautiful but pointless, the show that could be so much and yet became nothing. And just like with the GG, so much hype and all for nothing.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

It was hard to connect with their motivations or struggles. I honestly didn't feel a thing about their suffering.The romantic subplot felt forced and underdeveloped. The chemistry between the leads just wasn't there.The revenge plot followed a familiar pattern with no real twists or surprises. There was nothing special about the story.One of the main thing I failed to connect with the show was I just could not relate to any of it. The whole plot was so unrealistic.

However, this was extremely underwhelming and unsatisfying. If you like watching bullying shows with little to no consequence for the bullys - this is for you. Was highly upset that they were also romanticizing a very toxic and abusive relationship. Very bland romance, no moments of justice and no character development.

(Elite only season 1 though)
Those series had us so totaslly invested in them.This one however was nothing like them.The suspense was useless.The relations were rubbish.The girl - apart from being expressionless was way too thin too.The guy - even though I liked him in King the land - was not likable at all in this one.The side actors - the 2 friends - though the acting was good - but again - NOT LIKABLE.How do u watch a series in which no one is to like.The principle.

tt27763561,"Good thing this series as only 7 episodes. A scholarship kid infiltrates an elite school to avenge his brother's death. There isn't a lot of story and they were resorting to repeats to fill in the gaps. There was a sombre sanctimonious tone that weighed down the show. Some humor would have helped along the way to balance the bullying. Takes itself too seriously. Also the characters are too one dimensional. Rich kids are bad, poor kids are good. Adults are all morally bankrupt and wrong. As a result there is no emotional connection with any of the characters which is unusual for K dramas. Most makjang soaps and family dramas have more of an immediate connection with the characters that keeps you glued to the screen. Even Gossip Girl initially had humor and endearing characters that made it engaging. Maybe because of the shallowness of Hierarchy the show is a relaxing undemanding watch and so it proved to be a big hit globally.The production is quite glossy with slick photography and lots of fancy cars. The school building looked anything but.Leading actress Roh Jeong-Eui is very pretty here. She has lost a shocking amount of weight from her previous roles in 18 Again and Kill It. Almost unrecognizable. She plays this unhappy looking person for most of the show with occasional flashbacks of laughter. Kim Jae Won as her love interest played the young version of a character in Our Blues. He tries hard to do the rich kid but somehow he isn't that believable. He might have been better as the scholarship kid. If you compare to Lee Min Ho in Inheritors you will see there is a quality missing. In fact the cast does suffer in comparison to Inheritors where the charisma of the stars just spoke for themselves. The supporting cast Ji Hye Won and Lee Won Jung are not quite attractive enough for this kind of glossy show. The older generation are well cast. Yoon Se Ah is a welcome presence as the mother of the rich guy. The scholarship student played by Lee Chae Min looks a bit like an actor Cha Hak Yeon who played an evil guy in another series so it's hard to be on his side. Somehow didn't sympathize with his character. Mostly the writer's fault.The conclusion was fairly complete by K drama standards. Too many tears. The fact is the two rich leads weren't really that bad so all their apologizing felt a bit off. After all they didn't actually case the death. It wasn't a rich person at all who killed him. At the end there is an epilogue that paves the way for season 2 but frankly I don't think I would be interested in another season of this miserable lot. This show is no Inheritors for sure and that's not saying much.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

Even though I didn't enjoy the show doesn't mean you will too. It might be your niche. Overall I felt as it was too much romance and not enough satisfying revenge scenes. Or the main lead going up against the bullies and having a proper back and fourth. It felt far from what the trailer was portrying. It made it seem it was going to be a good revenge plot but i guess it was a romance from the get go as thay is what the genre said on netflix and google.

How could Jae-I become so cold in a short of time? How could her best friend since childhood become so rude, betray her, become an enemy, and then become fren again with her? That Woojin guy, why can't he tell He-ra that he likes her so that He-ra would give up on Ri-an? What happened with Jae-I's mom that made her father so angry?So many questions cos not logical.

It offers numerous lessons, delving into human psychology and nature, as well as philosophical ideas like democracy, communism, socialism, dictatorship, and utilitarianism. The watchers monitoring through CCTV cameras in the drama could represent the elite globalists at the top of the capitalist pyramid, or they could symbolize us. After all, most of us likely enjoyed the show as mere spectators rather than feeling disturbed by it. Still, I always like and want to support this style of drama. That's why I believe it deserves at least an 8 out of 10. This drama had too many of his monologues and it was a bit annoying, so I deducted 1 star.P. S. While watching Squid Game, I couldn't help but notice the irony that the creators and investors of ""The 8 Show,"" including Netflix, are likely not members of the ordinary working class.

I like the part that the more ""sick"" the character is , the higher level they live in.Level 5 looks super kind to others but she have no logical thinking which make thing even worse than being bad.Level 3&4 is in the middle, these are the majority of the people, ordinary .Level 7 are super smart, smart enough to work for the ""level8"" people, even they might be kind, they have to protect themselves before saving others.Level 2 are those people who have high sense of justice. But they are too dumb to protect themselves. That's why bad thing always happens to good people.The 3 points I Deducted from the setting of the show.

Each episode is filled with very interesting and brilliant ideas. The structure of the show is very thought-out. The acting is amazing. The cinematography and music are also perfect. However, the best part of the show is in the message. Behind its ruthless depiction of the

Entire series does have only 8 characters. Definitely does offer lots of intense emotions, thrill, excitement, frustration n keeps you completely hooked up. Though starts on lines of innocence, it ends up getting very violent. If you are only into very sober series, avoid it but if you know what exactly a dark series n like them, then definitely must watch on those terms.

The violence sometimes devolves briefly into overt gore, though is offset with the dark and slapstick humor which gives this series a life of its own.The acting and English voices were both very good. Obviously the budget wasn't huge, with nearly all of the season taking place in a single building, and with a cast of 8 characters. But the set and the filming were both excellent, and the script was pretty brilliant, including in briskly moving along the plot.The plot twists kept coming, and were pretty inventive even when the general progression of events could be guessed at.

The setting and metaphors, as well as the commentary on how society works, are perfect. The out-of-touch ""elite"" girl is annoyingly insufferable.One thing, though, is that I feel like things got a bit too extreme toward the last two episodes. I'm not saying it's impossible for humans to be cruel in the pursuit of money-people have literally killed for money in real life. But for the last two episodes, even though such extreme actions are possible, when it went there so abruptly in the show, it just broke the immersion and suspension of disbelief and make the show felt unsettlingly too weird to watch.Still, this is a highly recommended show to watch.

I can see the similarities with the movie ""The Platform"" and series ""The Squidgame"", but there are still some original thoughts behind it too.The references about the society and the capitalism made depth to the series' plot, but characters poor choices, unnecessary violent scenes and torture part made me fast forward a few parts from the series. Especially the torture scene made me feel sick and in my opinion, it kept going too long too keep me interested in the series. It made me forget all the depth and the potential in the show and I fast forwarded to the end just to see how it ends.I think that the potential was wasted many times during the show. The characters and the acting was good, but in some point it was the same things all over again - upper floors against the lower floors. The graphic scenes seemed to be there just to shock you - there was no deeper meaning or story behind it.From the episode 3 or 4, the writer seemed to take all the easy roads to keep the story going. If only the writer was able to keep the original thought alive and the deep references about the society through the whole show, we would have a masterpiece in our hands.If there would be season 2 (which the ending scene might be promising), I'm not sure if I would watch it. The ending was not as deep as the great beginning would have deserved, so I'm not sure if the series has anything else to offer for season 2 since the original idea was already lost during the episodes 3, 4 and 5.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

The plot director delivers from several point of views of the cast but strongly wanted to show up the poor ones part. There is a classification of privileged and unprivileged where the privileged labours the others and when revolution happens the the table turns. Since there are no other characters available on the plot, the story and scenes stick on within the same faces and tend to bore in middle.If you watch the play from the unprivileged side, director wins and if you watch neutral, you are working the master and to share my experience - I went cruel and slightly supported the privileged side...",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

tt30423279,"""The 8 Show"" on Netflix starts off with great promise but ultimately disappoints. The first episode reels you into the realities of life with a compelling narrative that hooks you instantly. It sets a high bar, making you eager for more. The second episode builds on this by exploring a fantasy of immense wealth, sparking dreams of how such riches could solve one's problems. The third episode introduces the intricacies and wit of the characters, adding depth and complexity that keeps you engaged.However, by the fourth episode, the show begins to falter. The characters start making irrational decisions that undermine the story's credibility. This shift is jarring, considering the initial promise of a smart, well-crafted narrative. Despite my growing frustration, I gave the fifth episode a chance, hoping it would redeem the show. Unfortunately, it didn't. The plot continued to unravel, and the characters' actions remained inconsistent and poorly justified.I had high hopes for ""The 8 Show"" because the beginning hinted at a series with substantial wit and logical sense. The early episodes suggested a thought-provoking storyline with clever characters, but these elements quickly dissolved as the show progressed. The initial intrigue and promise faded, leaving behind a series that struggled to maintain its early momentum and coherence.Ultimately, I decided it was not worth continuing. The potential for a great show was there, but it was squandered by a lack of consistent character development and logical storytelling. I wish the series had stayed true to the sharp wit and logical foundation it initially presented.

Poor writing at this part, I guess.From the 3rd episode onwards all focus was on the time they could be there.

Actually, there were a lot of shocking scenes, but those were the result of human cruelty rather than scenes specifically designed to result in a bloodbath.That said, the drama has some merits, yes, but fails to have a smooth development, even giving a proper conclusion and explanation to the whole ordeal.

But some things were a bit stupid but if people realized why because the people in there went crazy at one point you cant think straight to much going on in your head and take revenge or beating someone up is not the smartest way of solving things, they were multiple people all diffrent thinking and the ideas they had were mostly diffrent but some were close so they took the closest things people thought and went with it that was at the start but if you stay there more the more your thoughts go crazy yk this made them think different more hostile because at the start they were all citizens and tried to solve things a civilized way the only way they knew but later on when the mind is going a diffrent way you will think more about the whole people and not only if you fit in the standard the whole show was not only to show the different classes and that if you are a low class worker there is no chance for going up but also to show how the human mind works and how the different thinking people and people with different mental states are no one is like the other and never will be everyone had their episode because to show this, the people saying that the unlogical things they did was ""stupid"" are the ones that mostly write raigbait or think they are the smartest in the room. This was an incredible show i loved everything the drama humor and the twists props to whoever came up with this.

tt30423279,"I really wasn't sure what to rate this. Honestly, truly, I could pick any number on the ratings spectrum and make an argument for it.Don't know if there's enough shows in the 'trapped and desperate people doing things for money' genre for The 8 Game to rehash tropes, but it somehow does. That being said, it IS inventive in different ways, and keeps the viewer engaged.I could predict about 60% of the plot, which is much less than most, so kudos for that. Korean films and shows can really throw some curve balls with their depravity and plot twists. Might be a slightly different mentality from western culture, I'm not sure what it is, but it works. Train to Busan, I Saw the Devil, Oldboy, there's several gems in Korean cinematography. While I wouldn't place ""The 8 Show"" on the same shelf as these, it's a worthwhile endeavor that's very slippery to define.End of the day, am I glad I watched it? Yeah.

The viewers should get the idea of every eight person's behavior.The fantasy cartoon parts created to make the show cute, didn't suit it well, personally prefered to make the show as much realistic as possible.In conclusion,A good rollercoaster of excitement, no clue of what comes next.Spoiler: Real life can be much more cruel.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"I am gonna be honest I didn't liked the show infact I hated it ! This show seriously tests your patience and specially after Episode 4. First and foremost it had irritating characters (maybe except Floor 2 girl because she atleast was a character who had a spine) and specially Floor 8 was the worst like that evil character needed to die in this show that too in a painful manner but instead the makers made sure that Floor 8 does not even get a scratch ! This show fails at giving you a satisfying revenge on the bad guys because the writers made the good guys dumb! The creators wanted to make ""an intellectual show"" but what they produced was ""an idiotic show""! The good guys were seriously getting tortured throughout the show but once they get free and capture the bad guys they don't try to extract revenge on them like it's so absurd!! Like seriously these guys tortured the hell out of you and you guys are letting them go so easily only for the bad guys to once again recapture the good guys and torture them more!! This show is absurd!! The makers seems to be quiet sadistic regarding the treatment of the good guys , this show's name should have been ""The Torture Show"" as it had torture scenes just for the sake of it which didn't had much purpose in the show. The show had logical loopholes as well like when the good guys decided to end the show by running out of time then why didn't they do it by buying some expensive stuff through time counter in the hall and it could have finished it on the spot! Plus the good guys were 3 males and 2 females but they couldn't overpower the bad guys which had 1 male and 2 females like are you kidding me!!! And while the bad guys had one baseball bat and a tazer but still they could have been defeated as the tazer take time to reload and the guy could have been ambushed by atleast 3 guys!!! The characters are such morons that when Floor 4 was being a slave for Floor 8 , she herself could have overpowered Floor 8 who is not some kind of a fighter but she later on gets the idea to knock her out by using her golf staff like why didn't she used it before?? The makers need to understand that nhilism does not mean reality , they are trying to be too negative about the world. Everything was just unsatisfying about this show specially the ending where they are hosting Floor 1 guy's funeral and they tried to invite the bad guys as well who tortured them like are you guys out of your mind!! These guys should be going after them with a chainsaw and make them pay but no our good guys are so good that they wanna ""make up"" with them!!!

Which nowadays is rare, as the industry is only using the same repetitive formula to try to squish all the series the major quantity of seasons as possible.I came thinking that would be a goofy show or reality and ended with one of the great surprises of the year.You will hate some of the decisions and think at some points why they are doing this? It is always important to understand that the 8 people selected are not your regular people on society, they are people crushed with their life at the edge before being selected to the show... that explains a lot about why they take some outrageous decisions, they were broken before getting in the show, what you would expect after some days within the show?",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,Well I watched the first episode. Thus far it seems like an odd show. I have to say in Asian cultures people are way to polite. That greedy idiot girl if rules didn't exist as this show seems like they don't. Well she would have been beaten. She seems like she will cause a ton of issues and that's what the show people want. What I do t understand is why not beat her and take her room key. What is stopping them from taking a key? I didn't see a single rule that said you are forced to stay in the room you selected. This again is why I think certain cultures think outside the box while others stay in it. Sorry but I would have taken her key and tied her up and tossed her in room 1. Made the guy in room one go to 2. Only because he cant walk. Although I would give him 8 if he was able to make it. But yeah that one girl needs to be dealt with. Our society lets to many idiots run around and say whatever they want on social media like MTG the troll. As humans we should value education and people who are smart. But instead we seem to value idiots on Tiktok or whatever. This show seems fun and I hope the next episodes are good. Hopefully they do something about the idiot spoiled brat. I know I personally would tie her up and make it so she doesn't cause any issues. Because we all know she is going to be a pain in everyone's butt. I would definitely buy a crowbar for protection. The rule said until someone died not if someone has a broken arm or leg.Okay below this is give aways. So episode 5 and 6 are nuts. First off in this situation I would have already had weapons. However the broken phone can become a shiv. The phone cord a weapon as well. The pee and poo weapons. Pens and pencils are weapons. Seriously what is with these people. Also the horrible girl and guy break their knee caps. Simple. Or at the very least buy 3 handcuffs per person. Why? One for the feet and one for the hands and one to put both feet and hands together. Hog tie them. They do not deserve to be shown kindness. That one older lady is going to mess everything up with her insanity and seeing people that aren't their. She is going to get someone killed I know it. Because she will let someone free and that person will hurt a ton of people. The guy floor 6 and girl floor 8 are psychopaths. Seriously how has no one thought of first buying food with floor 8s money. Also taking their cards and switching rooms. The rules never said you had to stay in the room you selected. So toss floor 8 and 6 into 1 and 2 and give 1 floor 8 and 2 floor 6. That would be the best thing for the show. But it's a Korean show so I am guessing floor 6 will get free and end someone and really hurt others. Because Korean shows don't show fantasies. They show reality. Like how most people sheep and submissive. They will do anything and be okay with it.This show is really good. It pisses me off and makes me mad. Because I feel for the lower floors. I was t them to take out those who hurt them. But they are such subs and wimps. But then again it's probably why they are in this situation. But seriously they need to grow a pair. At the very least put all the poop and pee in their rooms. And use their money to buy food and clean clothes and whatnot. I mean seriously they asked floor 8 if it is okay to spend some money on an item. Really? You ask the person who started the torture. If this isn't a show about Asian society. I don't know what is.,neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"This definitely kept my interest but it was very frustrating to watch at times. Got to a point where the only reason I was watching was to see the bottom people get back at the top. There are some major plot holes like why when the bottom people took over did they not just run out the time on the clock with purchases. Or why did they not buy weapons to protect themselves like the others had. They could have bought weapons to protect themselves and run out the time lol. There were several times I wanted to just stop watching the show but didn't in hopes of a satisfactory ending. That didn't happen. Lots of violence for people who enjoy violent nonsense. Great if you're a sadist but there were parts I had to fast forwarded through. How did number 6 get his bat back? They really didn't take that, and the taser? Number 8 was frustratingly awful. I'm sure making the person in the most powerful position a total psychopath felt like entertainment value but again, makes it a harder watch at times. 2 was the only character worth liking. When I first started this I was telling my boyfriend he needed to check it out, not sure it's worth recommending anymore. Just so annoyed by the clear plot hole of the time not being run out when were trying to wait time out. So ridiculous. Totally cynical. Glad it's over. I would not compare it to Squid Games or the Platform.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"I want to support the progress of Asian content as much as possible, but I cannot recommend this show for the sheer frustration is causes.This promises a gripping tale of survival in a high-rise building, but it quickly devolves into a frustrating experience filled with numerous plot holes and implausible scenarios. Despite its initial intriguing setup, the series leaves much to be desired in terms of coherence and logical storytelling.From the outset, one of the most glaring issues is the logistical implausibility surrounding the 8th floor. The premise suggests that all furniture and fixtures must be transported through a single chute. However, the apartments are inexplicably furnished with large, cumbersome items such as sofas, wardrobes, and kitchen appliances. How these items were maneuvered through the chute and/or installed is never explained, leaving a significant hole in the narrative.Another perplexing aspect of the show is the characters' baffling inaction regarding the main lobby phone. There were many things that reasonable people would have used the phone for that I can't exhaustively get into, but at a certain point, they wanted to run down the clock, like ASAP. They could have bought stuff to run it down, but chose to just let it run down overnight. Why? This passive approach feels both unrealistic and frustrating, undermining the tension and urgency that should drive a survival narrative. Viewers are left wondering why the characters, portrayed as reasonably intelligent, did not take more proactive approach.The show also suffers from several implausible and poorly executed plot points. One particularly egregious example is the scene where a character wakes up to discover her teeth have been removed without her noticing. The process of extracting teeth is inherently painful and bloody, making it impossible for such an act to occur without waking the victim. Similarly, another character has his toenails removed without screaming, an equally improbable scenario given the excruciating pain involved. These scenes stretch believability to its breaking point, further eroding the show's credibility.Compounding these issues is the question of how the perpetrator managed to reach both victims without being noticed. The show establishes that the elevator is noisy and noticeable, and the characters would have spotted anyone using the stairs. Yet, the perpetrator somehow manages to move undetected. This inconsistency is never addressed, adding another layer of frustration for viewers trying to make sense of the plot.Beyond these logistical and narrative flaws, the creator seems overly focused on infuriating viewers with the depiction of social injustice and the arbitrary nature of privilege. While exploring themes of class and privilege is common in Korean dramas, this show leans excessively into suffering and anguish without offering proper resolution or retribution. The result is a story that feels more like a series of injustices designed to frustrate rather than engage the audience.Moreover, the show employs a tired trope where the protagonist, on the brink of achieving their revenge, is rendered impotent by a sudden moral epiphany or a desire to retain their humanity-qualities that their abusers have already stripped from them. This trope not only feels cliched but also robs the story of a satisfying resolution. Instead of seeing the protagonist rise above their tormentors, viewers are left with a sense of unfinished business and unfulfilled justice.In conclusion, this show falls far short of its potential. The numerous plot holes, logistical implausibilities, and frustrating narrative choices make it a difficult watch. While it aims to comment on social issues, its execution is flawed, leaving viewers more exasperated than enlightened. Unless you enjoy being frustrated by illogical storytelling and unresolved suffering, this series is not worth the anguish.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"It's like ""The Platform"" and ""Squid Game"" had a baby-a baby that had every chance to become great, but then started doing hard drugs, became mentally challenged, and jumped off a bridge. Sadly, the bridge wasn't high enough, so now it's just a mutant with no functional cells trying to swim to shore but can't, slowly drowning in the shallow river it jumped into.Seriously though, they could have made it so easy for themselves. Having sex gives 70 hours? And they just do it once? And how about everyone takes care of their own poop? And when they wanted it to end while the bad guys are tied up, why not order a bunch of luxury stuff to lose the remaining time?And don't get me started on the main guy. I've rarely seen a show with such an unlikeable main character. Why am I supposed to root for this dumb, spineless loser?Also, in the end, some dude who can barely walk balances over a rope and starts using it as a trampoline to jump like 20 meters up.

tt30423279,"A dark comedy or satire with the unique themes present in this show needs to have at least semi-relatable characters that have basic common sense. They don't have to be the most rational or logical individuals, but the audience should at least feel some sort of emotional connection with them in order to suspend their disbelief.The 8 Show faces a significant challenge here, and unfortunately I think the approach they went with is far too comical, and falls significantly short of quality dark comedy as a result. The contestants are exaggerated caricatures as opposed to relatable humans, and the plot depends far too much on ridiculous decisions and unbelievable traits to progress through a runtime that is about 2 hours too long.I really wanted to like it as I'm a huge fan of satire, especially of the dark variety.

If you have a problem with the toilet wast in the rooms, why don't you order a toilet that everybody can us in the common room and store the wast there? It's clear that using violence is not a problem for some of the characters, so why is nobody just taking the room key from the psychopath woman on floor 8 and do as they please with the room and the food that gets delivered to this room first? This kind of questions I had like every 5 minutes while watching.

some of them so badly wanted to end the show. When it is up to 9 hours left, then something happen and added up the time, they could have just buy stuffs from the main hall to end the time. But what they did? They add unnecessary drama to prolong it.

This show started off intriguing...and once I grasped the gist, which didn't take long, I was interested to see how these characters would choose to extend their time in the game and increase their winnings. I knew violence would begin, but after it started the show quickly spiraled downward into stupidity.First of all the characters really had no depth, and the decisions they made were just absolutely ridiculous. I get the metophorical symbolism with the hierarchy of the floors, but they should've made better decisions with the script.There were a ton of plot holes too.The greatest of all my frustrations with the show was why these characters (with the exception of two) decided to remain in their sweaty dirty piss and blood stained outfits for the entire time (which was months). While the cost of a new outfit was probably a lot, they all could've easily done this. Especially when they began pissing themselves from being tased, they remained in the outfits!The dumb decisions made were just astronomical but that one above all just baffled me.Also one cinematic plot hole that made no sense...none of the men grew any facial hair the entire time.

Right off the start it was clear that the top floors are going to bully the bottom ones, and it just happened to be that the most psychotic ones were at the top and got all the power. It was still, pretty interesting to watch the bottom floors fighting for some kind of ""justice"", but then, the creators had a chance to make something good, and they missed it. They were mistaken into thinking that the violence and the injustice should get more and more extreme to keep things interesting.. so they simply decided to ruin things and make the top floor a ""smiling dictator"". She would devour anything and anyone in her path for her own joy and they had a chance to at least give us some sort of satisfaction.. by finally tasing her.. but nope.

tt30423279,"I went into this with an open mind, given its interesting premise, however wish I'd have spent my time doing something else.The character are very one dimensional, one aspect that was really missing was further development, what their motivations are and how they ended up the way they are. You see small snippets of their background but never enough to actually get to know the character, you can describe every character using two personality traits, there's no further depth to them.This would have worked a lot better as a long movie, or 4 episodes max. The first few episodes are okay but these even suffer from drawn out scenes which feel like filler, the last two episodes were mostly filler, with one episode featuring flashing lights for the majority of the episode - perhaps an artistic choice to make the viewer suffer in line with the characters, but for me this episode was just unwatchable and I fast forwarded through it.Back to my issue with the length - 8 episodes were likely just picked to match the name of the show but it feels as though they absolutely didn't have enough content.There are weird special effects thrown in which feel really out of place, are quite poor and feel like they go on forever, again, in an attempt to fill 8 episodes. It appears as 'trying too hard' to be artsy.Lots of over the top violence, which realistically should have led to multiple deaths early on, but all characters appear to be made of rubber, and other than sfx make up seem to make a full recovery just a few scenes later. Genuinely, almost all characters should have died or suffered extensive brain damage with the amount of blows that are dealt in this show. I'm not usually fussy about realism, but it gets a bit ridiculous when it's the same thing over and over.It would have been nice to see an approach where manipulation and mind games could ply a larger part in defining hierarchy, however, there is only one character that truly engages in this.One of my pet peeves is when a character makes a ridiculously stupid decision (without a background or personal motive), which this of course features.In terms of the positives it has an interesting premise, is quite good at making you side with the protagonist, and does somehow compel you to watch to the end in case something interesting may actually happen.

However, the script got worse and worse with many plot holes. The production also looked much lower budget than Squid Game, because the story just cycled between being in one room and outside that same room. There were no other settings besides brief flashbacks to the past. The games were very basic, played among themselves without any investment in creating new sets or scenes.

for the sake of money, but not in a boring way. It doesn't hold attention, and I rewound most of the series to get to the end faster. I cannot comment on the acting because the series is not in my native language, but I can comment on the series itself.

tt30423279,"I never write reviews and i don't watch netflix shows or any shows too often because for me it honestly seems like a waste of time. I got on netflix because i was lost this morning with what i wanted to do today (I had too much free time) And decided to make this stupid decision to watch this show because it seemed cool. First off when 3rd floor wanted to jump off the bridge i already can't remember why - he was depressed because of debt and he had these 2 bullies chasing him at the start- who tf are they, is one of these bullies later in the program, or something? Or they're just not really relevant? Nvm about that, after being in that long car after bring sent the money i realized this is a show like squid game. He entered the hall, chose a card... honestly it was kind of cool. Fast forward to episode 5 alot of things didn't make any sense lmao. In the rule book it was mentioned that it is not allowed for the characters to hang out outside after midnight but it literally seemed like that 20 precent of the time when floor 3 and floor 7 were smoking it seemed like it passed midnight and literally all the other times when other characters hanged out outside, seemed like they broke that rule but idk. It just made me confused.The main character is so forgetable, i literally forgot he existed into episode 6, i think they needed to provide more of what he thought and his prespective to everything thats going on from his prespective, into the later episodes we just viewed the show from a general prespective and not 3rd floor's prespective which literall just kinda made me forget about the main character.I hate the idea that floor 3 has to be so weak and ""UHUUHUH IM SCARED UHUHH"" please stop😭.it's literally annoying that they have to make him so weak, it's not cool netflix, you can make him change his personality, let him beat 8 floor after she literally abused them for so long, literally let the character change. Also so much violence for literally no reason. I don't know how much can 2nd floor get beat up- how doesnt she get brain damage, the hell? She got beat up by 6th floor like 10 times throughout this whole show. The torture of the characters in the later episodes were hard to watch. I love violence in these kind of shows but in this it was just unnecessary.. I just kept watching through that because i thought something would get better but it didn't. I'm sorry that i'm writing this review in a bad way but i'm just fed up, there's so many concepts in this show so many stuff... But i think the main annoying thing about the show is that nothing is really rewarding, i'm sure most of the viewers wanted to see 8floor getting beatup but at the end we just see her getting jailed? Like we didnt even see her getting jailed they just said she's in prision? Also the filming when 2nd floor and one of the other girls kissed each other that was unnecessary it seemed like high schoolers recorded that scene of craziness.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"Honestly the review title says it all.Korea Netflix has decided now is the time to give a less violent version of Kaiji and Squid Games (which is a knock off of Kaiji). The premise is that a corporation lures poor people to undertake inhumane games for the sake of entertainment. Fake environment with stairs. Yawn. That's already been done.The characters are not real people but caricatures of ""rough buff guy"", ""nerdy smart guy"", ""dumb but likable protagonist"", ""motherly middle aged woman"", ""edgy woman with a chip on her shoulder"", ""kiss the feet of whoever in on top girl"", ""person with a disability whose entire personality is based on their disability (seems ableist actually) rather showcasing them as a complex human"", and ""quirky cute girl who turns out to be mean"". These paper characters are unfortunately common tropes you see in K-dramas, but you get the idea.Instead of interesting human-led drama you just get these cardboard facades playing into their personalities to give you plot twists that can be predicted from episode 1, and an ending that not only dis-serves the disabled character and refuses him to contribute to the story in a meaningful way other than using his disability and ending as a way to gain emotional sympathy. In a way it's infantilizing.This was marked as a dark comedy by Netflix and I don't think my mouth moved except when yawning or coughing. Yes, seriously.Instead of investing in good shows, Netflix continues to put out 90% barely watchable content in hopes it tides you over until they release the shows they actually invest their money and good writers in.This show is not worth your time.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"As other reviewers have said, this series feels very inspired by both Squid Games and The Platform. There's absolutely no way to watch this and not be reminded of those, if you have seen the other two before watching. It's not just a mash up of the two though - it has its own unique premise and plot, so definitely not a rip off but definitely still inspired by.Anyways, to talk about THIS show - it was decent. I didn't finish it feeling like I wasted my time. It kept me intrigued enough to binge the 8 episodes. But I also have no hunger for a season two (which is slightly odd for me for a show that kept me intrigued enough to binge). It didn't provide any moment where I ever went ""OH WOOOOOW I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT"", it didn't change my perspective on anything, it didn't leave me with any sort of... answers OR questions. My favourite shows are the ones that DO those things - the shows where I FEEL different after watching or I THINK about things differently after watching. Those are the shows I think about years later and keep rewatching (Squid Games and The Platform both achieved that for me). This was an entertaining, quality show, but it does not join THAT list. It was a good way to spend a rainy day with a coffee and a blanket, but overall I will have forgotten it in a few months.But, if you like these kinds of shows/movies it's definitely worth checking out if you've got nothing better on your watchlist!",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"Once you watch squid game, You are never gonna like this show. The storyline, the presentation is so poor, and it is so Stretched, I felt like when this show will be ending. I watched this show at a speed of 1.5.They were just continuously showing how the upper floors are cruel and lower floors are struggling or in pain. So basically they wanted to show the capitalism in society and how the people who has money or power, dominate the people who are poor or does not have powers. But I personally did not like the show. I Was not at all hooked with the show.Further, people who had either no money or has lost fame or is losing in the business, they were selected for the show. The storyline is only that there are people who wanted to see some entertaining show, so these people who are players are given time based on the Fact that they can entertain the people watching the show. But there was no connection who are watching the shows and a basis behind it. They could have connected the dots in a better way.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"The idea fits well within the genre - the concept is very good - and the societal critique well intended. They covered a lot of topics about how our society works and all the misery led by it. Generally; the messages conveyed by this piece are great.Unfortunately, the series declined in quality and suspense with every episode and the characters stayed rather shallow.Random things that seem to not exist in this universe:
-> Infections
-> Force trauma, hematoma
-> Poisoning (from the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide coming from the feces for example)
-> Internal bleeding, brain injury
-> thrombosis
-> exposure keratopathy (eyes drying out from the torture device)
etc.While it is obvious that the writers want to reflect real world problems with this series, they should have done more to preserve some sense of logic and incorporate ways to tackle the logic holes while still maintaining the rules of the show.The characters are incredibly stupid at times and also rather predictable - it would be fine if they were consistently like this. But the writing made them switch between semi clever and intellectually impaired all the time.This makes the whole series just frustrating to watch. Because you'll already know what's gonna happen.Anyway - some thoughts about the floors:1 - Caricature of the non-abled people in our society. One of the better characters were it not for his cliché backstory (sick child, needs money).2 - Is she supposed to depict the negative sides of communism?3 - Rarely witnessed an MC with this little depth. His introduction in ep1 was interesting (though never catched back upon again) - but every time he opens his mouth it's just dry air (except for ep8).4 - Is she supposed to depict a child? Otherwise I can't explain myself the actress' acting. But then again it doesn't match with what the character is doing. All in all just unbelievable portrayal of a person - no person is actually like this. And I'm aware of the cultural differences between SK and me (central europe), but I've been watching south east asian TV for over a decade now and still.5 - Don't get me started, this review would never end. Fun fact; her backstory doesn't even work; you can't just sell real estate property that belongs to your husband without his involvement.6 - Unhinged violence; I guess every series needs a cliché gangster.7 - Best character together with 1 and 2; but still would have wished for a little more depth. His very short backstory was intriguing though!8 - Unrealistically annoying. She doesn't posess fear or any form of common sense it seems. A person like this wouldn't even have survived before the start of the series. She does nothing to secure her position at floor 8 and just got by with luck (if any of the other characters were a bit smarter, she'd have lost her place in the first episode already). But I guess this is the way she was intended. She is probably written like this to mirror the societal structure that protects her and they want to show that she doesn't care about the usual status symbols. And in that sense I guess it can work?Good stuff:
-> the 1 billion floor switch was a good twist
-> the set (while getting boring after several episodes) had a nice design
-> combining the premise of 'the floor' with other survival game genre tropes worked well
-> the cinematography was pleasantly good (the style, colors, atmosphere, camera work etc.)
-> the ending (floor 1's performance and the symbolism) was very goodEnding episodes nonsense:
In ep7; why would floor 4 and 5 agree to setup a sleep deprivation torture? Their characters before were naive but not violent. They wanted the show to end as well - it makes absolutely 0 sense that this was happening. And this is ignoring that the whole torture scene wouldn't work by 'maintaining bodily functions' - humans die after several days of no sleep and their vision would be impaired without proper hydration of the eyes.Also, why would 4 and 5 need to untie the others to overthrow 8? Just take her gun away when she's not looking and you can forget that whole plot.Also if they want the time to run out, they could just buy stuff at the market place. Anyway.I could talk forever about the things that don't make sense ... especially as the series goes on ... but let's end the review here. The concept is very good, nice symbolism and message, the first episode was catchy, generally an okay to good watch but it really fell off over time.Thanks for reading :)",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

It didn't share any lesson or message.The show was sad and had a lot of pointless harsh scenes.'Squid Game' had a story with a lesson and 'The Platform' had many moral messages. But this one didn't make me feel anything.At the end, I was just like, 'So what? Is that it?' No lessons? No messages? Nothing?I wouldn't suggest watching this. I wanted to like it, but after all the episodes, there was nothing.Anyway, these are just my thoughts. Check it out yourself, but you can't ignore that it's not great.

tt30423279,"The 8 Show started with an intriguing plot: Eight characters are invited to a game show. Each are given a floor in an artificial building to live in; the higher your floor, the more money and privilege you'll have. Now they have to survive while trying to entertain the show's viewers to keep the game going for as long as possible.The good: The characters start out likable with some fun personality; there's a bit of intrigue about their backgrounds, as each character was hand-selected and each episode starts with a character intro. There are moments of genuine humor. The first three episodes are captivating as we figure out the rules. The child-like and artificial set design is memorable.Unfortunately, the quality dips significantly after episode three. Despite early intriques, characters turn out very cliche. The game runs out of rules so the Show becomes about interpersonal drama; however, the characters are so illogical and unmotivated that their actions will frustrate you to the point of tearing your hair out.There's an obvious evocation of class hierarchy, but it's shallow. The show only wants to replicate the hierarchy and the violence within it. As a result, you're just watching unlikble people wallow in drama and misery, playing against their mutual interests, literally torturing each other, and trying to outdo each other's violence. All of this accumulates in an incredibly unsatisfying ending where one character just tells another what happened to the ""bad guy"". Literally- they met up, one character shows another a news article on their phone and described how the antagonist was in jail-- no flashback or anything. The show doesn't give us too many new or interesting to chew on- no catharsis, no revelation, no emotional reflections.Compare The 8 Show to Squid Game or Parasite, both of which evoke class struggle; unlike The 8 Show, they provide us with many points of reflections. Characters are so humanized that we root for them. They are given sensible motives that guide their decisions. The pain we see done unto them, a reflection of class violence, are gut punches. Both of these shows also contain much deeper dialogue and imagery that reveal the mechanisms of class hierarchy and capitalism.The 8 Show is also a critique of reality TVs as well as influencer culture-- demonstrating the dehumanization of struggling people having to fight over money for public consumption. The most interesting part of this metaphor can be found in the main villain, who sits at the top floor; she is an artist who sees the show as her stage to craft a masterpiece. I feel she represents the way artists also try to replicate and capitalize on representation of trauma for clout. Though, in away, this is a perfect critique of the Show, isn't it?",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

Mindless violence for NO REASON, which makes it so boring. The one 'good' twist is predictable as anything too.Snoozefest. The 3 stars was for the actors who I did enjoy.

tt30423279,"I wish I could give a positive review, and I almost did.But the middle was so bad, I just can't. Had to switch to watching on my laptop at some point just so I could watch at 1.5x speed.Good:
What is it with those Korean critiques of modern capitalism? The show has this Orwell novel feeling, however it doesn't deliver 100% on that. Not necessarily a bad thing - I would likely have been bored if it was just another retelling of Orwells work in disguise -, but at one point I was hoping for a 1984 plot point the show sadly didn't explore. I loved how different ideas of social structures were explored, but on the other hand it didn't feel like the ideas or problems themselves are anything new - just the presentation, but still fun.Bad:
There were points, especially around ep 4, that were hard to endure. In my mind moral injustice has to feel believable to have the right effect in a story, but at this point the story is at a logic low point.Overall: Actions are forgiven, injuries are only visual, and while the show claims characters minds are suffering, it can't be observed in their actions.Parts of the show felt like watching engagement farming ""rage-bait"" content on social media.The violence and suffering lacks a hierarchy, it's difficult to tell how impactful something is until the show comes around and plainly tells you, and characters go to horrible experiences so easily that it quickly becomes ineffective to spark interest in the viewer.I must point out, this dosen't apply to the whole show. Some plot points are great and intelligently deliver on the promise of social commentary. But most of it is not.Verdict:
So close to being a great, intelligent show. Maybe it's just too much to handle? This is a show most people will either hate or love. I wasn't immediately sure what side I am on but I noticed: I didn't gain any new perspective, I didn't think about the social dilemma but the story loop holes, and I almost quit midway and had to watch at 1.5x speed.

So they had the characters make as many dumb decisions as you can imagine. They are soooo many moments when you'll be asking ""Why are they doing this ??

All the criticism, the beautiful metaphors, the violence etc, everything had its place and its time and dosage in ""The Platform"" and ""El Hoyo"". Here in ""the 8 show"" it merely seemed like how absurd and nonsensical the producers were able to design the show.I only watched it until the end because of one reliable user review of this show that was written by 'wavey-lip' (thank you very much !!! @wavey-lip) where he pointed out that in episode 7 the viewer is tested regarding how much nonsense one could take.

At first, I am intrigued, initially comparing to ""The Squid Game"" but this show is supposed to be more than that, a philosophical commentary on our modern existence. It does achieve these philosophies in the first episode or so, making you ponder and decode the metaphors presented. Unfortunately, the execution of all this gets muddled by these rather one-dimensional characters. They are more like caricatures than real people who are going through struggles, pain, and suffering.

They must entertain the viewers, thereby earning more time to make more money. It is a neat concept but feels like an incomplete idea.The characters are not really given much backstory either, which is disappointing. Our protagonist, who is colloquially known to us as Third Floor is the only character whose backstory we kind of know about. He is not very likable, either. It would have been nice if the other characters were given more depth and equal screen time so the audience could choose who to root for.I cannot really recommend this show, however. It is very sadistic, as it aims to explore the limits of human depravity.

tt30423279,"Comparisons will inevitably be made to Squid Game.One of the reasons Squid Game endeared itself to audiences was that the atmosphere of twisted fantasy was enough to make you forget about the heartless violence. You also cared about the characters enough to continue watching. With The 8 Show, the sympathetic characters are at worst, spineless and passive. At best, they are overly contemplative and idealistic.So... did you finish? Did you get to episode 8? Well, now you have a decision. Do you tell your coworkers and/or friends that you didn't like it and risk being called a prudish puritan or do you conclude that this is ...provocative ...bold ...challenging art?If you're like me, you reflected on what you watched and realized that the thematic elements making up The 8 Show are laid on so thick, that even if you can stomach the depravity on display, you realize that you're being treated to what is essentially a grab of obvious source material: Big Brother, Clockwork Orange, Salo: 120 Days of Sodom, The Stanford Experiment.We're supposed to marvel at the sadism, contemplate the morality, be intrigued by the societal metaphors and finally, be terrified at the grotesque surreal spectacle of torture. But that only starts around episode 6. The first five episodes are entertaining and fun. We enjoy the character dynamics, become emotionally invested in the plot. Then things take a turn for the worse, both for the characters and for you as a viewer.

It wasn't a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I'm not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I'm in the 5th episode right now, and so far I've felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there's no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn't use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you'll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it's well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It's worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It's well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"When I heard of this Korean high school zombie series I was interested, despite the subject matter being done to death over the years. Then I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing. Having just finished up the show, I can confirm that this is one of the most entertaining shows out there, and far surpasses the likes of THE WALKING DEAD. The small scale works a treat and somehow they manage to eke out the momentum over the whole 12-episode arc. It never feels too small and it never feels dull, packed as it is with expertly directed action and tense mayhem. The Koreans excel in this one and I loved every minute of it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I'm for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just ""it started"". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just ""what""? So the teacher's son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I'm impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just ""burn them all""? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would've separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it's a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what's going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it's a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can't help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia's gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious ""half zombies"" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully's obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn't die anymore... and she couldn't do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It's like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn't terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren't actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series.

The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.,positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don't act accordingly to defend themselves?I've been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there's a trend where people don't do the right thing so they don't embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre.

tt14169960,"Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it's not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography.

tt14169960,"There is a lot to say about this zombie teenage drama.The zombie portion is done very well, the only reason I bumped it up to 7 stars instead of 6 is how all of the constituent parts come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts, but this series is not without its flaws.If you can appreciate good acting, a nice score, great cinematography, and a decent story (and love zombies) then this is for you.However, if you're a logically minded person then this will be a trial of frustration in which characters will continually make the worst decisions possible.Whatever you imagine you would do in the character's situation you can almost bet that they will go about things in the worst way imaginable. This is a compounding problem. There is no salvation from idiocy here, only bad decision after bad decision. This can be tolerated to an extent but the frustration only continues to rise.Despite this glaring problem, everything else balances it out. It's worth watching if only because the dumb decisions benefit from the suspension of disbelief. You will find yourself rooting for the cast and get caught up in their emotional drama. You will find both high points and low points worth celebrating and mourning, all of the braindead decision-making be damned, you'll still be forced to feel something.It's not the best zombie flick, but it's a damn good addition and a worthy addition to the Z-roster.

However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie.

They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let's stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let's stare.

Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok.

Some characters do things that don't make a lot of sense, like taking unnecessary risks or not helping other characters they like. The show also excessively wastes time on characters who do nothing in the grand scheme of things. One person essentially took like 2 hours of screen time in the first season, opened a door for the main group, and then left. While that gives the feeling that any character could die, it also makes it seem like only the core characters actually matter and that everyone will just vanish or die from the show. Not to mention that there is a character who could easily deal with many of the issues the main group faces and... just doesn't? Maybe they explain at some point why this girl doesn't use her unique abilities more... but it seems like most problems are easily solved by getting that girl to go do things for the group.

I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads.

Dialog is in Korean so let's leave that to the Korean speakers to decide if it's natural or not.Zombie fighting scenes are well-choreographed, entertaining and brutal but not gratuitously gory, the most fun part of the series. Main antagonist was given too little screen time (fighting scenes against villain too short, often ends abruptly).Plot is the weakest point. Plot holes plenty, including questionable character decisions (to put it mildly), unimpactful characters/storylines, plus the multiple story lines didn't really connect to each other or went anywhere, leaving many unresolved questions but probably banking on another season (the culture of always save some mysteries for new seasons instead of having an all-conclusive story).Occasionally force-feeds audience unnecessary expositions.Kudos for featuring real phone and computer UI instead of dummy OS interface to avoid lawsuits like other big titles.Netflix please don't cop out and try to revive fan-favourite characters just for the sake of fan service, be unapologetic and let them die.---All in all: worth a watch---",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

This could be a great show if the writers said what would I do in this situation instead of how can we throw in as many metaphors and quotes that now for some reason we have to analyze. Also, weren't those soldiers trained? How did they miss shooting him so badly that he was only hit randomly underwater? They should've lit him up profusely before he even touched the water.

When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes.

Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I'll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show's mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn't want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won't. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they're about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show's pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don't know Korea's standards but WOW everyone's so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. 💪🏻 Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"I'm not giving this a rating because I've only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they're twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly.

Of course, it would not be a young adult flick without love stories, friendship stories, bromance and .... bullying. You would expect that, wouldn't you?!One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.Worth watching 8/10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,When this first started I was excited and enjoyed it but as the episodes piled up I found the plot stale. This show acknowledges Zombies but yet doesn't follow any protocol of anyone in the show knowing what to do with zombies. Like no one is stabbing these zombies in the head for every attack. Some shots are head shots but they are few and far between. I mean they are stuck in situations and they could easily get out of the characters with stabbing objects just jabbed them in the head. Nope. Instead they just whack them all over and somehow these zombies just fall down. Plus these zombies are very easy to just throw and fight off without weapons. There needs to be more gore also. Like no limbs are being torn off by zombies or guts ripped out or even chunks being ripped out with their teeth. You also have character build up and creating a story and then they just get bit and sacrifice themselves to save the group. This happens like 5-6 times. You have a girls father trying to get to her to save her for 8 episodes just to have him show up and die 4 minutes later. Like why the build up. That was terrible. Built him up like he was gonna come in and save the day and be a badass but nope. Just shows up and opens a door and then walks 30 yards and just throws away all survival instinct he had the entire show and just dies. Towards the end of the series the characters make worse and worse decisions. Oh a herd of zombies are coming? We've been hiding and running the enter show but now let's be out in the street and fight them all. Literally have shovels and they aren't chopping off heads. Nah. Let's hit them in the arms and legs and back. Why not go into one of the 30 houses and hide and survive. Nope. Just a stupid battle to kill off another character. They also need Korean voice actors who were born and raised in the US and speak English bc these translators say stuff that makes no sense.,negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight.

Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren't all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn't eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it.

The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it's a mid tier apocalyptic show.The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one.

whenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there's enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show.

I know this is a fiction however the reason why I don't like the ending is because, in a fiction called Hunger Games: Catching Fire, no one would like to play the games for the 3rd quarter quell because it can mean death, again.Train to Busan and Kingdom is very, very good that's why it somehow shattered my expectations specially from the trailer.I can't also help but to compare it to Highschool of the Dead, it is shorter but a lot of things happened (I can let this go because I have to consider the pandemic which limits resources and locations.)",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

While ""Happiness"" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, ""All of Us Are Dead"" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra's characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra's who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations.

tt14169960,"Perfect? No, but def worth a watch, kinda addfictive.Zombies are very cool and scary, feel like Train to Busan zombies. I really don't understand why some people complain about them.Characters: they are many of them, some are more likable than others. What is nice is we never know who will die or not ; sometime a character got a big story but then die right after, sometime a ''secondary'' character (at first) will become important. So it's stressful when they are under attack, because we really don't know who will survive. Yea sometime they die in some weird/dumb way, but it would happen in a real zombie invasion. It's not alway super cool and heroic in my opinion.I don't agree when people complain that some characters just stand here and don't move. It's possible to be shocked when your best friend or dad or mom turn into a zombie. Not sure if you would do better, really.Perhap a bit too much teen drama for my taste, I was a bit annoyed at episode 7-8-9, but it's ok. I kind of agree that the serie could have been like 10 epiodes instead of 12.Not a fan of the pseudo intellectual jaded ideas of ''humanity is evil, bad so they deserve it'' and stuff.A good 8/10 for sure, try it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"All of Us Are Dead doesn't disappoint if you (like me) like a zombie film/series. There's plenty of zombie action and lots of gore, it's a fun show.Just don't expect too much from it, it's a zombie series after all, it's not meant to be taken that seriously. I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn't really much of a narrative there, it's just a lot of ""oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape"" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.If you like the genre then you'll probably enjoy it, if not, don't watch it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"The action and effects in this are pretty good and clearly they put some money into it which you then see start to disappear as the series continues. Maybe if they kept it short at 6 episodes instead of 12 they could of keep the money in the right places like hiring writers. The main premise of the story is so stupid once revealed I only kept watching to see how this not ""Train to Busan"" would crash and burn. It's obvious this was made during the great zombie hype of that better movie. They even reference it in the show multiple times like a dumb nod to the fan base. We get it. They watch a zombie move and yet learned nothing from it about survival.Ok so the dumbest part is that the origin of the virus was created by a high school science teacher in response to his son being bullied. You would think ""oh is it to infect the bullies."" No. He infects his son thinking that it will make him stronger and fight, which he shames his son for not fighting back. The school for some dumb reason just lets the bullies do whatever and it's not like it's established that the bullies have rich parents or parents in a position of power in the school. The school just doesn't want the controversy and tells its own faculty members to just let their kids get abused and keep it silent because it will look bad for the school. How does any of that make any sense? The bullies are putting rape videos up online and the school thinks the problem is the victims complain about it because that makes the school look bad not the rape videos. South Korea must be pretty messed up if that's the logic their schools take.So science daddy instead of doing the more logical and doable things, like sending his son to another school, decides he needs to create a virus to help evolve his son but oh no it just turns his son into a zombie and he attacks the bullies back but doesn't infect them and daddy locks him up in his house where he manages to infect his mother who has no lines other than to be a zombie. So I guess she had no say in the whole turn her son into a zombie because he's a wimp against a gang of bullies.So I'm not a writer but I think almost any other explanation for the virus would have been better than the whole dad is motived by his weak son to create a virus. It gets worse when the dad is caught by the police and tells them all the answers to the virus are on his laptop including alluding to the fact that the solution to a cure is on there. He doesn't give them a password so I guess he just leaves all his mad scientist stuff out there on an unsecured laptop in a high school and yet he works at a school where the computers are password protected. Sure lets just ignore that one. Anyway, they get the laptop and there is nothing but stupid videos of him blabbering about nonsense like a dumb incel complaining about the current state of mankind and thus he needed to create the Chad virus so his son would become an alpha. Ugh. They don't show anything that looks like scientific documents or research. The videos on the laptop only concluded that the only cure is to kill them which he couldn't do to his son and wife. So why did he waste everyone's time saying that the only solution was on his laptop instead of telling them there is no cure!This show has a storyline problem like that, where it builds up something like characters are going to have a redemption story arch only to punk out on it, to be edgy I guess. Mom dramatically runs to the school to save her son, they make seem like she will make it but no she gets bitten only to magically show up in time to trigger her son when he's escaping. Karen spoiled girl intentionally infects a poor student because she hates the poors and then once caught the other students exile her but the dumb teacher decides that the girl is worth saving for no reason and locks her in a room with food and water and dramatically tells her to help the other students later while she is getting eaten by zombies. Spoiled girl could have opened the room at any point when she could hear that the students were in the other room but she kept quite and barred the door. She only had a moment of empathy way late in the game when she decides she's going to go to the roof and help the other students with food and water only to be instantly killed by the half zombie bully in another denial of redemption. I could go on and on there are a million story lines like that.I knew it was going to get extra dumb once they had the bully, the rape victim, and the class president be the ONLY ones to come back from the dead and be half zombies. Of which they keep the bully around until the 2nd last episode to just show up many times for dramatic nonsense and fail and keep trying to kill the one guy who he has a grudge against for bashing out his eye and throwing him to the zombies because he was defending himself, oh and he defended the bullying victims once. I really thought they were going to have an epic battle with the bully vs. Rape victim but instead they made her crazy and destroy all the cellphones to try and stop her rape video from being automatically shared on social media, which wouldn't stop a scheduled post from being posted. She was on the top of the building literally watching 3/4 of her school running around as zombies and she's afraid they will see her rape video and judge her. THEY'RE ZOMBIES! It makes zero sense for her to have any motives like that. The show just needed a way to get ride of the cellphones so the kids couldn't call for help. They immediately destroy one computer after facebooking what's happening for one second and then yay all phones and internet get cut by the military because they have that power and over react to a prank video. There are so many better ways they could have handled the cut off of communication but they choose every dumb way possible to do it. Military has a million drones but only decides to use them to lure zombies to a spot to drop bombs. Nowhere did they even try to use them to find survivors and they tried to make it seem like some military conspiracy to be incompetent and murderous for no reason.Then the last episode ends everything in the dumbest way possible. One of the girls can easily sneak out of this heavily guarded and monitored military quarantine zone they have been in for four months now and goes up to the mountain I guess is a few feet near by and can see a small fire on the school roof from what looks like miles away, as if you could even see the light from such a small fire that distance. They decided its the half zombie school president sending a message so they decide to sneak out and go the next night. It is literally miles away through the woods and they can magically travel the distance they had a hard time navigating in the sun light on their way out of the school. Like we are really supposed to believe that they can travel all the way there and back and sneak back into the quarantine camp in one night. Then school president shows up and suggests there are more like her and just jumps off the roof like she's superman even though they established the half zombies aren't invincible. This show was written by zombies I'm done.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"We have had a bonanza of gory zombie movies and series, not to mention the entire Walking Dead saga and its numerous spin-offs. But I must say the Koreans have risen to the occasion, and are now outputting world-class material that provides a formidable challenge to Hollywood, and any other nation.At the heart of this gripping series is the journey of a small group of friends, torn apart by sacrifice and cruelty, kindness and savagery, but all the while growing closer together. Watching their very real pain when their friends die is truly terrible. This series manages to generate tension at times when you forget your surroundings and are yelling into the screen. And just like any other zombie genre, painful unexpected deaths get you when you least expect them.The series knows how to play with your emotions, making you cringe when sacrifices are made for seemingly senseless reasons, and when redemption is missed by mere seconds. There are plenty of twists and turns - no one is safe. The interesting idea of an internal struggle between human and zombie is also a new idea altogether.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,I would rate this close to TWD in writing and special effects - the story came up a little short and the Direction was a little slow at times but on balance a surprise to be sure. It took a couple of episodes to get into the characters but the inter stories were compelling - the show runner my have made a mistake in killing off too many of the characters but the primary ones survived and might give Netflix enough to go with another season - the ending was intriguing and left the door open for a second season with a whole new direction - I will watch it if it does and recommend it for those that are into Zombie movies - my wife isn't but she has other really good qualities.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I'd have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn't show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo's father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo's father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn't want to see them make another season.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

Frankly, I got tired of the Zombies and am probably tired of the whole genre. That said, I really did like the cast, who made me care about them, which kept me watching.

tt14169960,"What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? Well, let me just start off by saying that all the 1 star and 10 star reviews are wrong. This show has some flaws, but absolutely not enough flaws that would make it unwatchable.'All of us are dead' has this unique blend of comedic high school zombie action that, although used before, has not been achieved at this level of live-action television before. During the first episodes of my viewing, I definitely felt the typical ""how can they stretch this out to 12 episodes"", just to be proved absolutely wrong! The first episode is by far the worst, and with this usually being a red flag, it definitely is not here. 'All of us are dead' consumes the viewer, and already by episode 3 you will find yourself deeply attached to these characters, hoping none of them will die (except the bully) only to know that is not true.I believe the biggest strength to this show, is this attachment you will have towards these characters. With a massive cast of high school personalities, nearly all of them have a reason to cheer on their survival.'All of us are dead' often follows some typical tropes of zombie tv, but is filled with enough action and dialogue to make this feel fresh in its own way.If you can ignore some of the rare negative character actions, the not fully fledge out description of how the virus works, and the few repetitive scenes (such as the bully always reappearing again), then this show is a MUST WATCH for any zombie-lover.A complaint by reviewers which I found absolutely unnecessary was that some were shocked when certain characters died. One of the best things to come out of television in the past decade, was the unknownness of death brought on by shows such as 'Game of Thrones'. If you can't work past this inevitability of death, especially in a ZOMBIE show where one bite is the end, then why would you even start a show like this in the first place?Although I was not expecting or hoping there would be a season 2, the cliffhanger at the end makes me fairly certain there will be, and I am ok with that as long as it sustains some originality.Overall, by weighing all the negative and positives this show still maintains a solid 8 out of 10, but due to typical K-drama bashing, fake reviews, and hate due to unexpectedness, I will give this a 9/10!I am already wishing to re-watch it with a friend, just to see how and who they will form attachments too, as character attachment is needed for success!Thank you for this wonderful wonderful show, this was definitely a great way to start off 2022!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I'm halfway through the series ""All of Us Are Dead"" and say it's a win for zombie aficionados everywhere. Like most flicks of its kind it makes you wonder, was humanity already brain dead well before the apocalypse hit?There's a nice subtheme going on related to exam hell and the fact that students in Korea come out of 12 years of education with virtually no skills beyond those required for test-taking and punching fingers at SmartPhones.When watching this I can't help think of the Sewol Ferry and how a paucity of critical thinking skills was at least a contributing factor to that completely avoidable tragedy. I have a feeling it was very much in the minds of the creators as well.I have a personal connection with Andong, where much of the movie was filmed, having spent 7 years teaching at the national university there. As a side note, on several occasions I tried to get my students on-board terrorizing the community with a zombie night in lieu of something called English Education night, a series of demanding performances which everybody seemed to loathe.

tt20859920,"Oh this series, I am in love with this. After long long time a Kdrama to get me hooked.The best thing of this show is How interesting the character of Lee Jae - Wook's is. I mean you expect typical historical/ Joeson character but no, he is completely different with great comic timing and seriousness when its needed.His flirting scenes with Mu Deok is so subtle.One more thing to add here, apart from the good CGI and different story, is that unlike every other historical show there is no rush to make lead couple fall in love immediately. Its new take on historical show. They hate, they curse, they fight, there are moments between them. I like it.Last but not the least, the female lead - Jung So Min's character is very strongly built and it is not getting faded in the course of romance.

The plot , storyline, characters, direction, comedic timing, visuals , costumes, CGI , acting .. everything is just perfect.The only other fantasy story I loved this much was Harry Potter. The two are totally different in terms of story but they both are phenomenal works of art.The plot and character growth is absolutely brilliant. There has been a lot of thought put into every character. You'll find yourself caring for all the supporting characters as well.The male lead is charming, bold, funny and somewhat adorably childish at times. I also love his costumes. You'll find him dressed in magnificent shades of blue that are a treat to the eyes. I find myself constantly admiring the costumes and hair styles of the two leads.I love shows with a strong female characters and this one does not disappoint. The female lead can hold her own in the show. She is smart, pursues what she wants with a reckless boldness and is utterly refreshing to watch. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job than Jung So Min.Another thing I love about this show is how beautifully and effortlessly it changes from serious to funny within the blink of an eye. The background music and sound effects are perfect. I find myself laughing out loud in many places.All supporting characters are amazing too.The action and CGI is equally good. It keeps you on edge.

I never get emotionally invested in any character, but I kept cheering for Mu-deok throughout the season. It is a testament to Jung So-Min's acting skills that someone, with short attention span like me, binged watched entire season 1 in two days.Season 1 is a masterpiece you absolutely should not miss.However, I will never forgive the writers for the disastrous ending of season 1 which led to absolutely unnecessary season 2. I refuse to believe that writers as accomplished as Hong Sisters couldn't come up with better story for season 2 without killing Mu-deok.Entire season 2 makes you miss Mu-deok even more and reminds you why she was the ""soul"" of ""Alchemy of Souls"".",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

They keep pushing their limits and they are giving us truly amazing jewels with the fictional dramas.Im very used to historical dramas ( Sageuk) and I thought Alchemy of souls would be similar but with a touch of magic added to the mix ( something like Lovers of the Red Sky) but how wrong I was!This is a completely new magical universe creating new order of things and a world of fantasy ( although somehow women still were the prostitutes/gisaengs here, and all the students and soldiers were male but I won't complain a lot)I deeply enjoyed how well written the characters are, the layers and depth of each is just outstanding, needing to mention specially the crown prince (Shin Seung-ho ) whose constant internal struggle is just amazing to watch, he seemed the typical villain who is only mean and stubborn and is but was such a big surprise to getting to know him and seeing how he is so much more! I can't wait what comes next in the 2nd season.Why you should watch it?

tt20859920,"First and foremost I loved Alchemy of Souls and was its biggest fan, after finishing the first season I had given this show a 9/10 if not a 10/10. The first season had plenty of fight scenes, great character dynamics, interesting plotlines surrounding magic and world building, CGI magic and monsters with no expense spared in production, and complex female characters with their own powers. It was truly a feast for the eyes. Unfortunately, season 2 had to happen, and that gets a 7/10, maybe.Season 2 immediately changed the tone from happy to sad and emo, leaving many plot loopholes never fully answered. Additionally the plenteous fight scenes, world-building, soul shifters lore, and magical elements were all but gone.The new season also changed the female lead completely under confusing and illogical circumstances that I won't get into... but watchers were left with no longer a strong female lead but only the teasing description of one with ""untapped potential."" That potential was disappointingly never reached throughout the end of the series, and I never was able to see a strong female character again after the first few episodes of Season 1.Instead in Season 2 we were left with an all-powerful male character going through a depressive crisis, with some cute moments mixed in. Still, that story line and the confusing and unpredictable drama tied to it, was dragged out for way too long; especially considering this was a 30 episode drama. Simple issues ended up taking forever to resolve, and I was at the least hoping for a long and satisfying conclusion or maybe another season by the end of it. Wrong. They ended up dragging out that unfulfilling and overly-dramatic plot line-will they or won't they all die-until the very last episode. The happy ending was an afterthought, thrown in for possibly 10-15 minutes at the very end.Don't get me wrong, I am a sucker for a GOOD drama that plays with my feelings the whole while and then gives a long, satisfying, and good conclusion (Scarlet Heart Ryeo, Vincenzo, Itaewon Class). But this drama didn't do that, instead everything about the second season seemed like an afterthought that wasn't properly planned out. At this rate, just give me one season and don't waste my time with a second.I want to underline that this is no fault of the amazing cast of the show; I am still their biggest fan, but I am disappointed in the sloppy writing and production for what could've been so easily great. And furthermore, I am disappointed that certain characters were abandoned completely with no real reasoning.This serves as a warning for anyone going into this show, maybe stop after Season 1.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Season 1 is great until episode 19.5.Honestly the worst ending.Agree with some others who said that the writers forgot about their audience.What was the whole point of building such a great story in all those episodes, only to butcher it all at S01E20.That's how my heart felt.Brutally butchered.Didn't think I could watch S02, but gave it a chance anyway.8/10 episodes in, and I'm still wondering why they couldn't have written it slightly different for it to end in one 20-episode season.Season 2 does no justice to Season 1 (at least, so far). Sub plots like discovering(or not) that you're a bad cook? How does this add value to the show.....
Some things are moving too slowly, while some others are moving too fast.Plot holes get bigger, or get haphazardly filled.Totally disappointed.I don't know any of them, but I feel so badly for the actors and actresses.I don't know how to recommend this show.On one hand, almost every episode was great in S01, many heartwarming, tear-jerking moments. It had a little bit of every genre too, which blended really well to build what potentially could have been the greatest Korean TV drama.But be ready to have your heart be steam-rolled in episode 20..

Mu doek deserved better.The way they built up the premise in first episode of season 1 was good. Satisfying ending for Jang Gang also but tragic for both main characters.Crown prince character, Seo Yul, Dang gu were all good. Loved Master Lee. Supporting cast fabulous work. And Jin Mu and the queen played their role perfectly.Writers got tired i guess or were changed perhaps.

tt20859920,"First of all, I must say that Season 2 cannot get here fast enough! When the last episode ended, I literally groaned that I had to wait but was actually thrilled that this story was going to continue. Such a lush and beautiful story is too good to end here.Once again, the Koreans continue to prove why they are the most proficient storytellers in the world in film and television. I've been trying to think of another fantasy series that was heartfelt and full of luscious characters like this one. The ""Lord of the Rings"" film series is the only other one that comes to mind. That tells me just how incredible this series has been. And what makes this series soar is that it is story and character-driven. While it has some incredible special effects, they only enhance the core, which is what is supposed to happen in high-quality story-telling.In a fictional kingdom populated by mages, we have a power struggle going on to possess the ""ice stone,"" a stone of magic that can bring people back from the dead. Of course, anyone who seeks immortality would have a strong desire to possess such a relic. There is also a differentiation between magic and sorcery. Sorcery is forbidden magic that goes against nature itself. And one of the main devices of sorcery is soul-shifting. This means that a person dies but shifts their soul into another body. In some cases, soul-shifting can also mean trading bodies. This, of course, is forbidden magic.At the center of the story is Naksu, an infamous soul assassin who was hunted down by the mages of the kingdom. Mortally wounded, she is able to soul-shift into another body and take her identity; the identity of Mu Deok. However, because of her new body, she has no access to her energy in order to perform magic. In short, she's a regular person. However, her drive and desire to reacquire her energy and carry out her threat of killing those responsible for the deaths of her family members, is still very much at the forefront of her mind.We then have Jang Uk, a somewhat spoiled and lazy young man who is supposed to be learning various forms of magic, despite also being cut off from his energy due to an edict from his father. He's given no reason why, and so he spends much of his time lazing around and doing nothing until Mu Deok shows up and gets a job as his maid. However, it doesn't take Jang Uk long to realize Mu Deok's true identity, and he asks that she train him and become his master.One of the central themes of this story is what is more important? Power or Love? It's ironic that most people find love to be a weakness. What they fail to realize is that power without love IS weakness. Love is the most powerful force in the universe. This is something that Mu Deok must face and decide, which becomes an important factor when she is ultimately forced to decide what she wants: her power back or Jang Uk.The settings created for this series are absolutely incredible. I have to believe that most of the fictional towns are sets, and they are elaborate enough to rival any major film project.There are so many amazing performances in this series, that it is incredibly difficult to pick one that stands out from the rest. Lee Jae Wook (Jang Uk) and Jung So Min (Mu Deok) are absolutely fantastic and they have great chemistry together. One of my personal favorites was Kim Do Ju (Maidservant Kim) who was too exquisite for words. She is such a lovely woman, and her performance really stood out for me. However, the performance of Jo Jae Yoon as the villainous Jin Mu was captivating, to say the least. More often than not, a story is only as good as its villain. Imagine Star Wars without Darth Vader or Lord of the Rings without Sauron. They just don't work nearly as well, and Jo Jae Yoon gives a stellar performance as the villain behind the throne; the man pulling all of the strings. I've seen Jo Jae Yoon once before in ""Descendants of the Sun,"" but this role feels like it was tailor-made for him. He's deliciously evil and corrupt with little smirks that make you want to hit him. What makes his performance so grand is that he never plays Jin Mu in an over-the-top way. We have no angry outbursts or rage-filled speeches. He's calm, level-headed, and far brighter than people give him credit for.Of course, as with so many Korean series, we have moments of love, humor, inspiration, and even wisdom. Koreans are masters of character. They are always multi-leveled and multi-dimensional, much like real people.The fight scenes are all well-choreographed. Some of which reminded me a little of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I also like that they explain the magic. Robert Jordan, who wrote one of the most epic fantasy series of all time in his ""Wheel of Time"" series, is considered to have explained the science of his magic better than any writer ever. But Alchemy of Souls comes really close as we learn how magic and energy are used.This series is grand on an epic scale. Even a 20-episode series with each episode at an average of 75 minutes went by at a clip because I was so vested in the show. As I stated before, I cannot wait until the next series comes out. They ended things on a great cliffhanger that made me keep looking at the clock and going, ""Oh, no! It's almost over!"" Yeah, I didn't want it to end. For me, this is one of the best fantasy series I have ever seen, and frankly, it was the central theme of love and power that kept me coming back for more. And yes, I can't wait for more!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

A magnificent East Asian mythology that seems to have been fused with the best elements of Shakespearean tragicomedy providing one of the best series that Netflix has to offer.The sets are sumptuous, the cast are incredibly gorgeous and the fight scenes choreographed to perfection.

tt20859920,"I am an European, but a fan of Korean tv shows. The first part with its 20 episodes belongs to the best I have seen yet: A great fantasy setting with a convincing world, a great story which is told in a very interesting way uncovering layer for layer, a very new take on a love story which is at the same time the story between master and study. So if you have seen episode 1-19 it is almost 10/10 (for me the music is often too syrupy and the comic relief sequences are sometimes a bit too clumsy to really reach the top).But in episode 20 they introduce new and vital information how the story world works and immediately make a very crude use of it. This is so embarrassing because up to this point all major plot elements have been carefully prepared in advance, often many episodes before they make use of them. It seems as if either someone else wrote this episode or they decided in the last minute to introduce these new plot hooks for the second part.Well, the second part is a mess in more than one aspect. First of all of they replaced the actor for the female lead (Jung So-Min). For twenty episodes you watched her in many scenes and many close-ups - and Jung So-Min is an very talented actress bringing the many aspects, the character is supposed to have, convincingly to life: She is sullen and dismissive, scornful, condescending, reluctantly affectionate, insolently submissive, tenderly concerned, full of love and desperate. And she can switch between all of them in a second and make you believe in the reality of the character. The new actress is not bad, but by far not as good as Jung So-Min. The chemistry between Jung So-Min and Jae-Wook Lee, who is also very good, makes the first part to something special. And somehow these feeling cannot be shifted to a new face.Add to this that the second part lacks the subtlety in plot building of the first and the ending has all the silly bluntness of the final scenes of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.It would be great to know why they botched this series which could have been a masterpiece so badly. And who are they?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"The first 20 episodes were well acted with interesting plot twists and character development. The second season was the exact opposite: bad acting and muddled plot development . I couldn't believe the absurd attempt to expect the audience to buy into the characters foisted on the public. Even the actors themselves looked like they were suffering. The ending was so bad it could only have been scripted to placate a fan base demanding a ""happy ending"". What were the Hong sisters thinking? The acting was so lackluster that it was hard to watch . I had watched the first season three times it was such a pleasure. I hated the second season to the degree that I will never ever watch the first season again. There was too much repetition of familiar memes in the second season that it became boring and I had to fast forward to stop yawning.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Season 1 (10/10): The first season is a really good season, probably the best historical/fanatasy drama I have ever seen. The storyline is just really unique and pulls you in fairly quickly. The balance between comedy, romance and action is just perfect. The characters are all really charismatic and interesting. You get to see many different stories develop through the characters and you grow to love most of them. My favorite thing about this series are the visuals. The whole series is just like eye-candy. I could honestly watch this series just because of the visually pleasing scenes. The graphics are amazing as well. And the soundtrack really just pulls it all together.Season 2 (7.5/10): The second season continued with the great visuals, but something just felt a little off compared to the first season. The first episode in this season was a great starter, but episodes 2-7 weren't honestly that interesting. I feel like the story only started to take off in episodes 8-10. Don't get me wrong, the second season was still decent, but it just didn't live up to the same standard as the first one.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt20859920,"I watch parts 1 and 2 back to back. Like many, I was disappointed by the last two episodes of part one. That was simply because I wanted a happy story resolution. The writers could easily have done that but logically expanded the story to its next logical step. If I had to wait a season between parts, I would have been devastated. Fortunately I didn't have to do that, going straight to the second part. I was tremendously rewarded.In total, there's 30 episodes, each running up to an hour and a half. That is a massive amount of story!!!I'll keep it short. This series, even when viewed as a dub, is one of the best, if not the best (depending on the day) televised programs that I have ever been privileged to watch. The writing was incredibly well done. The world building was intricately developed. The acting was top notch. The production and music was excellent.I can't recommend this more highly. Absolutely superb.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I have to also give praise to the writers and director.........their talent is over the top and I know the second season will not disappoint! I am in awe over the amazing story telling by the writers and the directors ability to convey the writers story from the written words to the big screen where the characters come to life.Finished the second season.......boy was I amazed that the second season was just as good if not better than the first season!

I know that one of the two seasons is now English dubbed, but ever hopeful for both seasons. Everything is superb.

I suppose there is a power struggle going on but often the lines of demarcation are blurred And the ubiquitous grey-haired villain pretty much plays the part he was born to play.

S02 is rushed, it has plenty of plot holes and there are plenty of scenes which simply do not go along with the rules set up in S01. The cinematographic part (but cut!) is doing well and actors are amazing. But again, I would expect, as we had a possibility to see Jin Buyon's adult body through all S01, that instead of the child, they make cameo of Jung So Min.

We never get to see the feared assassin style on her enemies instead she leaves it because ""she has left that life"".

I was expecting naqsu and jang uk to actually fight together and killing soul shifters and enemies. But the personalities have completely changed and become lesser interesting.It would have been better for me if sul had just climbed the tree with mu deouk in season 1.

tt20859920,"Although the production values are very high and the SFX are done well, what I enjoy most about this series is that it focuses primarily (and very interestingly) on the relationships between the characters, with an emphasis on romantic relationships. In so doing, it pushes the boundaries of gender relationships in atypical ways for this genre (for example, in Part One the lead male character becomes the disciple of the lead female character). Women have very central and powerful roles in this series, a break with tradition which I very much enjoy. The acting is also first-rate. Highly recommended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

Season 2 didn't had the same chemistry between the character and the storyline was dragging a lot.

tt20859920,"I think this is my most favourite TV show ever.I LOVED the fantasy and the creativity of the different magic that can happen in that fictional world.I loved the awesome fighting scenes, their fictional moves were cool and general fighting was great- although the fighting scenes maybe could have been a little longer at times personally I love watching cool stunts and martial arts.Every single character was awesome!! I loved them all but if i had to choose, my favourite character was the physician Heo Yeom, he was so funny and cute. And obviously all 3 friends Jank UK, Seo Yul and Park Dan Juk because they were such cool mages, so powerful and had big hearts (kind people).But the main thing I loved was the fantasy world, the writers could do so much with that world i think, they could write so much more about the different types of magic there is, the different relics they have etc. Etc. - in my opinion they could turn it out in many many seasons. Even exploring different characters more and how they came to what they are like Master Lee Cheol and Park Jin ... though I would miss seeing Jang UK and Naksu! Or another evil could arise and Naksu and Jang UK are involved in trying to stop that.The romance between Jan UK and Naksu/ Mudeok was adorable and very endearing, I just wanted to watch more! And it made my heart warm!I was slightly dissapointed how little we saw of Jang Uk's father, he was SUCH a cool character, they could have done much more with that.But the overall story throughout the two seasons was so captivating!!!! I'm a little ashamed to say this, but want to compliment the writers and actors so I will admit I was literally addicted to this show! I couldn't stop watching it, I would go to bed so late evrry night just to watch more because it was so captivating! ( I normally do not go to bed late!)
I watched the whole 2 seasons pretty quick, I think in 2 weeks.Lastly, all the actors were perfect in my eyes. They played really believable characters. Great acting. And nearly all of them were gorgeous/ handsome 😍.Recently I have seen SOME actors in American TV shows who are not genuine or believable to me.. and it ruins the show a little (I am English and watch a lot of Amercian tv shows)... but I did not get that from this show.

The story line kept me intrigued throughout the entirety of the show and the plot twists were simply scrumptious.Styling and cinematic/visual effects are crucial for me and this drama did not miss. The music was also well done.There is one tiny plot hole though but it's pretty easy to ignore. Basically, the king impregnated Do-hwa in Jang Gang's body which led to her giving birth to the late king's son, Jang Uk.

I didn't, however, like the dialogues - both seasons have the characters talking in riddles and not really getting to the crux of the discussion. This may just be how they ""prolong"" the series.Season 2 started off well but episode 3 onwards, things get super confusing and unnecesaarily complex.

And not only the different actor,but whole different charakter too.btw, I can put up with the slow pace and the fact that nothing happens in most of the episodes, but they made a second season in which there are only a series of frustrating scenes, it simply stops being watchable and I easily lost the will to watch the series which was fantastic at first.without almost any happy or hopeful scene, it's just a series of bad things happening.

Combining the real body of Jin Buyeon who was weaker in physical ability and with Naksu's spirit was super enjoyable. I used to wonder how Naksu would return to her full life, but Buyeon had to die for that. It's a sad fact, and I actually wasn't prepared for it.Surprisingly, the plot is twisted in S2, where two souls can be still alive as well as Bu Yeon's body but with Naksu appearance.. but I wasn't ready with the player change.. and as I tried to adapt with that look change, but I then also wasn't ready for the character change.. it is so upturned.. and how the new Jang Uk can also easily fall and be romantic, I somehow felt the new but real Naksu just stole all the fruit of the old but fake Naksu's (Mu-deok) love struggle with Jang Uk... and for that I felt betrayed. Because Jang Uk was previously a difficult-to-fall-in-love person, despite having a warm heart. Jang Uk in fact could only fall for someone who had Jin Buyeon's body and Naksu's spirit, which was reflected as Mu-deok in the S1 storyline.. In real life, there is a typical of people like that, which made them interesting and special....Hence, If we adhere to the storyline, Jang Uk will first pursue someone who resembles Mu-deok, and then check for the presence of blue spark eyes (there was a scene that applied), whereas if girl does not resemble Mu-deok. If the two conditions are not met, Jang Uk will continue to search for Naksu's soul in order to fall in love again. Unfortunately, in S2, Jang Uk falls in love with someone who is extremely attractive and appears to have Mu-Deok's memory. Even though Jang Uk appears moved by the memory of the new Naksu, which leads him to consider loving her, this goes against Jang Uk's previous storyline. Furthermore, S1 is more humorous, with romantic bickering, whereas S2 is more serious, sadder and has a far way too easy ending.Actually, I think I can accept new Naksu as long as Mu-deok can be remembered appropriately and when switching to the new Naksu should be played more smoothly, because after all, Mu-physic deok's can't be reappeared due to ""her crime"" at the end of S1... but sadly, not only does saying Mu-name deok's seem illicit in S2, the storyline is also forced. Made me only want to finish S2 just to be able to move on to other drama.. I hope no other producers made this kind of mistakes again in the feature...Overall, I love every characters there, and especially the storyline of how Jang Uk finally achieve his masterpiece skill ..",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"I absoluty loved season 1 of alchemy of souls, but i was very dissapointed with season 2. I just wasn't as good as season 1. Also the actress chance was not it. If you really want to enjoy this show then i would recommed only watching the first season. Because the second season kind of ruins the show. I am just really pissed on the writers for not making season 2 a banger, like they did with season 1. Also the love triangle story that they have putten in the show is not that good. It was okay in season 1, but in season 2 they could have done so much more. Overall season 2 is a not watch and season 1 is a must watch.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Alchemy of souls is magic where an individual can possess another's body. Naksu is a feared assassin who becomes trapped in the body of a blind girl (Jung So-min) who goes to work as a servant to Jan uk (Lee Jae-work) who is from a noble family of mages. The story has a complex plot that evolves over time and my only criticism would be that in episodes near the end the story stalls as we see explanations of what's going on. Great cast and an interesting storyline makes it an enjoyable watch, although I am concerned about season two as some of the great lead characters will not star in the follow up and even though I am sure it will be ok they will not be able to replicate the lead chemistry we had in this.Update on season 2:
Kudos to the writers, director and actors as they have proved my reservations completely wrong. The story drew me in from the beginning and Ko Yoon-Jung the lead replacement was totally brilliant in taking the character into a background supporting role who you soon became to care about, and love.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"... a complete disappointment.A 10 out of 10 for Part one. It was a great tale.But part 2, I really get the feeling that they had to alter the story line to make up for not having Jung So-Min for part two.It just did not make sense.Naksu trapped in the body of Bu-Yeon, a priestess with godly divine powers, which prevented Naksu to run wild. Yet all it took was a set of bells to take care of that.But I could have lived with that as she could easily be revived with the ice stone.The whole part 1 actually seemed to build up to that. Part 2 just inconsistently applies reasoning for things to be as they are then, while they never appeared in part 1.Bu Yeon's appearance is like Naksu now, instead of Mu-Deok. Why? Because only Naksu's soul is now in her body. (it can be questioned if Bu Yeon's soul was actually in Mu-Deok in part 1) Mu-Deok's appearance did not change, and nor did any other soul changer's body.Master Lee is suddenly capable of depetrifying a soul changer's body, while in part 1, one would need the ice stone to do that.Yes Master Lee reached Hwansu, but if that equals the usage of the ice stone, then Master Lee could have solved all problems easily in part 1.We can increase the list of inconsistencies from part 2, but I will end my rant just to state my dissappointment:There has never been a series that I viewed that got me this bad. Usually I would shake my head and move on, but this time, I am so annoyed by it, it is hard to let go. I just cannot understand why they took this route. Perhaps they could not book Jung So-Min for part 2, but it would have been so much better to delay part 2 until she was available again.Jang Uk is being put forward as the main character, but in reality Mu-Deok was the main character. She carried part 1, I think the makers really underestimated that.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I didn't even move when I watched it because every episode was so interesting.When season 1 ended, I was so happy knowing that there's gonna be s2, I counted the days for it to come.Aaaand surprise surprise, WOW I was just sitting there confused of what I was watching. So many plot holes, every week I tried to be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt. But holy cow, it was just a huge disappointment.How can anyone let this happen in S2? I guess the writers' original souls from S1 have shifted completely and their bodies were being taken over by Patrick star from SpongeBob. That's the only explanation I can think of. Wow.. I honestly believe that ALCHEMY OF SOUL IS REAL now, thanks to the insane shift from S1 to S2.I just finished the entire season 2 and I am just LOST for words.

tt20859920,"I wanted to give this show a 1 out of 10, because the ending of episode 20 actually ruined the entire show. But that would be unfair to the actors and actresses who all did a phenomenal job. The writers however, do get a 1 out of 10 for the garbage ending. This is the first time I've ever felt an ending was so bad that it ruined an entire show in retrospect.I really enjoyed season 1 of the show. Season 1 gave it's viewers a lot of magic, lore, world building, and plots that stretched credulity, a lot of near misses and a lot of drama that allowed us to see the heroes escape with barely the skin on their backs. There was this feeling that goodness will always prevail and conquer evil. Then the last 30 minutes of season 1 happened. Why on earth would the writers ruin everything they built?I won't go into too many details but why give your viewers a sweeping and epic romance, where Love and sacrifice conquers all in every episode only to rip it away from your viewers' hearts at the end of the season? Suddenly I felt like I wasted my time watching the show and regretted the 20 hours I spent watching every episode because the end result was so unfulfilling, made even more unfulfilling because they completely abandoned this great love story in season 2. I could live with ep 20, if the original love story had been resurrected. (Edit to note, I finished season 2 after the initial shock of of the bad ending of S1 and enjoyed it despite the nonsensical storyline).I was hoping this was one of those situations where the heroes would overcome evil. The fact that the royal family and all the mages would even listen to the bad guy after all the evil he had done was extremely bad writing, all the while punishing the good guys for every single thing that went wrong. Even giving one character who had been honorable the whole time, a bad or dishonorable funeral for one mistake while forgiving the bad guy who engaged in many egregious and highly unforgivable acts.When the writers throw away something, like a love story that they spent an entire season building, only to rip it away from their viewers, is it because the writers think they're cool because they tried to write a Shakespearean level tragedy hoping their viewers will complain about how much they miss the character? If so, it is the height of arrogance. We don't just miss the characters, it makes us hate and resent the show. It really irritates me because these sort of tragedies are not fun or enjoyable to the viewers. I watch for happy ending, or at least the characters ending up together even if they're not fully happy with everything. The viewers have stopped caring about your characters and stop caring about the show because they've lost the whole reason why they were watching it in the first place.I really detest shows where a bad guy keeps getting forgiven for every wrongdoing they have done and no matter how egregious their sins are they are forgiven but if the heroes make one mistake they are punished severely while the bad guy continues to get away with murder. I felt that the heroine was not treated properly at all and as a result neither were the viewers. I would say that the writers even betrayed the viewers because the story feels like a sadistic lie. I could not focus on season 2 because of the new female lead and of course she is a beautiful and lovely young lady but I feel that is why they wanted her there, for no other reason except that she is younger than the heroine of season 1. They took a great character and replaced her with a very generic young beauty which is just boring. I started season 2 but I doubt I will finish it. I'm already scanning for a new show. I think the male lead, playing Jang Uk is fantastic and I watched mostly for the energy he brought to the show. The way their characters were treated in ep 20 was just awful. What a disservice to him. The lead actress in Season 2 did grow on me, and I grew to like her eventually, to her credit. I did want more from the romance aspect of the story, to hopefully make up for the shock of season 1 ending so poorly, but id grade the romance somewhere in the middle for season 2. The lead male actor was also very good in season 2 but he somehow managed to look even taller and more ganglier than he did in season 1, probably due to some noticeable weight loss.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt20859920,"I am very seldom impressed by films or series. I may like them more or less, but the Alchemy of Souls is an exception. It is a master piece.The storyline is complex but never ever does it lack logic (which in fact reminds me of Babylon V. It is the only other series, although from an entirely different genre, that never lost a thread. Everything eventually lead to an explanatory conclusion even if you had to wait several series for it). The story telling is also stringent and covers every aspect needed to be compelling. It is very exciting, sweet, has many twists, occasionally gruesome but all together it forms a cohesive stroy line which makes you long for the next episode.The acting is formidable as is the photography and scenography. It is beautiful!Without offending American viewers I hope, it must be said that it is clinically free from American cultural stereotypes and ways of telling a story on the screen. I find this wildly exciting not to say refreshing. The same cannot be said for the other grand media event of late: The Rings of Power (I have reviewed this as well).So, as far as Alchemy of Souls go, I have nothing negative to say. It is simply wonderful no matter from what perspective. It is simply a must-watch series providing an insight into an entirely different kind of story-telling than most Western viewers are accustomed to.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt20859920,"Ultimately, that's what it was.I've been asking myself what in the world was it...is it about the Korean romance fantasy, Alchemy of Souls, that hooked me? Here I am a baby boomer in the USA, but boy did this Netflix series hook me and launch an absolute fan.So I suggest watching it; especially if you are a lover of romance, metaphysics and fantasy, with tasty bits of comedy sprinkled in.I am not a person who likes dark stories ... with dark beings just for the sake of the Dark; feeding that part of human nature that is mesmerized by the power that exist there. I don't like blood and gore; although this one has blood not so much gore. It also has some of the darkest beings... but there is a level of substance that delivers so much more. Character. True friendship. Endurance. Loyalty. Love that will not die.So once again I say, do yourself a favor and watch Alchemy of Souls. Netflix has dubbed the first season in English and I'm hoping the second season which contains the last episodes, and aired here in the West this past weekend, will be dubbed in English soon.There are 30 episodes in all. The actors are excellent and most often beautiful. The storyline superb.

Bad guys aren't just bad for the sake of it, the character development is nuanced and builds nicely as the episodes continue on, and they have a lot of comedic relief which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience.The fantasy aspect combined with the love and drama makes for an easy, fun watch. It hooks you in right from the first episode, which really is a testament to the fantastic writing, directing and a great cast. The effects look pretty cool and the world building is very nicely done.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Alchemy of SoulsS1:
Alchemy of Souls has been entertaining thus far; a supernatural martial arts period drama (a la Crouching Tiger) that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's about mages who practice forbidden magic allowing them to swap souls, potentially staying youthful via swapping into younger bodies, but at the risk of turning into petrifying zombies.The leads (and main supporting cast) are very charming and affable, especially the character of Mu Deok played by Ms Jung So Min, who is particularly great at sarcasm. As I really enjoyed Uncanny Counter & Sky Castle , it was great to see those cast members here.It's similar in tone & as thrilling as Stranger Things. Netflix really knocked it out of the park in 2022 w/ 25 to 21, All of us are Dead, Tomorrow, Stranger Things 4, and now Alchemy. Some K Dramas don't have enough content to fill 16 episodes, all 20 of season 1 flew by.Point deducted only for the awkwardly hammy acting of Seo Hye Won, who plays the pickpocket So-i. She was hilarious in Business Proposal, but was distracting here.Wonderful score and soundtrack.S2: still fun, fingers crossed it has a satisfying conclusion.9.5/10 A+",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"This is a fun and entertaining fantasy-based K-drama. The story and characters follow familiar K-drama formula (or perhaps a live-action anime adaptation), but there's nothing wrong with that. Very easy story to get into. Although some call this a ""historical"" fantasy, this is not based on any actual Korean history. There has never been a kingdom called Daeho, nor mages or soul shifters in Korean mythos as depicted in the show. It is still a very creative expansion of the fantasy genre, leveraging the beautiful architecture and colorful costumes of the Korean tradition.The actors are quite likable and the humor is enough to provide some comic relief, not too much to ruin the show. You'll recognize the pattern of characters if you watch enough of these K dramas. What makes or breaks is the chemistry, and I think they did a good job with this cast.Special effects throughout the series are not overdone. Swordplay and action sequences look to be reasonably well choreographed, though clearly it's not the main theme of the show. The usual court and family intrigue is there.I'm binging through this and enjoying it! Worth watching.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

This drama had sooooo much potential in S01, even after the controversial ending. But then they (and I'm blaming the writers here) write a basic plot and ruin EVERYTHING.I stayed through S02 because S01 hooked me in. Honestly, shotty CGI and bad cinematography can be excused IF YOU HAVE A GOOD WRITING STAFF. I don't know if the staff from S01 was fired or what, but whoever is responsible for this change: you're an id*ot.An example of the bad writing: They did the women so wrong in S02. Since this is officially a rant: I can't believe that I spent months telling people to watch this Kdrama over the summer, only for them to devolve this badly in S02.The epilogue was the only good part of S02.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

For many, squid games.Truth be told, I never wanted to venture into Asian dramas as I was a victim to many terrible Japanese dramas during many visits to a relative and sadly, I thought it was a regional thing.Oh my.... How wrong I was.American dramas that offer magic and tongue in cheek humour usually have that and some yeah... Blatant side effects. This is certainly way above that level.The costumes, the sets, humour, makeup and stunts are brilliant. Okay, the effects are... Because it's magic, blatant. But even at that, you can tell a greater amount of creativity and effort went into it than the general TV shows like grimm etc.To conclude, only watched the first season so far. Not usually the genre I would go for unless I've been subjected to it by someone else. But it's by far the most enjoyable I've experienced for a very long time. Storyline is great. Characters are strong. Interactions are good.

That in fact in my opinion is what denied this show to end sensibly in its allocated episodes. Even prolonged last episode contained too much comedy, when it should've at least tried to be more serious.

Especially valet Kim is my secret favorite, you just have to love her. Jang Uli is a dream, his transformation, his charm and his overall charisma take the viewer on his journey. The lead actor fits perfectly and he's just great to look at. But I have to say that I liked the main actress better in the first season, she was the right counterpart to the main actor.

tt20859920,"Forgive me for being verbose, but I am excited that I no longer have to depend on American television, which has not been all that great this past decade!I also must preface my review by stating that I am not into Korean idols, pop, or Korean Dramas. I didn't know who any of these actors/actresses were before watching the show. To be honest I still do not know who they are, but I will look out for the lead male& female in other films/shows, because they are incredible!I love historical fantastic dramas!This show was recommended to me after I was advised to watch the Glory and from there I found Alchemy of Souls!!!The show was excellent! The writing was great, the special effects, the plot, *the sword play, the magical elements, but it was the character development& acting that made this show more than just great! The chemistry between the main actors as well as the secondary characters was stellar!I have only written one other review regarding a show where I was just as pleased with the cast, which was TLK. This show did something that only they have been successful in doing imo; they revealed the main characters through those around them and built a special attachment with the audience with most of the cast.Review
It is very difficult to hide major plot points through secondary characters without it coming off as a convenient& lazy way to push the plot forward. It never felt as if the writers depended upon these cheap tricks rather the plot is intricate and immersive.I must admit that the first season was my favorite in terms of storyline, and it had a perfect balance between comedy& drama.However, the progression of Jung Uks' character throughout the first season into the second was a perfect display of character growth& development. He went from being this hopeful, naive, and immature Mage to a somewhat broken, powerful hero! Which makes perfect sense if you've watched the show. He has a depth to him that he lacked in the first season, and the writers couldn't have done a better job at switching the roles between Junk Uk and Naksu in terms of who they were to one another.Naksu, due to her memory loss, was akin to Jung Uk in the first season; hopeful, joyous, naive! She became a light to him, and the one who wanted to protect him contrasted to the first season where Junk Uk protected her& was always hopeful.Although I was disappointed in the switching of lead actresses, I never felt like Naksu was a different person to Mu Deok; they just looked different.I was also impressed with the love story; no matter what body she inhabited; they would still find and love one another.I must boast about the lead Actor, and I hope for either a third season or too see him again, because he is an incredible actor and has gained a fan of his work.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"So I really liked season one although was very disappointed in the season finale. There was no resolution to not only the main plot but any of the lesser character subplots. It ended with not a single satisfaction. I generally don't mind a Cliff hanger, but you have to give us something hopeful.Regarding season two, I see many are unhappy with it. However, I don't belive their complaints are anywhere near the mark. I think the series was ruined for many by the season finale. Season two is just as good as season one. However, this is because season two is exactly the same as one. Exact same plot and character subplots, love stories etc. EXACTLY the same. All the headway they seemed to be making in the first season start all over from scratch in the second. Season two is basically the exact same story in everyway. It is very annoying. My only hope after 6 episodes is that this season will actually have a satisfying ending. Just a few episodes left for redemption.It is beautifully shot and well acted. The English dubbing was also done well.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt13634792,"This type of series and movies are the reason why I just love this genres. And this series is such a masterpiece. Its dark, its raw, it just defines this genre in the best way.REVIEW : This is a series that is not for the people with weak heart. If you love a series with happiness, with love, with perfect beautiful ending..then I will suggest that you should not watch it.Coming back to the series, right from the beginning, from the very first scene...each and every scene and episode is connected till the very ending, the very last scene. Right from the beginning..when the story starts.. slowly you start getting questions with each and every passing scene... and by episode 12-14 you are just filled with it. You are confused, you don't understand anything about what is happening, who is doing what, why its happening and many more such questions. And right from then you start getting the answers. All the dots start to get connected. Everything starts making sense. All your questions starts getting the answers for what you were wanting so long. All your assumptions starters getting to prove wrong. Everything you have thought just turns out to be wrong. You have to watch the very last episode..the very last scene so get all the answers. To get everything clear. To understand the story totally.This is a type of series where you have to keep your eyes and brain open. And if you don't understand korean then you have to make sure that you read each and every word that you see in the subtitles. Because if you miss anything, then you will not be able to understand anything after that... That's how connected each and everything is in this series ?.I must say that makers did a great job. The way everything is portrayed..its just brilliant. Actually I honestly don't know what is the correct word to describe the brilliance of this series. Its just mind blowing ?.ACTORS AND ACTING : Everyone, literally everyone did a great work. No matter how big or small was their appearance was, but every character have a strong impact. Non of the character was just for nothing. All the characters were equally important and meaningful. There was no unnecessary drama. That's what make it more amazing. You don't feel bore.The actors did not just played the roles, they lived that. You can feel their emotions through their eyes. All the pain can be seen in their eyes.LEE SEUNG GI (JUNG BA REUM): He is the person around whom the whole story moves. The main person who is the creator or the destroyer.. whatever you say?. The acting skill of this man, my God. He is just amazing in what he is doing. The way he presents his character..the ups..the downs..the shock. Everything he feels just gets transferred o you with his eyes. You find him wrong in the starting but then by the end you feel pity on him. You feel sorry for him. You feel that he didn't do whatever he did with his own wish, he just didn't had any option but just to do all those things even if he was wrong.LEE HEE JOON (KO MOO CHI) : This is his revenge story. The person who suffered right from the childhood because of no reason. He is the one who did everything to solve the mysteries. To get the people punished because of who his life was filled with pain. You can see that pain right in his eyes, in his body language, in each and everything he do. You can see his desperation of how bad he want to get them punished.PARK JOO HYUN (OH BONG YI) : The girl who faced a horrible incident in her childhood and slowly overcome it with the passing time. She is brave, courageous, loving, caring, understanding. She is the common but special girl. She one of the main character that holds a lot of meaning in the entire drama. A girl who struggled a lot. Bear all the physical and mental pain and still stands up to fight again.KYUNG SOO JIN (CHOI HONG JOO) : According to me, this is the person who the most mysterious. You have to watch the entire series to know about this person. She will keep on giving you surprises till the very end. By the way she is very beautiful ?.KWON HWA WOON (SUNG YO HAN) : The most innocent character of the entire series. The one with whom everything was so unfair. Like everything. He was the one who was just caught in the middle of every thing. Right or wrong. Who is the main character who is involved with everything in a different way.BACKGROUND MUSIC : The music is so deep, dark and it totally matches with the plot..the storyline. It adds more meaning and intensity to it. Its so catchy.RE-WATCH VALUE : If you ask me, honestly I may not watch it again as its a thriller-suspense-mystry series. And one you discover everything in the first time.. watch it again for the second time is no fun. But yes, if you are watching it with a friend then ya..you can watch it again. It will be fun to see his reaction with every surprise ?.CONCLUSION : This is a must watch for every suspense lover. Just don't miss it.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"7.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean mystery, crime, thriller television series with 20, 70 Minute, episodes.There is a serial killer on the loose and no-one feels safe. After his mother and father are victims, Ko Moo Chi (Song Min-jae) bravely identifies the killer causing one of the most notorious killers to be sent to prison. Fast forward and now Ko Moo Chi (Lee Hee Joon) is a detective who will stop at nothing to get the bad guy. He is on a personal mission to put as many killers behind bars as possible. It seems there is a new serial killer whose crimes rival the brutality of the ""head hunter"" the killer who killed Chi's parents. After several chance encounters with another police officer officer, Jetong Ba-reum (Lee Seung-gi) who is known for his good deeds and many, including Chi, wonder if he has what it takes, in terms of a hardened personality, to make it as a homicide detective. Nevertheless they team up to stop this new serial killer. Oh Bong-yi (Park Ju-hyun) sees Ba-reum as stability in a life that has been far from stable. Their romantic pairing is something her grandmother wished for seeing handsome and kind Ba-reum as a perfect pairing for her granddaughter who is haunted by a traumatic past. Choi Hung-ju (Kyung Soo-jin) is an investigative journalist specializing in stories about killers. Her work has her working with Detective Chi frequently and he values her opinion. They were once romantically interested in each other but life events drove them apart. Will they catch the killer through their combined efforts before he can kill many more? Is everyone who they seem?Spoiler alert***
What I liked about this series. It went very in depth on the psychology behind psychopathy. It showed very clearly how some psychopaths are experts at blending in with ""normal"" people and how those closest to them can be fooled. I liked the relationships between friends, former lovers, and even the interplay between the serial killers and the police. I thought all of the actors played their roles very well.What I did not like about this series:
1) It was so complex that it made the story hard to follow at times. The plot twists were frequent and you had to pay careful attention to things that may have happened several episodes ago or you may miss the significance of the latest twist. It caused me to tune out several times to let the story play out a little bit and get back to normal.2) I did not like the inconsistencies. For example the killer was a psychopath even as a child and had one of his father's mice (assumed). But if the mouse was his father's it did not make sense as he was in school when it showed him with the mouse and his father was put in jail before he was born. So, where did he get the mouse as a small child? Another inconsistency was when Bong-yi was rescued as a child by Ba-reum. He gives her a piggy back ride and they seemed to be about the same age. However, earlier in the show the Bong-yi commented on their age gap and it seemed to be significant, like maybe 10 years.3) An event with new characters would happen in one episode and seem to conclude then several episodes later they would mention the names of the people involved in the episode. By the time I would figure out what event they were referencing, the story would have moved along.4) I did not like that I felt I had no one to root for. I like Ba-reum early on but when he turned out to be bad, I was very disappointed. The rest had some serious character flaws, Bong-yi jumped to conclusions, Chi wanted to kill the bad guys and be judge, jury and executioner, and Chung-ju does not open up to anybody.5) Loose ends. There were a lot of unexplained things. Such as the mouse, why did Ba-reum have a mouse. The mouse almost seemed to be controlled by Ba-reum when it attacked the snake - what was that about? We also never got the full story of what transpire to PD Choi as a young child. What happened to her brother? How did the serial killer get her to work with him? The Oz organization was mentioned frequently but when things wrapped up we never got the full story of who all belonged to Oz and why they joined. The pregnant lady who was identified as having a child with the psychopath gene at the same time that Ba-reum's mother was, what happened to her and her child? There were so many psychopaths it was hard to keep track of who was who.6) Romance died. I know it was never fully intended to be a romance but there was a cute romance developing between Ba-reum and Bong-yi and then we found out the truth about him and that was that, as it obviously would be. But then even Detective Chi and PD Choi, they had a romance in the past and, at the end, Detective Chi indicates to another detective he still has feelings and might confess but then PD Choi and he sit down and talk about their feelings of guilt over the way things played out with the doctor. They sort of agree it sucks and they will live with that guilt then she just walks away and he drives off into the sunset in his egg truck. Felt like we had build up in both cases only to be let down in the end.7) There was a lot of emphasis put on the psychopath gene and, while they mentioned that there was a possibility the individual may not be a psychopath but a genius instead, they never pursued that angle. It is not dissimilar to what, in reality, is known about psychopaths that there are thrill seekers who have that similar flatline emotional state but do not exhibit as murderers, they may be thrill seekers (extreme sports), highly competitive business or finance moguls, or other such adrenalizing pursuits. It was unclear if the Doctor was thought to have the psychopath gene, he was part of the experiment so you could assume he did, however it was not clear.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Everything nicely unravels and explains as the episodes progresses.On another note the acting pedigree in Mouse is insane and it also comes with one of the most EPIC and memorable endings that I have ever seen in Kdrama history.Fair warning that its not for the faint hearted as there are a lot of tragedies to deal with which can be too depressing for some.Note : Watch 2 special episodes, ""Mouse the Predator"" after episode 15, before continuing on to the next episode. Very interesting and worthwhile.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

The creators are hinting at season 2 with new characters with story line set after the events of first season in the last 30 seconds of the finale episode after end titles.Brace yourself, I believe that this is not the end.

Noo!!They were friends and he took pictures of his crimes WAHT!!!Is it smart to write a headache script?The script is like the draft script that got refused because it not consistent.And don't get me wrong I liked the suspense and the action but it could be a science fiction.

I was afraid that they will left some of them with no answer but they closed the drama really well.-> It s a drama that makes you suspect everyone. What I liked the most is that everything they show is linked with somethimg else.-> Every episode they gave us pieces of puzzle but till the end you can t be sure if you put the pieces in the right spot.-> Also even if some said that 20 eps are too many, the action is going fast and I didn t feel that they are dragging it.-> The acting was so on point.In conclusion for me Mouse is one of the best k drama with a solit script, more genres combined and a lot of twists plots like even if you have a theory and it s right they make you questioning it.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"An old lady, motivated by her daughter's problems at school, goes to look for a part-time job at an intermediary agency. The agency employee rudely rejects her and, for some completely incomprehensible reason, leaves the office, leaving the grandmother alone. Left alone, grandma promptly empties the fridge full of juices and stuffs them into a bag (for no particular reason other than so that Detective Ko can later connect the clerk's bag full of those juices with the grandmother's disappearance). During that time, the phone in the office rings and grandma answers it, because ... well, that's the most normal thing to do, obviously. What a coincidence, a cleaning lady is wanted in, wait for this ........... the house of main suspect. Grandma takes the opportunity and sends herself there. Finally at her destination, she relentlessly sets about cleaning, and in her almost insane enthusiasm and desire to clean every inch of the house, she stumbles upon a locked remote room. In the basement. Locked up. Unlit. In such a situation, who wouldn't unlock it and enter, I ask you?The grandmother discovers what she shouldn't and runs away. But not to the police, oh no, that would mean she couldn't be followed and killed and the scenario couldn't continue. She runs away to her house, located in the middle of dark and deserted alleys, because, well ... she's afraid. And we know that terrified old people always prefer to choose dark and deserted spaces :)And then she meets her sad fate, which sets a new ""plot"" line in motion.Come to think of it, the whole school bullying/settlement scene was crammed in there just so Grandma would have a motive to look for a part-time job. No school bullying was mentioned either before or after. Ever.Finally, not that any of that really matters though. It's just a smoke screen to deceive the viewer, since it will be shown later that this is not this and that is not that, explained by an equally ridiculous sequence of instant obstacles and resolutions.I kid you not.That's the level of writing in this tiresome soap opera.

The actor is not chosen behind the scenes in a way that shows the actor's feelings, and as a result, these films are lame in terms of staging. But this is not the case in the series Mouse. And all these issues have been addressed. Many of the serials are such that they do not need any analysis, but you had to analyze the serial ""Mouse"" in order to understand what the director intends to do with this scenario! The story maintains its coherence and it is clear why it is moving forward. There was an irrational issue that we realized in the two new episodes was not such a thing and it went quite logically.

Props for how everything came together; however, the director is also responsible for editing...Editing: not without glitches and occasionally bothersome. There were jump-cuts that should not have occurred. Music segues and scene transitions were occasionally jarring. Maybe the series was artlessly recycled from the movie. The director should have made the editor fix these things.Notes: The talented writers use of misdirection in Mouse kept me second-guessing until the 19th episode. Much was improbable; none of that was unexplained. And plenty of themes to discuss after viewing. A tangled skein that fully needed 16 of its 20 episodes so the writers could address all the times viewers hit the stone wall of improbable action.My hat is off to the script coordinators, who kept all the threads in sight and without loose ends.

Too many of these and things begin to fall flat and boring. Too many attempts at being unpredictable becomes predictable. I stopped trying to keep track of the twists and stopped trying to untangle them in my mind. That was the only way I managed to stay engaged till the end.Still, kudos to Lee Seung-gi for once again a stellar performance.

tt13634792,An interesting series which proposes people are born with the psychopathic gene and then looks at detectives played by Lee Seung-gi and Lee Hee-joon trying to track down and arrest them. The plot is very convoluted and complex which is made worse by the way flashbacks are used which I found confusing. All the actors did a sterling job especially the killers and if the storyline was more linear with fewer episodes I would have awarded more stars. Also parts of the plot need you to suspend belief totally (e.g. Brain transplants) which is such a shame as if they had kept it simpler it would have been much better.,neutral,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
tt13634792,"Ok I watched carefully until halfway through second episode then read the reviews to see if it was worth my time anymore because it was already so depressing and dark. The hype really had me fooled that this would be a good series. But then I saw the reviews (both good and bad) and could see two things that really bothered me so I stopped watching.1)The ENTIRE premise is that there is something called a psychopath gene and if you have it, then you have a 99% chance of becoming a psychopath (using all famous serial killers and evil dictators, like Hitler, as examples of psychopaths) and only a 1% have a chance of becoming a genius (they use famous composers and artists as examples).And then, with a serial killer on the loose (called the Headhunter) the government takes a vote on whether or not they should pass a forced abortion law for anyone whose unborn baby tests positive for the psychopath gene.I mean REALLY??? So they claim they've done all this science to be able to tell that everyone born with that gene will either be a genius or a murderer. And there's no other option. There are about seven billion people on the planet who may also have this ""psychopath gene"" but since they've never been tested how could we ever possibly KNOW THAT KIND OF THING??TALK ABOUT JUNK SCIENCE!What about all those billions of people who may have that gene that live perfectly normal lives because they were raised properly and we simply didn't know they ""had the gene""? Oh well we don't address that. I mean seriously. The premise is just EVIL that a baby is in anyway BORN EVIL.And ya gotta love how the President of Korea decides to vote against killing all the babies solely because he had just found out his wife was expecting their first child. But that was the only be reason he didn't murder all the other people's babies. And then his assistant, who's clearly upset with him says something like ""Ok, but I hope you can live with yourself when we could have gotten rid of all crime and murders and evil for your child's future but didn't!"" Yeah, that makes sense since his child might be aborted and would have HAD NO FUTURE! LOL!And as if only psychopaths murder or do horrible things?? I got news for this show's creator: we are ALL capable of doing bad... even horrible, things. Like what about drunk drivers? Do you drink? If there's any alcoholism in your family you could become an alcoholic too. That's been proven....whether it's nature or nurture we don't really know. But it's true. So you might kill someone in a drunken rage or by drinking and driving.Should you have been aborted??? No of course not.What about crimes of passion where someone, because of shock, just loses it temporarily and kills or nearly kills someone else? Did aborting all those unborn babies with the psycho gene stop that? Nope.It's called being ""fallen in a fallen world"" which is why we needed Jesus Christ to save us from our sins. You're not a Christian? Fine. But it's the truth. And no one can deny that if people actually lived the commandments that Jesus taught, then there would be far less crime. But that's the hard way, so let's just abort babies who haven't done anything wrong.Oh and btw, read about Pharaoh and Herod in the Bible. Both of them murdered hundreds of thousands of babies. What would have been the difference between those evil (psychopathic) men and the leaders of Korea if they had passed that law? Nothing.And while we're at it, why stop at unborn babies? Why not have every single man woman and child report for their psycho gene testing and kill everyone who has it?Oh NOW we've gone too far??Do ya see the problem with this entire premise yet??2) The other problem I had with this show was there literally was no one to root for. There was no good vs evil where good triumphs in the end.What's the point of that? Like the world isn't already so dark that we all need to be depressed after watching ""entertainment""?It's a hard pass for me.Btw on a side note it's really concerning to me how many people thought this was entertainment. *Sigh*As a suggestion, if you're at all thinking like me, maybe stick to other series like ""Flower of Evil"" or ""The Good Detective"" or ""It's Okay to Not be Okay"" or ""Beyond Evil"" or ""Glory"" or ""Vincenzo"" or ""Eve"" or ""Reborn Rich"" if you want good to win in the end.Anyway have a great day!",negative,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"So as I mentioned in the title the lead actors did agreat job.. but the writing of this show couldnt be saved just by these talented actors..
The show portray people with anti-social disorders and psycopaths as violent indivduals with a sole porpose, murder. Its scientifically wrong. Personally I dont think aproaches like this to mental disorders and illness benefits anyone.A lot of people may argue that its a sci-fi based show, but still the hinting to real life disorders is very strong.And even if it wasnt... the ideas and solutions its suggesting are very weak. Like lets say they manage to eleminate the (psycopathy gene) which is a very radical way of handling stuff in the first place, but yeah even if they do so. It just doesnt solve the bigger problems like poverty, war and crimes that anyone is capable of doing it. So it just didnt make any sense to me.....The show is very intertaining though, if you ignore the ""scientific"" aspects to it. The actor Lee Seung-gi (Jeong Ba-reum) is extremley taleted there is no doubt in that. Also. Lee Hi Joon (Ko Moo-chi), Kwon Hwa-woon (Seong Yohan) very very talented.

there's always a card at play and it keeps us engaged till the ep ends.Also if you decide to watch it , good luck

It never truly picked up that spark it had in the beginning (although i still enjoyed it), once the plot twist of Ba Reum being the killer was fledged out more i really enjoyed what they done with his character but i can not see it as development because it is just Yo Han's brain doing all the work and without that brain Ba Reum would still be the same monster which makes it shocking that in the finale they make it out that he was a killer because of the gene and its not really his fault he is like this!!! Bong Yi's conclusion is awful, having flashbacks that Ba Reum is different is silly HE KILLED YOUR GRANDMA AND HAS ONLY CHANGED BECAUSE ITS JUST A DIFFERENT GUY'S BRAIN! Just messy, i didn't care for the knot murders (thought i'd add that). The show has some great pieces of dialogue and is shot AMAZINGLY but these parts where i had clear issues is where it hurts the rating from being great to just a borderline 7.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
tt13634792,"The series is just too good. So much emotions that will keep you entangled throughout the series. Never expected such plot twist. And WOW! What an acting. I'm a fan of Lee Seungi now. He's done an incredible job. Cried so much in the last episode. He's done a commendable job especially in the last episode where I couldn't hold my tears back and finally forgave the character. All other actors also done a splendid job. It's a bit ruthless and one need to be empathetic and emotionally strong to go through this series. So I understand it's not for all may be because there are lot of blood and violence going on in this series. But if you can bear to face the ruthless real crime world and understand the sci-fi, then you'll be able to understand and handle this series. Scientifically many things that were shown as sci-fi are very accurate in this series. So, it's a 100% recommended series.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"No the series is not dark, I blame the mum who assumed and saw him as a killer and she gave him up while adopting another's kid despite that kid having same gene. It's heartbreaking when he revealed to her that he had no intention of burying his brother back then. He was discriminated against right from the start by both mums, he was triggered and pushed into becoming a predator after seeking revenge for losing his adopted family. I've not seen a series with so much clever twists before. I can't predict who and what, because the plot twists were laid out very tightly to confuse me every step of way. Very well done.To me, the insightful part of this series is the play on a person who loses his memories, how he carve a new self image, borrowing from flashes and fragmented past memories and from what others describes him to be. The murderous part of him would possibly be hidden from him forever. Remembering the truth of his past sins and going into full remorse mode is only necessary in this sci-fictional and logical series. Makes you ponder deep on what makes a person, is it his genes, his memories, his past, his plight or his conscience. Eventual killing of his dad in prison gives necessary closure but also reminds us that the system is sending a repented former murderous self who is now gone.. to jail. The genuine struggle he displayed by killing his dad demonstrated that . It's philosophical and very deep. It's challenging and surfaces what might actually be wrong at every part of this series. It's not just about twists .",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

The Koreans are producing some outstanding films and TV shows and The Glory is a shining example of this.This is the first Korean TV series my wife has seen and with the last episode still to play out, she is already a fan of them.The Glory achieves exactly what you want from a TV show like this... something you look forward to watching at the end of a busy day. It's so engaging that we have been watching 2 to 3 episodes each night, with almost no distraction from our mobile/cells phone.The story its self has several levels to it and goes deeper than what I was expecting... and where I would normally expect a twist (had it been an American series) The Glory show catches me off guard by playing out exactly as it should do.The sole reason for removing 1 star is it does feel a little drawn out at times, but oddly, it also works as at no time did I feel bored watching it.As a result The Glory comes Highly Recommended!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Here she's poignant and dark due to her character's constant bullying in high school. You'll only see her smile after 20 minutes into the 2nd episode and laugh after mid 5th episode. Yeah, that's how bleak The Glory is.And season finale, 8th episode was a cliffhanger. Season 2 will be aired on March 2023.

Humanity warmth and thoughtfulness inadvertently and naturally reveal when DongEun and the maid meet.

tt21344706,"I won't add any spoilers, but what I will say is that there are very uncomfortable scenes with violence that I think caused some people to rate this drama lower than it should be. If you can push through it, trust me that it's well worth your time. I binge watched part one and part two as soon as they came out.The character plays a woman now in her mid-30s who wants to seek revenge on her bullies from when she was 18 or 19 years old. Those bullies who are part of a clique of mostly rich students, picked on less fortunate students with brutal results. They were simply allowed to continue doing this and their behavior was overlooked by teachers, the authorities and even the parents of those who were bullied. What I also find interesting as a side stories of the male lead, and the other women who were all bullied.I won't reveal more of the plot, because I think it's important for you to watch every single scene, don't miss anything. Rewatch it if you need to, all 16 episodes but open your mind, and see beyond violence.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

My respect for Kim Eun-sook, she didn't shy away from antagonizing the main characters because truly, you reap what you sow. The only thing I wish they'd done differently was to cast someone older for Joo Yeo-jung for a more balanced pairing with Song Hye-kyo, because let's be real; she had more solid chemistry with Jung Sung-il as Ha Do-yeong than with Lee Do-hyun.

There's an underlying message as in all Korean tv/movies about how class rules society shown as how a young Dong Eun has no one to turn to because of her lowly standing and her perpetrators are giving free rein due to their parents wealth and standing in society.The tension build up and complexity of the characters makes you care what is going to happen something a lot of series forget to do these days.The acting is superb especially by Song Hye Kyo who plays Dong Eun,she manages to play her anger frustration and sadness brilliantly.But the real showstopper for me is the little girl who plays Ye Sol...she steals every scene she is in I could watch her all day!!!!!Well worth watching and cannot wait for march and part 2.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Comes off as dead inside, no anger or sadness or joy. Just dead. Not great for a revenge story, but some moments are saved by her veteran acting skills.Main character's love interest is a 27yo, acting the role of a 35yo, but comes off as immature & shallow as an 18yo. He's a stereotypical teenage girl's crush: a doctor & a bad boy who gets into fights, empathetic & loved by his patients, from a good background & willing to kill for his love interest who doesn't reciprocate any kindness.

Now, I'm beginning to think the latter were either fake or from people with very low standards.This show has nothing but clichés and an unrealistic script to offer. It's slow and filled with useless scenes and dialogs. Really, it's your typical K-Drama, shallow but shiny.It does shine indeed but only in vanity. None of the characters have redeeming qualities. They're either murderers, would-be killers or violent criminals. All that, very casually!Quite surprisingly, the episodes are long but nothing meaningful ever really happens and the plot never seems to progress. So, my advice: do not waste your time!",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The best revenge is when the person ends up digging their own grave. Moon Dong Eun is literally a master of strategy and orchestrating a revenge that sees these monsters taking each other out. What makes this so satisfying is that she uses their own acts of violence and cover-ups against them. In short, this may be one of the best stories of revenge I've yet seen, in which the revenge actually does feel more like justice. Moon Dong Eun doesn't use acts of violence against them. She nudges. She prods. She pokes just enough to let them do the damage themselves. In some ways, the K-Drama ""My Name"" felt more like a revenge story than this one. That is not to say that ""The Glory"" is somehow inferior. It isn't at all. And because Moon Dong Eun is able to create justice-disguised as revenge-I didn't feel one shred of sympathy of those who ultimately caused and created their own downfall.This story takes bullying to an extreme level. Not necessarily one that is unbelievable. In today's world of bullying, it's sad that nothing seems to shock or surprise us anymore. The first half of the first episode is tough to watch as we see Dong Eun enduring horrendous torture as her nemesis, Yeon Jin, take great delight on burning her with a curling iron. It doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that Yeon Jin isn't a typical bully. She's a sadist, who is also very likely a psychopath. These days the terms ""psychopath"" and ""sociopath"" are now under the term ""Antisocial Personality Disorder."" Yeon Jin doesn't feel a shred of guilt or remorse for her actions. She smiles and even cackles with delight as she torments the girls at the school. Bullies rarely act alone, as Yeon Jin has five friends, including two boys, who also take pleasure in raping the girls. In short, these five people may be five of the most sadistic and diabolical bullies I've seen. Bullies are cowards, and it often takes someone of real strength and courage to fight back. By the time the first couple of episodes are over, you really can't wait to see what Dong Eun has planned.At first, Dong Eun's plans don't seem to be doing too much. But, ah! Just like the master tactician on a chessboard who moves his pawns to set up his other pieces, or in this series where the game of ""Go"" is used as means of illustrating Dong Eun's plans, we see that her plans are carefully thought out as she sets each one of the five perpetrators up. She's also like a master Judo or Akido fighter-using her opponent's momentum against them. In other words, she knows the weaknesses of each of the five and how to exploit them perfectly so that they end up actually fighting against each other. By the time the second season begins, you can't help but begin to marvel at Dong Eun and how she can weave such a complex tapestry to orchestrate a nearly flawless revenge!If Dong Eun has a blind spot, it has to do with her alcoholic mother. Just because you give birth to a child or make a child, doesn't make you a parent. Only a true parent raises their child properly with love and wisdom. And I found it a bit frustrating that Dong Eun gave in to her mother, yet again. But fortunately, she quickly realizes her mistake and rectifies it. No parent like that has any business being a part of their child's life. None.We quickly see how the rich and powerful believe that they are untouchable. Yeon Jin learns this at an early age from her own mother. And it's quite obvious that the parents of the other four were likely no different. Spoiling a child is also a form of abuse, but as I said, we don't feel sympathy for Yeon Jin and her sadistic cohorts! As each one of them falls, it's hard not to feel that sense of justice because that is exactly what it is. In some ways, the other four get off somewhat easily compared to Yeon Jin, but that's all right. Seeing Dong Eun speaking to Yeon Jin in prison was sheer perfection as Dong Eun gently smiles and outlines exactly how Yeon Jin trapped herself as well as the life she now has to look forward to. And the bully becomes the bullied as Yeon Jin now finds herself the target of her cellmates. Yes, justice is sweet!This series is definitely hardcore, compared to most K-dramas I've seen. It's dark, gritty, and it certainly doesn't pull any of its punches. The writer really illustrates the point that nobody gets away with anything. Ultimately, the truth will always come out and justice will be served.Performances in this series were all first-rate. I hadn't seen Hye Kyo Song since ""Descendants of the Sun."" I thought she did an incredible job of playing a character that was so different from the previous one. And I've been seeing Yeom Hye Ran in so many series lately! And that's good because she's an amazing and versatile character actress! She is fantastic at playing Dong Eun's sidekick and intelligence gatherer as follows the five around taking photos. I also loved how she played Yeon Jin-which was almost even more satisfying than what Dong Eun had cooked up! I was waiting for someone to smack Yeon Jin a couple of times!This series may not be for everyone, given its very dark theme, but frankly, it is a necessary one that doesn't try to dilute the effects of bullying. People have no idea how many children take that abuse into their adult lives-both physical and emotional. Isn't any wonder that Dong Eun has to take matters into her own hands when the judicial system, the parents, and the schools, fail to help protect them? It may have taken Dong Eun 18 years, but finally, justice is served!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"An 8 episode Korean revenge tale that anyone who has been bullied can relate to, The Glory is well done all around.I'm not sure how high schools compare Korea vs. America in terms of bullying, but as shown here, Korean teens seem super mean and cringeworthy. The main character, Dong-eun is picked on verbally, burnt with a curling iron by classmates, then slapped by school administrators. She drops out due to the abuse, then works menial jobs and studies to eventually go to university. All the while, she's plotting revenge on her high school tormentors.As far as I can tell, there isn't anything wrong with the technical aspects of this production, the script, dialogue, sets, editing are all great. By far the best aspect is the emotions The Glory May cause one to feel. As a poorer child, I wanted the rich, entitled girls to ""get theirs"".So well done.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Of course, the great actress Song Hyekyo stands tall amongst all of them for her micro expressive, cold and calculating character. But, even the little kid was really doing a great job and we felt raw emotions from all of them.Lee Dohyun got a bit sidetracked in the first few episodes, despite him being the male lead, but he is very prominent and integral during the second half. He was the heart and soul of the show where the energy is provided by Hyekyo. Their chemistry was very palpable as well. Overall doing a spectacular job as the cast.The director and writer must get along very well as the drama flowed very smoothly in a good pacing, without any fillers nor unnecessary characters. Even the camera angles and editing brought the highest of emotions to us.

tt21344706,"""There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either."" - Moon Dong-eunThe Glory is a South Korean television-series written
and executive produced by Kim Eun-sook, who molds a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high school violence who carefully plots her revenge against those that have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides a masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun. Narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must share was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seamlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how you reap what you sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.The series' weakness lies within it's predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as 'Lady Vengeance' and the 'Kill Bill' duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days. I am looking forward to the release of Part 2 with the conclusion of this potently written drama.IG: thecinephilereviews.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

tt21344706,"So the series starts well, as well as revenge story can go. After the first episode you find yourself both excited for some deserved belated retribution and horrified at what you've just witnessed. The plan is in motion, even if it takes 18 years.We are following Dong-Eun as she climbs step by step towards her revenge and all is well. She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.I hope the second part will be better. It seems like they are capable of very dark things and I got the impression that's where we're headed. I just found myself dissappointed at how muddy the middle part got and I really hope the script will be sharp and crisp for the next part.

Her character Dong-eun went through so much in her life that she would look visibly older than her old classmates. Having a hard life would age anyone faster, make sense. Anyway, fantastic drama and one of the best dramas of 2023. I fully recommend.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A masterpiece. I don't have huge detail to say about this series but I have to leave a review to say that everything about it is perfect. The story, direction, script, acting, music - all of it. Every performance is executed so well. Raw emotions are portrayed and felt intensely by the viewer. I think it is rare that a story actually delivers the justice that we as viewers want to see but here it is done so perfectly. Even when there is a set-back in the plan, it isn't a very big one, normally this type of story would involve too much of a one step forward and ten steps back trope, but in this case the right person is finally winning and it is so good!! Highly recommend.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

tt21344706,"Great intrigue, suspense and everything else that kept me at edge of my seat. Love the story's twisting and turning that just draws the viewer deeper and deeper into this dark story. The writing is brilliant - super plot - with tense turn after tense turn after tense turn. One has to pay attention, but unlike US made dramas, that is not riddled with politics and social messaging, this tale is all mystery...nicely done. The acting - yikes - too good for Hollywood. Each character is so well portrayed - the bad are really bad and the good - well - maybe not so bad. Directing and producing both nail this baby spot-on, making for a none-stop pot-boiler where juicy surprises just pop around every corner. Remember the adage, when this hand is moving, you better watch the other hand; in this show maybe watch the feet too. Please, stay away from Hollywierd, this kind of entertainment is something I will always watch. I don't go for whiny, preachy vomit, just really good stories like this one. Thank you so much for this work of art.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"This is one of my favorite korean drama.The story is excellent, characters are intense, the acting is terrific!My favorite actress is Yeom Hye-ran, that performs the poor abused wife. I'm not an expert but I think his acting is far the best in this TV show.Also other actors and actress are excellent, the main character, performed by Song Hye-Kyo, is so intense.I liked very much the plot, the character design and the photograph of the scenes.The run toward the riff of the evil bullies make you stick to the screen and you cannot leave.I'm not used to binge a tv show, but in this case you cannot skip.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Maybe because I had such high expectations?Revenge stories are not my fav, admitedly. But I still sort of liked ""Again My Life"" and ""Itaewon Class"" is my second favourite drama of all times.So... Let's begin with what I liked.The lady who was beaten by her husband. She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.Ye-Sol's father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.I also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.What I didn't like.The music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.The acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That's it. I couldn't even hate or resent them. They didn't feel like real people.SHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn't feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn't care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other's throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.I remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.On the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn't relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.Come to think about it, I wouldn' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In ""Encounter"" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I'm not so sure now. She was exactly the same in ""That Winter The WInd Blows"". Maybe better in ""The Full House?""At any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.Ah. If there is a third season. I won't watch. Not that there is anything to ruin. Just... Not interested.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The introduction was complete and good, so was the main part of the story. The ending could have been more but it was good as well. You have two people who have been through traumatic experiences and help each other while falling in love in the process. The whole revenge thing was so good and the lead actress scars and all still looked beautiful. I guess the moral of the story is be careful how you treat people because it can come back and bite you in a very bad way. I would definitely recommend this series as it keeps you hooked from the first episode to the last. The way she made them turned on each other was really wicked. A must watch series.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"There are a lot of great scenes and execution in this show. I loved that the show, for the most part, departed from the typical overly dramatic cheesy romance like many other dramas.That's where the show shines the most, when it's focused on the crime and suspense. The show starts off really well and pace really well past the midpoint where it becomes really sloppy.While I completely understand the motive of the lead woman, she's extremely boring, stone-faced, one-dimensional, and not very enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly all of the best moments are moments showing other characters. The dullest moments are those with her and her depressing obsessed doctor follower.Seriously? Even as cringy, annoying, whiny, and obsessed so many people are in most Korean dramas are, Joo Yeo-Jung takes the cake. His obsession and 'love' for Moon feels soo unnatural, out of place, and unwarranted it really waters down the rest of the show.I'd score the show two points higher if they removed him (or the weird awkward chemistry) from the main plot. He's like a real manifestation of plot armor for the main character in the form of a 'lover.'",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I mean the dialogue is awful with no depth at all. The acting is sometimes so childish, makes it really hard to watch it.Korean shows like to dramatise everything and in a really weird way.Every episode is so repetitive...we understand she got bullied in high school but the same scenes get constantly shown again. Some things just don't add up in this show. The rating people give is very surprising to me. Great concept but that's about it. This tv show would be better as a movie. Really don't understand the hype about. Don't waste your time on this show, there is so much better stuff out there.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Fast forward, she comes back and works as a teacher in the very same school she was bullied in and one of the kids is the daughter of Park Yeon Jin who was the leader of the group. The daughter is adorable and just pulls your heart strings. Moon Dong develops a plan and befriends Kang Hyeon-nam into helping her. Now Kang is a victim of domestic violence and part of the deal she made with Moon Dong is that she kill her husband.

tt21344706,"I loved the show, so spiritual, emotional, and definitely bingeworthy, I don't even watch kdrama but this had me hooked on the first episode knowing what the plot was. Especially since I can relate a bit. Being bullied is never fun but its never something you want to bring back up when you're already grown up and growing out of that ratchet life. I used to play Gomoku w my bestfriend and watching the show makes me want to go back to playing the game. It's really a mind game. The actors on this show btw will deff have you attached just saying. The relationship she grew w the grandma tht was helping her out was so cute the bond they grew together 😭😭😭",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Very good actors, very good plot...not the kind we are used to. Every single contributor did what he had to do and made a huge success of it. Even the music is well composed. It is available on Spotify. Not easy to remember the names sometime. But not so difficult neither as the story is well build up. First time I looked for other Korean movies and series because I am surprisingly very fond of The Glory. Worth watching it.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"***SPOILERS***The best Kdrama I have ever seen! Not a straight ""I was bullied years ago and want to take revenge now in my adult year"", none of that easy and flat stuff.This Kdrama layers down so much that every second, scene and every interaction that is shown, is crucial and important. Miss one scene and you've missed a lot. Since I've watched this like four (!) times already, I've come to notice scenes which, because of the heaviness of the topic, I missed in my first sitting. That I thought, why are they showing this particular scene? That, once you connect the dots, you'll be blown away by the creativity of the writer and the director. That you'll be amazed and want to see more of how the story will unfold.A unique topic, since I've said, this is not just a basic and flat revenge; it's mastering the art of taking over the power back from the abusers, to be calculating, to just simply wait for when to strike. Even if it takes years. To actually step up and announce to the perpetrators that you will be back for them. That you realise that taking your own life is too easy. Why not make them suffer like they made you suffer? Wow!!!This drama also shows this twisted relationship the main character, Moon Dong-Eun, has with her main bully. She even writes the main bully letters as if she was confiding in a best friend, but this is far from a close friendship; she hates her bully to the core and narrates eerily how she feels, how bad she wants to destroy the whole group who has tortured her, molested her and made her teen life a living hell. The hell she still is in during her far adult world; a scarred body that reminds her daily what she has been through. The triggers that bring her back to the very moments she felt excruciating pain.Every step Moon Dong-Eun takes, is set back in a brilliant contrast with the game, Baduk/Go; slowly winning territory from your opponent and bringing them down, one by one. Layering a perfect trap to take sweet revenge.The main bully, in het adult years, is living a beautiful life with a handsome husband and cute daughter and in no way ever thinks of her victim Moon Dong-Eun ever again. Until she's confronted by her and she realises just how messed up the web is that Moon Dong-Eun has spun for her.Please, do watch this and do not be discouraged to watch when some reviews say that it's slow, dull and so on. Those reviewers do not understand that simply taking revenge is brainless and will be just another show. This is art and is shown that way. Appreciate the art to understand this master piece. I've read some comments here that are disappointed with this drama but then I assume they've watched it with only half their attention. Doing that will make every drama a disappointing experience for sure. So take your time to understand this master piece. Watch this drama attentively; the scenes since every part is important.Make no mistake, the bully scenes will break you, make you angry, especially since some of the scenes are based on true events (the burning on the skin). But you'll be blown away by the performances and the stark resemblance of the young actors and the adult actors. That the younger actors also portray their part perfectly.Obviously, some people simply do not like the main protagonist, played by Song Hye-Kyo. But even if you're not a fan of her acting, you must admit that she totally nailed this part. She's also been receiving raving reviews about her performance, and that from US Forbes Magazine to Asian media critics. Finally, Song Hye-Kyo shows the world that she's capable pulling off this difficult character with such ease and grace. And, very realistically. She basically gives acting lessons and this is only season one!Her performance is spot on! She oozes every emotion one can have when they've went through what her younger character went through. She exhausts herself every day, punishes herself to not laugh and have a good time, since she's afraid it will distract her from her revenge. She hates her body and her scars. The empty look in her eyes show that she's broken from the inside. I've never seen such emotion shown in reel.Fun fact; there's a scene in which she's showing her body and her scars to the male lead. This has lead to controversies, since some netizens don't like her body (the most stupid thing I've read; everyone is beautiful!!). This is simply ignorance, since the whole meaning of that particular scene is not to just simply show her body to anyone because she feels like it; she finally opens up to someone who she feels can be her swordsman. To do the actual execution for her, to actually kill for her. To convince him that her revenge is just, that she can't just simply forgive and forget while the whole world just stood there and did nothing (actual crimes she's experienced!). I think this is the most intimate and beautiful scene I've ever seen.Season one ended with a major cliffhanger and actually the body of her revenge all set; I believe season 2 will be the actual execution of her revenge plan.Can't wait to watch the second season.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I believe the way the first season has developed the main character until she gets her revenge is unimaginable and unique, although I stand up to the chance that she'll be alone in the end, while the rest probably will be either dead or in prison. Her love interest is also an incognito and probably will have lots of struggle until he gets better from his mental illness and get involved with Dong-Eun romantically, also, his father's killer is a huge problem for him to surpass his shocking fellings, especially during his letters. That's why I give a nine star for the first part, even though I don't know how the series will proceed after the opening final.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A forbearance and revenge spanning many years also reflects the contradictions between the capitalist class, campus violence and the ugliness of human nature. The rhythm of the whole play is well controlled. The script is silky, full of tension and excellent in appearance. Through the positive description of the countless violence suffered by the protagonist and the scenes of scarring his body many times across the time latitude, the anger and helplessness of the protagonist and the cruelty of the perpetrators are more forcefully highlighted, which brings greater shock to the audience, and also makes the audience more deeply aware of the seriousness of campus violence and the harm it brings to people. Metaphor is used in many places, which adds artistic color to the film.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I have enjoyed a handful of K Dramas over the years and Parasite is a favorite movie of mine. This particular drama misses the mark though, which is disappointing because the premise is fascinating. There is just wayyyy too much filler and unnecessary scenes. This could have easily been only 8 episodes and my opinion my have changed; however 16 was just far too many and there are episodes where you might feel like giving up on it entirely. If you're looking for a summer series out of boredom, give it a shot, but don't blame me for being bored and wanting to scream: OK, get on with it already!!",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

I was sucked in after the first episode and could not stop watching until I saw every single one of them not going to bed till 5:00 in the morning. I was praying it will end and I'll be over in the 8th episode but then it was a cliffhanger and leaving me wanting to figure out what happened and I having to wait till March 2023!! I've never left a review for a TV series before but I had to cuz it was so good!!This series is definitely worse you watching you will not be disappointed. The acting was great the music is great the cinematography is awesome Suspense is good it was just overall super entertaining.,positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.I won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.If this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.However, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.But I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I really don't know what I keep missing here with Kdramas. I've seen 3 in total that I enjoyed, and this is not one of them. The whole premise is cathartic, a bullied girl getting revenge on her attackers. But the same issues I've encountered with other Kdramas hold here: firstly, WAYY too drawn out. 16 1 hour episodes is wayyy too excessive for something that could have been told as a two-hour movie. The main antagonist girl is a ridiculous overactor (she'd be at home in Jdramas) and the main character tells sooooo many people about her revenge plot it just becomes absurd. I mean it's not the worst Kdrama I have seen but it is still meh, I wouldn't recommend it.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Not to mention particularly overall casting did a fine stellar performance in elevating this kdrama to a new line of cinema....
Definitely thought provoking with a simple word ""BULLYIN"" and developing a plot with intense series of raw emotions & flawless screenplay is adorable...
The best part is that all the confrontation scenes in every episodes sends a spine chilling moments that tests our patience to wait for season 2

tt21344706,Highly recommend. Can't wait to watch season 2. Song hye kyo and lee do huyn are the reason I'm watching this movie. But after I watched it the movie attracted me every minuets. They have so many plot twists that made me can't stop watch it. People said the movie reborn rich is the best movie but to me this movie is way better. The reborn rich I have to drop it after first episode but this movie I finish it in a day. I'm not type of revenge movie but i watch it second time while waiting for next season. Watch it you won't regret it for sure. Hope they have more season then just two. After all highly recommended.,positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The Glory exceeded expectations! This is one of the rare kdramas that managed to start off with a strong captivating story and held that pacing to the very end. There was zero wasted scenes nor any dull/draggy moments.The acting in this drama was top notch! Soon Hy-kyo was solid in her performance of someone with hidden pain (physically and mentally). Lim Ji-yeon, Cha Joo-Young were so perfect in capturing the very duality of two-faced characters. At times I couldn't even hate Lim Ji-Yeon's character because of the depth she went to to capture the evilness of the character. Yeon Hye-ran was probably my favorite as Mrs. Kang as she manages to put some humor into an otherwise very painful story arc. When she was eating in the car and laughing at a news forum, that was such a pure moment for that character.The pacing is fantastic. Never once did it let up on its suspense and mystery. It kept hold of it's suspense through a well executed plot that uses each scene to present a piece of the puzzle and wastes no time in long drawn out expositions.Also the cinematography, camera angles and editing are worth noting. The scenes are cut in such a way that it uses a theme to lead into one another using a very artistic flare. IE a candy wrapper, that we believe to be from Mrs. Kang's bag, floating across a parking lot to the feet of another character but at a different moment than we expected. Many small elements like that sprinkled throughout the show to give you subtle hints using cuts, props, set dec pieces .Overall THUMBS UP! Do check it out!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Strong first half but weak second half.Loved the concept and how the series started.Typical revenge story where the main lead swears vengeance to her school bullies and supposedly prepares for decades for the perfect moment to attack.While the premise is very electrifying and filled with very strong and emotional scenes, I was kinda disappointed with how the events where unpacking. Somehow I was expecting a more intelligent, cold and calculated plan. I was hoping for that explosive element of surprise but never came.Dont get me wrong, still a very well written script, there were no holes and the execution was impeccable. I just have seen better revenge dramas.But still amazing thrilling and powerful series to watch. Loved how it's bending traditional morality and values and Enjoyed very much how the compassion many dramas force into good traditional characters wasn't implemented here. I strongly believe bad people don't deserve forgiveness and I was thrilled to watch the lead's punishing every single one of those devils.I did enjoy the romance between the leads ( although this is not a focus key in the story) , who became accomplices fighting for a justice that nit always has to come from a legal perspective but more from a peace of mind emotionally speaking.I read a lot about these incidents happening in schools and It breaks my heart watching some of the scenes recreating all the tortures and bullying ( to the point I had to put my tv in mute) but it's necessary we see them so we can try and change the wicked society we live in.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

The use of light and dark to tell the story, it's so clever. The editing is amazing, just infallible production.There is no filler, no drawn out episodes that go nowhere, there isn't a single moment of wasted time in the series. This is such a joy to have these days.

Assault is a crime no matter the age or the perpetrators' roles whether directly attacking, or making the attacks possible. Rather than the numerous drama series showing the criminals attacking other students always with impunity, expose physical and verbal assault in the school system for what it is: a crime punishable by expulsion and imprisonment.For the victim to become obsessed and as vicious as the criminals-while understandable-makes her no better. I am still waiting for a brilliant writer like this one to stop the histrionics and go after the criminals and their supporters carefully and methodically and legally until they are expelled and imprisoned. Because it never should have gone as far as it was allowed. And it won't stop until it is exposed and punished in the courts. That said, everyone in this drama is excellent.

It makes Korean films so unique and so brilliant in immersing you into the emotions and this series does so well in how each character and scene express the atmosphere of the circumstances and situations that are around them.I am required to fill this all up but i have no other way to just say how great of a series this is to binge.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"This is a ""revenge"" movie, and be forewarned, revenge is not terribly satisfying. A poor second to forget and move on.The overall mood is somber, and some pretty gruesome stuff takes place. The main character was abused (really awfully) as a minor, and becomes highly focused upon retribution once she becomes an adult. She is adroit, a careful planner, and basically sets the predators up to trip over their own vicious natures and their proclivity to turn adversity into aggression including upon each other.The story is not told in a linear fashion. Stuff happens, Then some backstory that proves illuminating and often surprising. And then again, and then again. It is engaging to never be completely sure you've got the full picture, and see your ideas of events get switched about.If you are in the mood for a bit of puzzlement and ready for a grim take upon life, this series will work for you. It moves along, and has interesting performances. It will leave you feeling that although there are good people in the world, you had better be ready for bad apples, and they are found in all walks of life.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Trails off and dulls!!! My goodness this show became annoying. At first I was rooting for the main character but as the show went on she became highly unlikeable. Note to Netflix: viewers like characters who still have some humanity left in them. Who can feel, laugh empathize smile and show emotions. Although the main character was bullied and I can understand why she would become hard later in life, by gosh she was so stiff and straight it became annoying. I haven't even finished yet and not sure if I will but please if writers can correct this, it will keep viewers coming back. Also I refuse to believe that grown adults still behave so grotesquely ALL THE TIME everyday towards one another. 5 stars for starting off good and then becoming annoying.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Great drama. Like we get so much emotionally connected that we tend to feel the pain and get that what the victim is suffering.It is also a good love story which is so rreaall. Many of the reviews here are about first 8 episodes because they released first 8 at once and took almost more than a month to release the other 8, almost like another season but were released under the same.First 8 episodes went like it was just 1 episode.So smooth and interesting series.Story is all about the revenge of botb the leads..but obviously only 2/16 for male, rest for the female.Executed very well, was great and got it when I lost interest in kdramas because of their constant and dumb storylines of some series I have gone through before The Glory.Go for it.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Like I know it's coming and super happy season 2 will be out in a few months because I got SOOO invested in this story I was ready! I guess though making us wait really does add to the slow burn that this show is all about. I mean 18 years she was planning so should've known this wouldn't go quickly. I think the acting is good! I mean sure revenge is a story we've all heard about before but I always like when they get creative. I feel like the next episodes will be just that. I also have no doubt we'll get to see everyone get just what's coming to them, along with answers to some burning questions! Easy to watch. Don't have many complaints. Keeping their names straight was the hardest part for me haha. Because sometimes they use all 3 and sometimes just 2, I just pulled up the cast on here and looked at the face if I got confused...so thank's for that IMDb.Part 2 did not disappoint! We got to see all the revenge plans come to fruition. Kept me guessing and had several surprises. Ended so well because it could absolutely be completely over and filling in the blanks wound be easy.

tt21344706,"Usually in revenge stories where the victim lays out an elaborate plan to exact revenge years later, the protagonist would hide his/her true identity and motivation until the climax of the story when he/she is ready to strike the final, lethal blow on his/her perpetrators. In this case, despite being poor and powerless, our heroine has the guts to confront and taunt them face-to-face, ""your time is up"", with a deadly cool smile that sends shivers down their spine. If this is not class, I don't know what is.This is modern Korean thriller at it's best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters. A much more efficient approach certainly but the drama would be over in one episode... Here we get to watch each move our heroine makes like the Go master she is evolving into, making small wins one after another. But will she ultimately prevail? And if so at what cost? Will she be able to heal her scars one day? Can't wait till part 2!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

I cannot wait for season 2 and I oftehn think of this show.But it has a huge flaw:
Season 1 is not complete. There is no wrap-up of the story, not only that not all questions are answered, but there is at least one major plotline being introduced. And that is done in a way that it may suggest there will be more than 2 seasons. This may not be all that bad, but streaming spoiled me, I'd rather binge than wait for months or years for continuing one story.Also, in past few months I also liked and enjoyed two other shows (Yellowjackets, From) whose stories are just cut in half and we need to wait for next season.This is a trend, but I really don't like it.The Glory?

You were drawn to the next episode, and I also felt that this series provided a great opportunity to show the talents of the actors more, especially the actor Jong Song Il. I think it is time for him to take on an absolute starring role in an upcoming drama. I removed a star from my restriction because of the scandalous and bold scenes.

This series is a prime example that changes in the school system, at home and with law enforcement are necessary. Shaming and expulsion, fines and no chance at a future at this school, are needed.

tt21344706,"This may be a subversion of the typical revenge thriller, but it feels a bit derivative since ""Promising Young Woman"" already did that. It's still very different, but it still feels trite. Not to mention, it can tonally lean a bit hokey and over-the-top, which I'd be all for if it were intentional.Most of it has to do with the fact that every character feels like a caricature. The bullies especially lack any dimension or complexity, but it's an even bigger sin that so does the main character, Dong-eun. Yes, her coldness is forged from trauma, but she's so one-note about it that those moments of levity with her love interest or the abused mother character don't land.So far I'm 10 episodes in and I'm finding it rather difficult to slog through the rest. I'm sure the writer found some elaborately clever, if not reaching way for Dong-eun to exact her revenge. I'll give it 5 stars for now, and if I care to finish, I'll add or take away a star depending on its ending, but I will not be recommending this to anyone...EDIT: just watched a recap and

There is a lot of time spent on building up the main character's backstory so the actual show doesn't gain traction until about episode 4. Unfortunately, this is where the plot runs into a bit of confusion with multiple characters, intersecting plots, and although the main character narrates some scenes, as a viewer I had to rely on plot summaries to explain everything else in scenes she wasn't in. Even with English subtitles, I still had to rewind to properly catch reactions to certain scenes.

Young actors are way too good, and I think they're one of the big reasons this show is great.I was shocked when I read that this is a real story and the real person committed suicide.I've been watching men's revenge movies my whole life, and women's revenge is way better than men's revenge. The story has a lot of small details that make it powerful and interesting.The young evil actress Shin Ye-Eun is extremely talented, charismatic and good to the point that I wish she acted in both roles. Song Hye-Kyo was average in that role and no chemistry between her and Lee Do-Hyun.Yum Hye-Ran was excellent and her story was very emotional.The end of the revenge was a bit too easy and boring.

tt21344706,"After watching the whole series, my impression is somewhat better than after the first eight episodes. Also, it is clear that although there are many inconsistencies in the story, especially in the police investigation, the whole plot should be seen primarily on a symbolic and metaphorical level. The relationships between the characters are well developed, and it is especially impressive to see how the characters themselves change as the story progresses and find themselves in new situations. This is especially true for Ha Do-Young.The ending is a little melodramatic, but it fits well since the whole story is quite painful. Also, there is too much mixing of plot from different time periods which just makes it harder to follow.All in all, a good series that is certainly not for those who want to watch something along the way for fun, but it is a good display of different characters with a special emphasis on evil people (that's the majority) who are irreparable until the end. No one had the slightest remorse for what they had done, but only felt sorry for themselves and looked to get out of their own problems regardless of who they hurt.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge! (I cannot understand why she is doing something like that rather than living her life peacefully? )The awful script continues with main actress's plan. To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.Moreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.Last but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.I still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it.

tt21344706,"9.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2022/2023 South Korean psychological thriller with revenge as a primary driver for the main character. There are 16, 47-72 minute episodes in two parts. The first part comprises the first eight episodes which is primarily where the revenge is set up. The last eight episodes center around enacting the revenge.First I provide a unique synopsis then I review.SynopsisThe entire story consists of multiple instances of true life bullying and revenge incidents. It is all based on true occurrences but not all of any one but rather elements of multiple true occurrences all melded into one. It is representational of the full range of bullying and provides an example of the most extreme cases. In this story, Moon Dong eun (Song Hye kyo) survived her school years most likely by dropping out of school at a critical moment to survive the bullies. Others that were targets of the same group of bullies were not so lucky. Her entire life after that is centered around earning enough money, and putting herself in the correct position to exact revenge on those that caused such suffering and misery. She bears the permanent physical and emotional scars of the actions of this bully group. She becomes a teacher and steers the situation so she is assigned as the homeroom teacher of the leader of the bullies', Park Yeon jin's (Lim Ji yeon), daughter. From that position, which puts her in close contact with her targets, she plays out her revenge. By fate or chance she meets Joo Yeo Jeong (Lee Do hyun) who falls in love with the troubled and mysterious Dong eun and offers to help her after seeing and learning the horrible things that were done to her. Kang Hyeon nam (Yeom Hye ran) is a housekeeper in the home of one of the subjects of Dong eun's interest. Heyeon nam catches Dong Eun collecting and going through the garbage for clues and strikes a deal for mutual benefit. Dong eun is at first unwilling to accept the true friendship and caring from others as she is so damaged from her past. But as she widens her circle of supporters to help in punishing those who were not punished by the adults at the time, she begins to heal emotionally. Karma is coming to those that bullied helpless and innocent victims in the form of Dong eun. Can she survive her own revenge?ReviewThis is hands down the best revenge show I have watched. For anyone that has been bullied or been in an environment where there are lots of bullies, this will definitely resonate. For me those parts were hard to watch because I am an empath to begin with but also because I was involved in a situation where I was minimally bullied where someone else was bullied so severely it drove them crazy and they wound up on drugs, out of their mind, and ran over a bunch of people on a sidewalk and they are now in prison. I did my best, when that was happening to protect that person but, as the show portrays, it is hard to effectively protect anyone when you are one of their targets. But that was not physical bullying like this show had where it was severe physical bullying with a psychological component.The acting in this is phenomenal by both those playing the bullies, the victims and just everyone. It does roughly follow where the first eight episodes (first half) sets the stage and tells about the past, and the final eight are focused on the revenge aspects. I delayed watching it because I wasn't sure how well I could take watching the severe bullying, as when something like that happens to you it is not something you ever fully forget or recover from, so I thought it might be too emotionally upsetting for me. But it is just mainly those first episodes and the way she gets her revenge is so satisfying.In sum, I highly recommend this for anyone that likes the revenge trope. I would rewatch it readily if it was on as there is a lot of depth to itSpoilersThe main detractors for me were some unnecessary things people did. I think what I liked the least was that the main bullies' spouse, who had been a very likable character nearly to the end, wound up murdering his wife's lover. The guy was a part of the bully group, and had done some horrible things, but that did not excuse him pushing him, now blind, off a building into a vat of cement. I did not want to see the little girl with her murderous mom, psychotic grandmother, nor her sociopath father and thought I would be glad to see her going with the father she grew up with, but he did that and I was like great she is still being raised by a murderer. I know they were alluding that he did it so the real dad would not continue to bother them, but that is no excuse to murder someone.The other senseless murder was when the girl that was the main bullies' assistant, finished off the injured, long haired, boy bully. It showed he had raped her and they all were obviously still bullying her, but murdering him by making that final blow took her from a sympathetic character to a person willing to murder someone when they were helpless. If he had been actively attacking her again I could have sympathized but it was not an act of self defense at that moment. It did not feel as good that the main bully went down framed with a murder she may not have committed. They were trying for an even deeper revenge, because of the irony that she is serving time for a murder one of her victims committed, but I thought there was plenty of opportunity for her to go down for the murder without turning the victim into a murderer. And it is based on true events, not a record of true events, so it isn't like that was the way it really happened.The other detractor, for me, was Do Hyun's suicide attempt at near the end. During the bullying, at her young age, it showed a suicide attempt and I think they were trying to show that suicide was always an option for her and now she accomplished her revenge why not? She herself should have known how much that would hurt Yeo jeong. I mean I would hope she would know how much that would hurt all of the friends she had, however reluctantly, developed. It is just such a selfish act I have a hard time sympathizing. And, if she had gone through with it, it would have reversed a lot of her revenge as her main bully would have used it as a way to vindicate some of her actions. Like see ""she was always like that."" I unfortunately know that is likely how that would play out as I spoke with the bully that drove the girl crazy and to prison and asked her about that incident and she pretty said ""I know isn't she crazy?"" It was apparent from the very gleeful way she said it, that she was pleased with the outcome and did not feel any personal responsibility for the end result. That bully group destroyed one life and was, in my opinion, partially responsible for the death and injury that person that was bullied caused.It would have been nice to have seen the main couple together longer than just the tail end of the last episode. Some say the romance element was completely unnecessary but I enjoyed the angel that two people with psychological scars can find healing in each other.I think they left it open for another season by showing the male and female lead enter the prison where it was apparent they planned to exact revenge against the person who murdered the male lead's father. And that wasn't a bad way to end it. It didn't wrap up that particular piece but that was okay because it wasn't what we were there for anyway. Streaming platforms like to keep the piggy banks open and often end things very unclear. In this case that one piece was not even completely unclear. We know enough about our main girl by now that we can be sure she will help him get his full revenge.#SongHyeKyo#TheGlory#LimJiYeon#LeeDoHyun.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Born on the wrong side of the tracks, high school girl Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo, Jung Ji-so) got brutally bullied by rich peers. Not just with the usual slapping, hair-pulling or public shaming, but with means that would leave lasting marks all over her body. After realizing that even the school administration not only could not help her, but would even join in the bullying, she dropped out. She worked menial jobs to get an education degree and save money towards a revenge plan.In the meantime, her bullies went on to lead comfortable lives - a famous weather forecaster of a broadcast station with a sweet daughter and a CEO husband, a golf course executive and his lackey, a famous artist, an airline stewardess and an awarded school administrator.The story is intense. The bullying is horrific, making me wonder whether Korean kids are really this mean, having watched similar bullying scenes in The Penthouse and other kdramas. However, I haven't gotten drawn into any character as much as I would have wanted to. And after watching a seemingly endless parade of revenge-centric dramas, I am getting bored with this plot device. I was actually surprised at how revenge-driven this is, making it rather archaic. Even Chinese dramas, known for revenge plots, are now depicting stories that advocate love, peace and forgiveness.With a protagonist that has so much hatred in her as to hatch such a revenge plan, I doubt she can really love anybody, thus, I find any ""love"" angle in this drama implausible.I am still giving this a decent rating as the revenge was done not only for the protagonist's sake but also to serve justice for the murder of another bullying victim, though it begs the question: did the protagonist use the other girl's death to avenge herself?",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,I watched it till mid of episode 7. Eventually I gave up the hopes of this series ever picking up the pace. It's so slow it's like watching the paint dry.

The guy who loves the lead actress is so stupid I can't even put in words.Episode 1 was really really good though. It gave me great expectations so I kept on pushing till episode 7.

It is also contrived in the way it resolves many situations.However, it is easy to forgive this when the acting is sooo strong (the main heroine and the main villain are amazing, but not only them) and the story manages to engage us so intensely, touching on essential societal issues (not only bullying and associated traumas but also social inequalities, corruption and relationships).Nevertheless, I still can't see how a second season won't be a case of diminishing returns.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Looking forward to Part 2 in March.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"This may be my first review on IMDb. Honestly, I just want to praise this show. I tend to be a 'tough audience' and don't watch a lot of tv, but I have not one complaint or nitpick about this profound watch. Not one episode I wished to get through quicker, in fact the opposite. It is genuinely one of the best shows I've ever seen. Clearly I have been sleeping on Korean drama. If you need some quality content to watch, please give this a try. Although the ending was PERFECT and nothing more is really needed, I would be elated to see it renewed. I don't even care if it's a new direction or a continuation of the original story, as long as the two main characters are in it. Amazingly done, Kim Eun Sook.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I am so happy to see that part 2 is coming in March 2023. We seriously cannot wait. South Korean dramas have a certain and great style. The cast in The Glory is sensational. The tension is real. The story is simple but still complex. It's interesting that the revenge plan has been drawn out for so long. Song Hye-Kyo is wonderful as the patient mastermind, who draws brilliant people into the plan. We love her. Go is an important theme for the series, and an important and vital analogy for everything that happens. Go unites players and through the game players form strong bonds. The principle of building houses is important and central. We love The Glory. The English dubbing was really well done as well.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A series that piques your interest at the start but gets you emotionally involved at the end.I was wondering what's wrong with the Korean society that people opt for suicide for bullying. I mean, you can just leave and move away. Report to the authorities and move on with life. Too much young and even older lives are wasted, whether you are famous or not. (It's a society that puts too much effort on respect, you have to be careful with your speech and actions when you visit their territory- or it's all just a facade!)But having watched The Glory (I can't believed i finished it in one day!), i saw and felt the victims anguished and how it tormented her for life. As much as I wanted to see her change and forget and have a life, I also wanted to see the perpetrators be punished- severely. It evokes emotions I thought I didn't have for such genre. The bullying scenes were necessary for skeptics like me to understand the depth of their agony.That's when I realized the actors, the storyline and the cinematography were so so so good. It's brilliant. Now I understand why Song Hye Kyo was chosen, she brought the character to life and she has done well. Her sneers and retorts make me cheer silently - hoping somehow it comforted the character although she will show she's in pain yet determined. She cunningly (yet also genuinely) made me fall for the character. The other characters were skillfully played that I just got invested with their next actions.Now, I can't wait for season 2.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I like the plot so far , theres a lot of backstory and also sometimes too many stories so I'm curious on how they will tie all this in.Firstly Kang Hyun really does have a significant role other then reporting to Dong Eun and waiting for her husband to die, so sometimes her screen time is predictable everytime she shows up.For instance Yeo Jung the doctor , I'm not sure what his story has to do with Dong Eun's other then being her headsman, but I'm sure he will be be the one in prison or doing the killing since he has a past trauma as well. They also show his father in jail , his father inmate number is his passcode to his house ; so I will pay attention to him In season 2.Other then all enjoy the show can't wait for season 2!",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Not only does the dubbing make the characters sound like a bunch of bratty valley girls in California, the lack of subs eliminates a lot of important cues from memos, tv shots, signage and so on. I'm still watching so not rating it just yet. It's no 10 but I'm enjoying it enough even with so much of the cultural info erased by this flub of a dubbing job.I've had some pretty brutalized students but no bully victims like Moon Dong-Eun. It's a bit inconceivable that injuries as extensive as those portrayed in The Glory wouldn't attract an intervention. Also, I used to teach at a national university training students on track to become secondary school teachers. The portrayal of the ease with which Moon Dong-Eun attains her teachers' certificate is facile in the extreme. It's bloody difficult to pass the test.",,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I very much enjoyed this surprising series... I knew nothing of it, or heard anything of it. I wanted to binge my way through it, and look forward to the next season that is coming in March this year. Its very dark at times.... and hard to watch the moments when the bullying is taking place in the high school, but shows you just how spiteful kids can be and can get into the minds of venerable humans who have little or no self esteem. Sadly, whats worse (spoiler alert) when you see adults behaving the same way, its even harder to watch but again, just makes it so hard to turn away. The lives of the wealthy are also exposed for the greed and though I found it hard to follow at times, it was worth the effort.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I have watched a few revenge shows and this one is definitely one of the best ones. It's gory, suspenseful and entertaining. The Glory follows a group of people who went to high school together and their complex relationships later in life. We see many flashbacks to their life in high school, mostly bullying scenes that are heartbreaking to watch, but executed really well. The acting in this series is overall really great, especially from the bullies, there's just something so raw and almost eerie in their delivery.The complex characters and their complex relationships are very interesting to follow. This series does a great job at making you feel momentary sympathy for certain characters, only to make you question that seconds later.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A revenge drama can be hard to watch. Especially if you allow the fact that revenge is a poor basis for justice to interfere with your going with the flow of the drama. This series largely avoids that problem through the nasties being agents of their own downfall. The victim seeking revenge does not kill or maim her targets. She manipulates them into doing that to each other.That is possible because the nasties are such awful people. Of course anyone who bullies to the extent they bullied the victim at school is likely to grow up to be an awful nasty, so I had no issue with that. More problematic for me was that they would continue as ""friends"" into adult life despite being so horrible to each other. Their constant abuse of each other was fertile ground on which the victim could sow sufficient discord for their group to implode.I also felt that one or two of the revenge outcomes were a little too easy - for example the death of the abusive teacher required little effort from the victim.The darkness of the storyline was partly redeemed by a love story - this is a kdrama after all! Gaining revenge did not give the victim her life back. She needed love to do that. If only she could have done it with the love but without the revenge.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Seeing all the promising reviews on IMDB and also since I was in the mood for a revenge thriller, decided to give this series a shot. The first episode was pretty gruesome and sadistic and it really set up the premise of revenge really well. But, the next 7 episodes after was just downhill. Introducing characters after characters, random plot lines and confusing scene edits and cuts. I was so angry that I invested so much time into this, that I tried to finish it, but stoped at episode 7, cos I couldn't take it anymore. The revenge plot is so slow and never picks up any pace. It's like watching paint dry. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS SERIES. It's a massive time sink with no pay off. Also, the young characters in the first episode were so good and then the odler characters, especially the main lead was so horrible from there on. So frustrated!!!",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The Glory is a 16-part Korean drama that we finished watching last week. The episodes run for between 47 and 60 minutes. The final episode is 71 minutes. It is the story of Moon Dong-eun, a woman who was brutally bullied by four rich girls in high school. The first episode is difficult to watch. Eighteen years later Dong-eun sets her plan for revenge in motion.Sometimes Netflix has a habit of stretching these shows into more episodes than are necessary to tell the story. That's not the case here. Moon Dong-eun's revenge plan has many moving parts, there is a lot of story to tell and many important characters to flesh out. A few episodes dragged a little, but most of them just zipped along.We watched The Glory with English dubbing and with the subtitles turned on. They were always in sync. People who know about these things have said that the translation was excellent.The trailers won't tell you much. The modern day portion of the story itself moves along more or less in a linear way but there are many flashbacks. Some scenes, especially in the final episode are shown out of sequence. I think it works. Some people have complained about how the girls were played by different actors in the high school scenes. At first it is difficult to keep track of the Korean names.The Glory is a dark drama with violence, an otherworldly amount of profanity and precious little comedic relief. In the final episode, near the 7-minute point, when Dong-eun says to one of her former tormenters, ""my schedule has opened up"", the viewer might feel like taking a really deep breath and letting it out.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Quite possibly my favorite tv series in the last decade! Brilliant writing, acting, directing, and can't wait for season 2. Totally believable story of a high schooler who was targeted for bullying (the bullies chose their targets, one after another) and ended up on the brink of suicide. The redemption of this story is unlike any other I have seen, it's totally believable, no plot holes, and the way the story moves is special. The actors are all worthy of their parts, and I got emotionally connected to the two leads exacting revenge. The revenge plot is well constructed, expertly thought out, and the finale is quite satisfying! The way that Dong-eun uses all her bullies to turn against themselves was brilliant and even better was the way she got Yeon-jin's mother to turn against her daughter. Must see!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"To be honest I did not expect anything at first 😌The first couple of episodes was a build up story. It tell show badly the main character got bully and it was BAD. I got so riled up. I was mad at the perpetrators like ""HOW COULD THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT??"" lmao
The main character was so good. The suspense, the lightning, the sounds.. I like it so much.I was waiting so much for the revenge part and It was GOOD. Finally. Yes, FINALLY they got what they DESERVED, one by one. So satisfying✨
Especially when her mom tried to guilt trip her!Tbh I was kinda scared that the main character would end badly after all the work she have done, like ""my job is done, lemme end my life here"" but thank goodness the doctor was by her side.For me, everything was good. Just the ending revenge kinda seems being a little bit rushed. But overall it was awesome.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

I wasn't taking it very seriously for the first few episodes, but eventually I decided to pay closer attention and oh my god I'm so glad I did. This show is so intricate and satisfying to watch. There are at least one or two huge moments per episode a la breaking bad, and I was absolutely locked in for every minute of it. I watched the last 5 episodes in one day because I just couldn't bring myself to put the show down. The pacing is immaculate and every single actor is putting on the performance of a lifetime. I genuinely can't think of one actor in this series that is bad or even okay. They are all incredible.

Near-perfect acting by all the casts (kudos to the casting) including the young version of Dong-Eun. You know the casts are good when you feel like physically going into the screen to slap them or hug them.One of the best revenge plots i have ever watched. So many moments of fist clenching, teeth grinding, anger fuming, tears rolling throughout the series. This series depicted the norm of the world especially the vast contrast of those who have wealth and power versus those in poverty and marginalized and even in both, there are bound to be light and darkness that seemingly have their own way of justice and i can just say that i am soooo satisfied with the justice that have taken place in this series, well, at least in my head.Wished there was an end beyond the ending towards the end but anyhow it has to end cause the plot was such that it has to come to end even when i don't want it to come to an end.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

This show was superb specially the story telling was extremely well, it's gripping and full of entertainment. Acting is top notch specially from the lead actor and actress.

tt30368332,"Lee Jung-eun is indisputably the highlight of this show! She masterfully (and adorably) portrays a lady in her 50s acting like she's in her 20s. (She is known to international audiences for her roles in Bong Joon-ho's works like Parasite and Okja, which showcase the physicality in her acting. She boasts a prolific filmography and is wellknown to K-Drama fans for her supporting roles in Mr. Sunshine and When the Camellia Blooms.)The show is a slice-of-life drama surrounding a prosecutor's office but, at its heart, is a slapstick comedy with a blend of romance and mystery. It explores themes of ageism, government bureaucracy, substance abuse, and social expectations.The show shines with its lighthearted and humorous moments, but it features a darker storyline, the murder mystery, that has become quite common in K-drama comedies (e.g. Behind Your Touch). So, it's a whimsical blend of dichotomies and contrasts.I couldn't help but be reminded of Kafka's Metamorphosis when considering the central premise of this show. The physical transformation provides an amusing but thoughtful commentary on ageism.Don't watch this for realism. As with many K-Dramas, enjoy the rollercoaster ride filled with both humor and heart.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

In the process, she gets scammed and bumps into Prosecutor Gyu, who is harboring a dark secret in his sleeve.ReviewWhat is the benefit of working so hard?This is the question Mi-Jin asks herself when she fails the civil service examination again. In her last ten years, she did nothing other than study for it. But all she got in return was to hear that she is in her thirties now, without any experience, so getting a job is difficult. Her best friend Chon Hui is her only confidante. Her never-ending plight takes an unprecedented turn when she finds herself in the body of a fifty-year-old woman every morning and only returns to her true self at night. In between a serial killer is on the loose.Helmed by Strong Girl Bong Soon director Lee Hyung Min, the story is a perfect blend of romantic comedy with a big dose of horror. Mi Jin is strong and has an effervescent attitude. Even in the darkest hour of her life, she chose to live. This is where director Lee plays his cards. He never makes the story monotonous and cold. In the process of looking for the serial killer, Prosecutor Gyu and Mi Jin form a bond and even find solace in each other. The journey of love is not cliche but resonates with the life of this genre. The mother of Mi Jin resembles Bong Soon- she wants to see her daughter settled and is unaware of her true condition. They are sweet but self-centric. A supportive yet spineless father and an unannounced second lead in the form of idol Jo Won make the tale intricate and intriguing.Reply 1997 girl Eun Ji is brilliant as the night girl Mi Jin. Her banter with her friend, feeling attracted to the charming prosecutor - the girl brings out all effortlessly as always. Lee Jin Eun as fifty-year-old Lim Sun- the alternate identity of Mi Jin is the twist of the tale. The woman who mostly dons the character of a helpless mother has brought out the invisible kitty from her bag. Her enactment of the twenty-eight-year-old in body of fifty is hilarious and melancholic. Jin Hyuk as prosecutor Gye is remarkable. The man is one of the versatile actors in the Korean drama case. He knows what he is doing. He is effortlessly hot and equally cold - which is needed for this dark role. The supporting cast adds humor mostly, but Byung Hee Ajushhi is the cherry on top.ConclusionKorean drama directors always do brilliant in bringing out supernatural stories. This Miss Day and Night is no different again. A fantasy element packed in delving into solving a cold crime case is not just magnificent but more than that.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

It's a kind of slapstick comedy and it's one of the funniest i saw in the last months.There is some kind of romantic involved which is kinda normal for every Korean show and it includes some social criticism as well. But it's not meant to be serious which gets more and more obvious.Her parents remind me somehow to the couple in Kung Fu Hustle. It's a very weird and funny couple and well played.

tt30368332,"""She is Different from Night and Day"" is a TV series that started off strong, showing how unfair life can be and the struggles of living in society. It was interesting at first, but then it turned into a cliché mess. The main character became annoying and made dumb decisions, making the story cringey and overly dramatic. The final straw for me was the ridiculous umbrella and egg scene, and I had to stop watching right there.

The idea is quite interesting.On to episode 2 , it is too dramatic and the female lead is too dumb to watch. The scene at the used bookshop are so staged it is wasting viewers' time, as if it is create there to stretch the time.The supporting characters are all useless characters, didnt contribute anything to the story. And they all try to be a joker which fails immensely.The female lead acting is boring. The male lead is the only saving grace, but is it enough to carry the show going forward? Ummm.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt30368332,"This is another drama where the female lead is an idiot. I've watched 7 episodes and she may have put together three coherent sentences. Tops! She mumbles and looks at the ground like a five-year old. I know with cultural differences this is more normal in Korea. But, she's coming off practically mentally challenged. There is zero reason for the romance if he's supposedly an intelligent prosecutor. Even if opposites attract, I can't imagine he's going to find love with a total mumbling fool. However, the older female lead is doing a great job so far! I wish she'd be the overall lead and he falls in love with her. At least the character comes off as a capable human being during her time. I don't really know what else to add. If you are bored and want to watch something silly and don't care that the lead is feeble minded, you can enjoy it. The side characters, mostly her parents don't help much as all they typically do is try to marry her off. His partner is really funny. I have seen him act in other dramas and he's usually good. But, he can't save this.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt32380398,"The wait from week to week for new episodes is so difficult because this drama is so much fun to watch. The main and supporting characters are endearing, there's a lot of comedy, the sets and filming are eye candy, there are healthy ideas about withholding judgment and second chances and having the courage to live the life you want, the female lead feels real and genuine like she could be any of us, and the male lead's voice and facial expressions just draw you in and keep you hooked. The ensemble works well together and has a positive energy that reminds me of the ensemble in CLOY. There are a lot of commonalities actually, so if you liked the interactions between the characters there, you will probably like them here too. Kudos to the directors of My Sweet Mobster for bringing all of that out from the cast.There are a couple of details that I didn't care for (the kitty villain's character is very off to me, and I didn't like that the female lead actually accepted to clean her colleague's home and especially didn't like the low-self-esteem, ingratiating way she conducted herself in that scene; I could have swallowed it if she had handled herself differently or had cleaned anyone else's home like a normal job instead of allowing herself to be used like that by someone with ungenerous intentions). But overall, this drama has been a very enjoyable watch and keeps us looking forward with much anticipation to each new episode. Yes, it contains lots of tropes and silliness, but in a good way that is entertaining. This drama is addictive and sweet like candy and will give you the same little boost that candy does.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Chaos starts as the lives of these three different people from different worlds meet.ReviewDirected by Kim Hwang Yoon, this soft romantic story goes through the lives of people who have faced criminal charges before. Ji Hwan used to be a thug and has been in the money extortion business. His connection with Prosecutor Yeong shares insight into the dark past Ji Hwan has been fighting to move ahead. This conflict between good and bad stirs the tale ahead. Eun Ha's hard work and achievement this afr melt away at one single mistake. Another content creator Ye Na comes into action which is a blend of positive and negative light.The biggest thumbs-up for the drama is that it is very much today's story. Eun Ha's journey reflects the turmoil of every content creator who is making money in this business. Han Sun Hwa as Eun Hwa is warm and vivacious. She is trying to understand the human Ji Hwan is and the life he has been into. The romanticism identified in this character is discreet which matches up with the graph of the story. Tae Goo, the man seen in critically acclaimed films has been debuting as lead for the first time. He is soft in heart and is a clumsy person who is trying to fit in the polished world. The Goo rubs off sweetness ever since his appearance in the tale. He is someone with a golden heart and the door of his house is open for all. The way the director distinguished between the two worlds adds subtle nuances to the tale, like thugs calling Ji Hwan Hyungnim instead of Hyung. The altercation between two universes is satisfying and humorous.ConclusionThe overall story is heartwarming and light. While dueling in the past, the story goes through a laugh and love lane as two charming hot heroes vie for the innocent-hearted girl.

Son Ye Jin is sweet and pretty and makes her character likeable and sympathetic - not annoying at all. Her range is impressive. The supporting characters are sympathetic especially the scoundrel Gu with a heart and seemingly cold fiance Seo Dan. The cute bunch of N Korean soldiers are all endearing and the evil and greed in the S Korean family members is painfully familiar.Hollywood hasn't been able to come up with anything fictional of this standard.

Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.6. A wealthy, beautiful but hurt woman who learns to love herself as well as others, who can be hilarious and sassy, yet who finds strength in loving and protecting the most amazing man-Capt. Ri.7. A beautiful man, a pianist who becomes an army officer, a quiet philosopher and tomato plant caretaker with a ""low voice""-the kindest man I believe I've ever seen in any narrative-who adores the hurt woman, knows who she is, finds her, protects her, and loves her no matter what evil, what danger threatens them. Yes, he sounds too good to be true. . . . .but he's not. The whole world is in love with Capt. Ri because Hyun Bin developed him and made us believe that such a man can exist.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

I was hooked by the first episode - the witty script, dialogue, music, songs, cinematography and the palpable chemistry not only between the leads but the whole cast - it really caught me pleasantly off guard!
I have and continue to binge watch - since mid february till now (first week of May), I have completed seven K drama series! Am on my eighth one now.
I do have a clear favourite actor - Hyun Bin and pretty sure, many other talented names will be added to this list.
In lockdown, good opportunity to get 'pop cultured'!",unknown,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,I liked these drama. I mainly watched this drama because of the high anticipation and reviews. But I don't think it's as good as dots or goblin.I liked the 2nd couple more than the lead couple. So I DON'T THINK the 2nd male lead had to die. There was no basis in his death. I mean the main lead took so much risks. He even escaped to another country to keep his girl safe and not a single thing happened to him.😆😆😆I also hated the fact that Gu seung joo's death was not mourned by any. Not even the lead actress(he was her ex fiance and helped her go back to south korea). I think his last death scene(where the seo dan was taken as hostage) was not well written. It seemed like the writer wanted to finish this as fast as possible.The humour was great especially after they(Hyun bin and his comrades) escaped to south korea. Tbh I really liked the 4 comrades. They were awesome. It's because of them I could complete this show.,neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

But I recommended him to be patient, if you like to write a story.Few weeks later, he texted me ""I am completely addicted to Crash Landing on You !! I blame on you!!!""

I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"I finally finished it, 16 episodes and more than 20 hours of total running time. I'm not a fan of Korean Telenovelas, but I decided to give this one a try because of all the hype and also I thought that anything related to North Korea should be interesting.And it turned out to be quite an amazing series. In fact the hardest thing I had to do was resist watching the next episode because once you start watching it, it's pretty hard to stop.I think the North Korean setting is what makes this series unique and great, and also what kept me going thru some cheesy scenes (this is, after all, a Soap Opera). The setting bought the viewers to an exotic, new place with strange customs, and at the same time allowed the ""Fish Out of Water"" Plot Device on both sides of Korea (a minor spoiler there).Aside from that the series is also very well made in terms of Script and Plot Twists. It initially starts out as a Romantic Comedy with incredibly witty, you-will-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing dialogue, and eventually evolves into a Soap Opera Thriller towards the middle of the season with clever Cliffhangers at the end of each Episode.The pacing is fast, there are always a lot of things happening onscreen, and the Cinematography is amazing, especially the scenes in Switzerland which made the place almost look like heaven.My only reservation is that is a bit cheesy at times as I mentioned earlier, and also a bit too wholesome for me, which made it feel a bit too unreal at times. I mean, no-tongue kisses, really?And no sex, despite all those gorgeous people sleeping around in each other's apartments? I think they just wanted the series to be as acceptable for as wide an audience as possible.Despite that, overall I would say that this is no ordinary series, it is much better than much of what I have seen on Netflix so far. I think it is an Instant Classic, a Masterpiece that must be seen. Truly outstanding.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"What can I say about Crash Landing on You that hasn't been said already? For starters this drama belongs to the Premier Division of k drama IMO, in line with Secret Garden, You Who Came From the Stars, Legend of the Blue Sea. Not entirely coincidental these dramas were aided by respectively the same actor, Hyun Bin, and the same screen writer, Park Ji Eun. The question remains: what's so good about it? I think it is the right mix of story, actors & music.The StoryCrash Landing on You combines many proven genres that capture a worldwide audience from the start: action, romance, comedy, drama, tragedy, business, rags & riches. Moreover it is meticulously written according to the golden rules of screen writing:
1. Use the time of your audience in such a way that they will not feel their time was wasted
2. Give people at least one character to root for
3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water
4. Every minute must either reveal more of a character or advance the action
5. Start as close to the end as possible
6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet your characters, make awful things happen to them to show what they are made of
7. Don't try to please the whole world, this only weakens your storyline
8. Give your audience as much information as possible in order to stay hooked.
The storytelling is also rock solid: boy meets girl - they get into trouble - things go from bad to worse - there is a closure but at the same time it keeps us from knowing if new developments are good or bad, hoping for a sequel.The ActorsEven well written stories are made or broken by the cast. In this case the acting of each and everyone was on point. I can't imagine any other actor playing the lead than Hyun Bin (the stern and sturdy North Korean army officer Ri Jung Hyuk) and Son Ye Jin (the sophisticated South Korean chaebol heiress Yoon Se Ri). Also the supporting cast did a great job, with honorable mentions for Yang Kyung Won (sergeant Pyo Chi Su who speaks North Korean to a T according to North Korean defector Kang Nara) and Bang Eun Jin playing the emotionally scarred mother of Se Ri.The MusicSo, we've got our story and the right actors, but the soundtrack is the cherry on top. No surprise this soundtrack leads the Top 10 of most downloaded OST's of ALL TIME at the moment I'm writing this review.RewatchSometimes I can forget a story as soon as the clue has been reached, but I think I will definitely rewatch this drama. There are many layers in the episodes that deserve a re-run.VerdictOverall, if you haven't seen this already, go watch it, and get in line with others who are longing for The Sequel.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"This is my first time reviewing - and this is my first time watching Korean drama TV show - something I never thought I would enjoy having grown up in Hollywood, but I am Super impressed! The 4 main characters are perfect in their roles, and the supporting actors were great! I love the build up from the first episode all the way to the end. It has cute interactions as well as heartbreaking ones, and just an overall enjoyable drama in Korean. I started watching other Korean tv shows but none of them are as well made as this one, I highly recommend this if it's your first time watching korean drama and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!The story is about a South Korean smart lady boss who happens to come from a wealthy family and meets a North Korean soldier after accidentally being swept away in a hurricane. Both actors were great in their roles, although I find the female actor Son ye jin a better actor, the male actor Hyun Bin is quite handsome and cute in his role. The supporting actors are all quite good and thought the director did a good job - especially with the build up of the story.

So I had to make an IMDB account in order to write a review to this surprisingly impressionable show. Maybe it will help my grieving process.The show is well balanced, and takes you through a huge reservoir of emotions. I've cried and laugh, felt fear and joy. At the beginning I wasn't all that sure. In the first episodes I thought the story seemed to predictable, and at times whimsical. But boy was I wrong. After two episodes I couldn't stop watching. I finished the entire series in three days.The main characters have captivating stories, and the actors are able to portray thoughts and emotions in a superb manner. Even though I couldn't understand the language, I felt like I could.The script is well written. There is no unnecessary dialogue, the character say what is needed. And nothing is over explained. The main plot has many layers, and I catch myself thinking back at different moments in the storyline more than once during the day. The side stories give you a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people in a country far different from my own. Even the seemingly dim neighbors get a special place in your heart. The acting is superb. The mimic of some of the supporting actors seem a bit dramatic at first, but somehow it just fits. Everything feels natural, something that is often lacking in Hollywood productions. The main cast are able to give us a nuanced portrait of human emotions.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop here. All I wanted to say was: WATCH IT.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

Every single character was compelling with their own unique personalities and characteristics.I'm a huge fan of kdramas, but I'm convinced any casual lover of TV would LOVE this show. It's not too cheesy like some Kdramas and it was VERY well produced with a beautiful score and cinematography.I have to give them props for the realism of the portrayal of North Korea. The North Korean characters felt like normal, everyday people and weren't vilified or ostracized just based on their nationality.I don't want to spoil too much of it, but I will say that at first I was bit upset about the ending but it was so well executed that it's grown on me and I'm satisfied with it.I DO want to talk about the elephant in the room-the main leads' acting. Oh my lord, they are PHENOMENAL actors. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are some of the best actors I've ever seen-topping most western actors easily. Son Ye-jin's crying is so convincing and doesn't across as faked or forced. And you can really feel how much Jeong-hyeok loves Se-ri thanks to Hyun Bin's portrayal. Now that I've finished the series I'm gonna make sure to watch EVERYTHING else these actors are in.I give this series an 11 out of 10 stars.

This is my first ever K-Drama and I'll be honest here. I loved it. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and an excellent series. Everything is amazing - Story, Main Leads, Their Chemistry, Acting, Thrill, Action Sequence, Star Cast, Background Score, Music. I completed this series in 3 days and I am suffering from Post Drama Syndrome now. I can't get over it. After completing this series, like everyone else, I am searching everything about CLOY on YouTube, Google.This is such a series which will never leave you. No matter how hard you'll try you can't forget it. You'll fall in love with all the characters, be it Captain Ri Jung Hyuk, Yoon Se ri, Gu Seung joon or Park Kwang beom. They all justified their characters and got immense love from viewers. You'll cry with them, laugh with them and start feeling their pain & emotions.And what to say about Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin chemistry. It's magical. You'll start rooting for them. Hyun Bin was Rustic and Rough in NK but Classic and Dashing in SK. He can be tough and cute at the same time. He totally nailed his role and I read that he learned Piano for this role. Son Ye Jin was a great choice for the role of Yoon Se Ri. She played her role as a helpless SK Woman in NK and a strong, confident businesswoman in SK. I especially loved her character development.I have fallen in love with CLOY. And I am definitely going to watch other K-Dramas now. And this is my first ever review on IMDb. I created my account on IMDb to let South Korean people know that I have fallen in love with your country, your culture, your actors, and film industry. Lots of love from India! This series made me feel like visiting South Korea and having some friends from that land in my life :) Lots of love!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"If you have been frustrated by all the recent K-dramas that have been marketed as ""romance"" films just because they include some romantic content, I am pleased to report that this one is the genuine article. Yes, the plot is peppered with lots of suspense, action & comedy as well, but those elements always remain peripheral to the unfolding love story.Aside from being technically polished, this show also boasts a great (if understated) script and cast who were respectively endearing or despicable (depending on their roles). I also loved the layered backstories, deep friendships and various inter-dynamics among the characters. Plus, despite some bittersweet moments, the unconventional ending was happy and hopeful.And although this IS a romance film, I just have to say: THE COMEDY!!! Unlike many K-dramas which might get a chuckle from me with slapstick moments or exaggerated expressions, the humor in this show comes from hilarious culture-related misunderstandings, misinterpretations, shocks and awkwardness that left me in stitches. I nearly woke my kids up a few times because I couldn't stop laughing! And that gaming scene with the ""Memories of the Alhambra"" Easter egg nearly killed me. :DOf course there were some weak points. In particular, I thought many of the hand-to-hand combat scenes seemed a bit unrealistic and looked too rehearsed. There were also a number of scenes that were overly melodramatic, poorly executed or just outright impossible (the tandem paragliding scene, for example). But considering that this show is obviously meant to be a departure from reality, I can't really count these issues as faults. No film can do everything perfectly, right?In summary, if you like K-drama, are looking for a romance story that will make you laugh out loud, cry a little, and you don't mind having to continually suspend your disbelief, you should give this one a try. Highly recommended!ROMANCE RATING: 8.5/10
I thought Hyun Bin & Son YeJin had believable chemistry and they shared 5+ kiss scenes (very generous by K-drama standards!) The more serious kisses were also quite long, and fell somewhere between PG-13 & NC-17 for passion level. To be totally honest, I felt both Hyun Bin & Son YeJin's performances in this film were a bit too understated for my personal taste, but they still delivered when it came to the romantic parts, so it's all good! :)",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"This series was not really what I had expected. It turned out to be basically a soap opera, albeit partly in an unusual setting. Sixteen 80-90 minute long episodes was way, way too much to tell this story. The subplots, especially the one with Jeong-hyeok's brother, were not very interesting. Combined with too much Korean over-the-top style acting in some parts, it gets a bit dull after a while.The show can be divided into two parts: The first half in North Korea, and the second in South Korea. The show is essentially over once Se Ri is back in South Korea, but at that point we still have 7 episodes, or roughly 10 hours, to go.The first half is without a doubt the best, a solid 9. The second half could easily be summarized in one 90 minute episode, because it's painfully drawn out with plenty of slow motion romantic shots and cheesy Korean ballads blaring repeatedly, with a score of 4-5. In the end, a combined score of 7 is quite generous considering the second half which is quite a slog to get through.The pair in the lead are good. The character which turned out to be the most interesting, Seo Dan, isn't given a whole lot to do.It was interesting to see a portrayal (realistic or not) of daily life in North Korea, in the city as well as the countryside. One thing I liked in particular is that the North Koreans were portrayed as humans, and not mindless automatons.I travelled around in North Korea a few years ago, and some of the exteriors of Pyongyang were spot on (like the view from Kim Il Sung square of the Taedong river with the Juche tower in the background), others were not, especially Pyongyang at night. The fictional international hotel in the show is clearly meant to represent Koryo Hotel (where I stayed), judging from the exterior (although it's missing a skybridge). The interior however looks nothing like the real thing.6-8 episodes which focused on the actual story would have been perfect.",neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"I watched ""Descendants of the Sun"" and wondered if I'd see another series that could match it. Then, I watched ""Mr. Sunshine,"" and thought, ""there's no way I'll ever see another series like this."" Imagine the joy of being wrong twice! Along comes, ""Crash Landing on You,"" which may end up being my favorite of all of them. It's a toss-up between this and Mr. Sunshine. In short, this is one of the best series I've ever seen, and for me, the Korean Dramas I've watched have not disappointed at all as most are character and plot driven. In fact, overall, I've seen better quality shows out of Korea and Japan in the last several years than I have with American shows.The writing, and especially, the editing is some of the best I've ever seen. The plot is intricately weaved, not using some of the typical cliches and devices as some shows do when trying to get the two main characters together. In this case, we're given the beautiful wise lesson on screen: happiness is in the journey. Not the destination.Seri is a woman who owns her own company and is part of an extremely rich family. Her world, despite the money and success, is cold and empty. She sits alone in a massive penthouse. She has all of the luxuries that one could ask for. However, she has a family, especially her half-siblings, who are about as cut-throat as anyone could imagine. She doesn't realize what is missing in her life until a storm, while para-gliding, blows her across the border into North Korea.Ri Jeong-Hyeok is a North Korean captain who comes across Seri. At first, he and his unit of men aren't sure who Seri is and why she's there. Ri Jeong-Hyeok was a master pianist before joining the military, and intent on solving the mystery of his older brother's death. At first, he seems very straight-forward and unassuming, while underneath is a man full of life, passion, and love.The first set of episodes of Seri trying to adapt to life in a North Korean village are especially hilarious. Imagine a pampered woman suddenly having to go without electricity? How to take a bath...how to cook, etc. As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I know full well what this adaptation feels like!Perhaps for the first time in her life, Seri not only finds a connection with Ri Jeong-Hyeok, but also with the village women and also with the members of Ri Jeong-Hyeok's unit. It's ironic that she had to cross the border to find a group of people who were more like family for her than her real family back home!The best plots are ones that aren't forced or contrived, and this one doesn't use either one. We are taken effortlessly from North Korea into South Korea as Seri and Ri Jeong-Hyeok find themselves at the center of two sinister plots, each one contrived by people on either side (North and South Korea).Of course, the biggest question is: despite the situations they must survive and unravel, can they spend a life together? Is it feasible for two people, from the only divided country in the world, be able to have a relationship? North Korea might as well be the darkside of the moon, as communications between the people of the two countries is non-existent. Finding the answer to this question is the beauty of the journey of this series.The entire cast is simply terrific. They meticulously and effortlessly give us endearing characters who are absolutely hilarious at times and heartfelt at others. All are also able to deftly convey a range of emotions, especially the two leads in Hyun Bin and Ye-Jin Soon whose chemistry is much of what makes this series so incredible.The editing is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie or series as we are given scenes in one episode, only to realize that we were only given a partial look at the whole. Each time, we are given a joyful surprise and many, ""Ah-ha"" moments when we realize what really happened!Apparently North Korean defectors served as consultants on this series to try and make life in North Korea depicted as accurately as possible.Some might feel that the ending isn't the most ideal, but that's why I like it. It's realistic. They end up making the absolute most of the time that they have. These contrived, formulaic ""happy endings"" simply do not reflect life or relationships themselves.I have been watching movies and television series for over 45 years, and frankly, this series absolutely blew me away. It captured my imagination and my heart as I see a veritable ""Romeo and Juliet"" struggling to find ways to connect, love, and protect each other. They are such a short distance away from each other across the border, but as I stated before, the distance might as well be from the earth to the moon. I love stories about relationships, where the two people have to find a way to overcome the obstacles and pitfalls laid out before them. Two people with enough love and determination will always find a way. And that is why the joy of watching this series is in the journey and not the destination! And this journey was simply sweet, magical, and joyful. What more could you ask for in a great series?",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

A million times of ""it was my fault"", ""no it was my fault not yours"", ""you're getting hurt because of me"", ""I will protect her with my life"". I got so bored of hearing the same sentences over and over again and the lead guy's countless 'poems'. I enjoyed the 4 friends tho the whole time. It also didn't really have a storyline.

I find the story is so boring that I couldnt finish it and I gave up on 11th episode.Compared to previous Park Ji Eun project (ie. My Love from The Star), the story was too plain. The acting is good, the cast is good, the biggest weakness here is the plot.I dont understand about the hype of its drama, but nothing I can relate towards this drama message to its viewer.

The main actors Hyun Bin and Son Jin are great with their performance and bring the real two characters to life. Cannot think of any two other actors to do these roles.
The story line which takes place in two countries make you feel like there are two dramas within one drama and therefore there is no time to get bored.
All the other supporting characters do a great contribution in bringing the story to life and i believe this is a great masterpiece and i don't have any complains about anything by far.

Now I know I am an old goat of nearly 68, when I layed eyes on Ye-jin Son, the Yoon Se-Ri character, I was smitten. Just a most gorgeous woman in these days pop creations bombarding us from all sides, it takes me to need a foreign movie to capture me and hold my attention for over 4 to 5 hours straight! I told my wife that she needed to watch Crash Landing On You. It is in Korean, but subtitles are well easy to read. This movie offers it all. Greedy siblings, a corrupt N Korean officer and some FANTASTIC scores being played. Well as luck would have it, I told my wife all I required her to watch was the first episode. Today was an off day for her and we took in 6 episodes. I am peppered with questions, and there is a new, rabid fan in our home.

The story is good and you'd be tempted to binge. But what makes this show shine are the great actors - we have laughed so much, cried so much, it is a rare gem.A bit of the acting is too much, as should be expected, and a few characters are quite one-dimensional.

tt10850932,"The story is funny and emotional and sometimes also exciting. I really liked the first few episodes (good humor) and the development of the relationship between the main characters (in the beginning at least). I felt however that the chemistry between the main characters could have been better resp. Was not delivered. I also got bored by them halfway through the drama and was actually rather looking forward to seeing the secondary couple and their evolving relationship. Without the secondary characters (and here I mean the soldats, the women from the village and the other couple), I might not have finished the drama... although the scenery in Switzerland was so nice :) Gotta visit my own country next before going abroad #covid19",neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

One reason this KD does not have a higher rating in SK and US is that it airs on cable channel/pay TV/ Netflix which normally have a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS).",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

I would have liked a little bit more action and happier ending. The idea of them meeting just 2 weeks per yeat in Swiss made me very sad. It also bothered me that the con artist died... Why? He was a very good man in the end. It was the only moment during the movie when i cried. It would have been better to leave him alive.
Besides than this, the differences betwen North and South are so well displayed. It made me search the internet more about North Korea and see if things really are like that. Good job for the story writer.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"One of the most well written and acted Korean dramas I have ever seen! The main couple have SO much chemistry and are such a good match despite their differences. There are multiple story lines and characters but they fit so well together. My favorite characters (besides the main couple) are the soldiers helping Captain Ri and the group of women from the military camp. So funny!The plot includes what life might be like in North Korea and it's fascinating! Power outages, hopping salespeople for when the train breaks down, strict dress/hair code, etc. They come from different worlds and it's interesting to see them each discover the other's world. Absolutely brilliant!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"Ok, so this show is simply amazing. It has the perfect pace in the show. The reason i say this is because many K-Dramas tend to lag during the middle of the season to meet the 16 episodes they want to end at. Now this show literally doesn't lag it really all connects well and is intense and you just want too see the next episode NOW but have to wait a week on netflix for the next two episodes (its so hard to wait!). The two mains are absolutely perfect. The other actors in this show do so well too. You really get involved in the characters because they give a good background even to not main characters they at least give you something about them and you really care about the characters in this show and want too see more! Def a must watch! Do it watch it now!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

Even Captain Ri's father scenes were so funny even they're not trying to.Please continue to produce more!!!,positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"After all the recommendation and the hype, I had to give this a watch. And truth is? The first half was blatantly amazing. It kept you interested and just binging episode after episode. The writing is smart, witty, and creative. The acting is superb.However, in the 2nd half, things pretty much fell apart as if the writers ran out of ideas. The pace slowed down to a drag that often I found myself skipping bits here and there. They also included way too many side stories that it was hard to follow the main plot. The whole thing became convoluted. It was extremely disappointing.Perhaps what was most disappointing was how unrealistic it became that you lose the suspension of disbelief. In the first half, every time they were in trouble or there was a seemingly impossible situation, they came up with creative and unexpected ways to solve it. For example, the boat incident that they resolved in the hilarious kissing scene.However, in the 2nd half, the writing was completely cliche. The protagonist took on dozens of armed bad guys with his bare hands like he's a comic book hero. But the disappoint was the fact he was in a jam and we were expecting a creative twist that never came.The run time also expanded in the 2nd half, running around 1 hr and 20-30 mins, almost 33% more than the 1st half. But that is not because they had more material, just the opposite. They spent so much time on slow motion dramatic shots, crying and talking, etc... It was becoming annoying, hence why I skipped bits and pieces trying to get back to the storyline.Finally, the ending was completely unsatisfying. I have already predicted they would end up back in Switzerland, but the notion that these two will just now forever meet once a year for 2 weeks in Switzerland? That was not a very satisfying ending because there are so many different and better ways that could've gone. I mean, wasn't he studying music in Switzerland in the beginning? That would mean he was staying there at least a semester to several years right? And he didn't finish his study because of his brother's death? So could he not have finished his study? That would at least allow them to stay in Switzerland months to years instead of every 2 weeks.And eventually his parents would be dead, then why not just defect to South Korea? He doesn't need to worry about his father's wealth, the girl is rich, infinitely rich.Anyways, though the major story is new, but many of the story elements are actually taken from other dramas, a lot I recognize from My Girl with Lee Da Hae. For example, the rich and poor contrast, the double lovers, the lying, and even some of the jokes. Compare to My Girl, this series is average at best. My Girl is superior by far with a consistent storyline that carries you from episode 1 to 16 flawlessly.So 6/10 would be generous.",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

This was the second time I cried watching a tv series after the red wedding in GOT. More people need to watch this amazing story.

I didn't know anything about North Korean and doubt it to be real until I watched this, I googled the information about the relationship between NK and SK, I saw how a North Koreans react to this drama. Wow, they actually well researched, the plot was excellent, the cinematography was so amazing, and don't forget the after credit scenes. Thanks to all cast, their chemistry was beyond everything.

I found it so frustrating looking at his same blank dumbfounded look the entire time when there could've been more emotions. The love scenes between these two were not intense enough on screen (it could be because if the blank looks?). The supporting actors played by Kim Jung-hyun (the con man) and Yang Kyung-won (loud soilder) were very well portrayed, captivating, and amusing to watch.
Overall, a good storyline, enough suspense and twists to be engaging, and some heart felt scenes relating to friendship and family love.

If multiple people are trying to kill you, you don't return to your house and chill out for an evening. These plot holes are so so easy to fix. But in the end it was just insufferable.

The whole thing works, the alchemy between the actors, the story line, the unexpected twists, the non standard story telling, the humor , the slow pace focused on the emotional rollercoasters of the different heroes.
The further it goes, the most unbelievable sweet it turns into, that I would normally switch to a different program, but you can't escape it, You get into the Korean story line, the obvious dilemmas in the relationship that 's building up and up.There should not be a second season, the end is what it is, but it will remain one of a kind TV impact for me, as I experienced ""the breakfast club"" a long time ago.

In short, several things stand out:The quality of the plot - very dynamic, with an incredible high pace and really well written. Every episode has so much depth that could really be squeezed in a whole season. The plot also offers a really high range of comedy, drama, action and romantic stories. In most of the cases, the caracters make the most reasonable and logical actions - and this is not always common;The vibe of North Korea - a credible, deep, human and interesting dive in the most unknown culture and society of the world;The quality of the actors - some of them, specially some of the secondary actors really stand out and create an impact with a really low screen time;It was hard for me to explain to others why I was absolutly hooked to a korean drama.

I'll have to admit, this was my first Korean romance series! We needed a break from the tense political news & wanted to watch something we could escape to. After the first episode, I was not sure what to think as it was a bit slow. But after that first episode, things pick up and completely submerse you. It's everything all wrapped up into one: romance, drama, thriller, suspense, comedy. The acting is so amazing!!!! I'm in awe of this wonderful production. I laughed in the beginning & middle, while I cried and gasped in the last half. Watch all the way until the end, you'll love it!

tt10850932,"This is a korean drama that I am glad i saved to watch whilst we are globally in lockdown. I know it will be good as I have seen some post in social media and some online review so I already have some expecations.Usually when you have good expectation you tend to be a bit disappointed when you didnt meet it. But this one did not disappoint one bit.
Characters in this drama are perfectly chosen. HYun Bin is dashing both in his military and civilian clothes. my gosh he is a delight to watch in all angles. His cold reaction is both endearing and manly. Son ye jin is a strong street wise woman that doesnt just cry and get scared in the corner. They have a very good chemistry that you would want to be put to reality. This is not a teen comedy drama nor any other drama that is over the top. This drama is a an adult kind of love that attraction started from the very first episode and Yoon Se ri has said that in a comedic way from the beginning. The risks they take to save each others lives prove the love they have for each other. The thoughtfullness that one has for each other is remarkable. You feel their pain and happiness and the difficulties they face for not being allowed to be together just because they are in a conflicting nation. The amount of times they say their goodbyes are all so painful that you would think it would always be their last time to see each other.
The supporting characters hyun Bin subordinates played their part really well. They show how a north korean would react to the many things that are just ordinary in SK but lacked in NK. The women villagers are overpowering in the beginning but it shows that the people in NK are just normal human being capable of showing emotions doing their day to day lives in a small village. I have done some researched after watching this drama and it says the lifestyle by the north korean depicted in this drama is true to what is happening in there and I would like believe that.
There are no loose end on this drama. Everything is very well explained as to what, how, why something happen. Which is what i love on korean drama. You will not have the urge to throw a glass to the Television screen in frustration which we sometimes feel in some hollywood dramas.
The writer is very clever that no one among the main characters ended with defection from each others country. They subtly choose Switzerland as a neutral country to stay. Brilliant!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

After that, it wasn't until the full series was available and had been for a while that I went back and watched the rest of the show.I really enjoyed the show, whose two main stars I have seen in other shows that I also loved. It was quite slow moving, but had plenty of tension, action and laughs along the way. The way it ended was interesting, as I guess it was quite realistic - but also would you want to live your life like that? Well, I guess it's better than nothing right?Anyway, I'm not sure how much I can take as gospel the information gleaned about life in North Korea from this show, and I'd never presume to believe I'm now an expert - but it was still interesting to get that insight.I loved all the supporting characters as well as the main hero and heroine.

I've been waiting for that dissapointing moment since episode one, and I'm baffled but still waiting. So far this show has literally been perfect, at least for me. The casting and acting have surpassed even my high expectations, the settings have been jaw dropping, the attention to detail when it comes to North Korea, even though it's not, it totally sells it that it is. You can tell the writer really took out all the guns on this one and tried to do her best work, and it shows. True, there's still six episodes so anything could happen, but it's hard to imagine how this show could miss the mark when it has done sooo well so far. Not one episode has disappointed, not one characters, not one scene, not one line delivery. I foresee this show becoming an all time best, and if it doesn't it'll be a crime.

The starred couple is even rarely seen together during the episodes!K-dramas are normally 40-45 mins. long, yet this one lasts for 1.5 hours for some reason. It is not hard to observe that they pushed to make it this long by using uncalled scenes, flashbacks and everything.

-Son Ye Jin comes into North Korea after being sucked into a tornado. It makes zero sense that she survived the tornado while paragliding with no serious injury, and only had some cuts and bruises.
-The attitudes of the North Korean army members are too soft. It is unbelievable that there are so many nice guys.
She had a different accent the whole time and no one found that suspicious. Even if she is a secret agent in SK she would still not forget her North Korean accent.-The selling of SK products at the market seems too easy.

The minute I started watching, though, I couldn't stop and binged on the episodes available till that date (13 episodes then!). The chemistry between the leads is amazing, and their acting beyond fantastic. As for the 'side' characters, for me they were an integral part of the series and not 'side' at all. On the contrary, they gave life to the story, especially the North Korean soldiers (the friends of Jeong-Hyeok), whether with their funny side or humane side. Most important though was the beautiful love story between Se-ri and Jeong-Hyeok, which made the first drastically change in character and the second go the extra mile and do what seems impossible to protect his love... let alone the love gestures he so silently offers to Se-ri (especially those shown in the last few episodes).

This one is also a hit BUT I will say for a drama immersion show, the soundboard effects really killed it for me :( One moment I would be completely immerged in this show, it's got an amazing and convincing cast, a GREAT plot, good character build up but the moment you become completely enthralled, it hits you with cat fight noises in scenes and other such unique soundboard effects that would grip you back to reality ,going 'huh?'. It has the hype & buildup to be a HUGE hit on its own so I'm not sure why the creators decided this would make it better. So far though, this show has the buildup and plot to be as big as hit series The Walking Dead, but those sound effects need to go imo.

I mention this, because it kind of has the feel of some of the good humour from some animes I like.

tt29569035,"I'm searching for a supernatural romance and tbh this is fulfilling for me. I don't care about the plot or how unlogical/logical this show is either. The visuals are mesmerizing and are the ones that attract people to watch and I kinda like some of the romance scenes. But sometimes the long ahh eye contact scenes with dramatic ost doesn't click with me as it kinda feels like it's exaggerated and cringe, but for me it isn't a big problem. This drama is making me excited for the next episodes even though idk what kind of story awaits in the future.Tbh I have no problem with the FL swaying easily as in my opinion it is realistic, as I sway easily either, example when my bias is wrecked by another member of a certain group, or when i had a small crush on a certain someone then changes the next day(well no one knows about me having a very abnormal and crazy mind), I think it's okay as long as we're not overly confident about it. I just hope that the FL doesn't do any more embarrassing thing because of her being swayed easily, because sometimes I kinda see it coming😨 but for know it's not that deep.I'm a fan of cliche stories as I just watched kdramas and I think this show is suitable for the ones who enjoys this kind of story.

Arrogant, superficial, silly, what is there to like I don't know.4. Not funny. I should just avoid Korean rom coms, the humour is very silly and unless that's your thing, just not enjoyable5. Slow.

So, I could guess that they had a sad ending in the previous life but they'll have a happy ending in the new life
2) Even the ending resembled Legend of blue sea. Female lead takes a bullet to save the male lead...meh too cliche
3) Male lead at first perishes but then returns...pretty much predictable. Just like goblin returns after perishing
4) Being reincarnated as a demon because he did many bad things in his life...this concept is the same as the grim reaper in 'The Guardian: lonely & great god'

A visually explosive scene between a confused Demon (Song Kang) and the mysterious snaggle-toothed baglady blew me away. There is a big dose of cosmic philosophy entering the picture and it quite unnerved me. This is no ordinary Korean rom-com, that's for sure. I stayed for all the lingering doe-eyed ""will they or won't they"" gazes, the rockstar Demon's high stylin' wardrobe, the gleaming CGI frozen-in-time moments, and the unmasking of a human monster obssessed with a schmaltzy-eerie k-pop lovesong.

tt29569035,"...but at least the Titanic had a band.MY DEMON is a series with no organizing theme. Is it about the migrating tattoo? A would-be killer on the loose? A dysfunctional family drama? What we get is a number of false starts that lead nowhere. It feels like too many writers were pulling this mess in different directions.Hey, everybody--your homework is to read the green DEMON'S MANUAL. The rules keep changing, but it's got to be in there. Here's the question: Can demons be shot and killed--or not?The attraction between the two leads is all about physical appearance. These generic lovers do generic things: he brings her flowers, they watch a horror movie, they ride a bike, she cooks, etc. Etc. I couldn't find any convincing individuality-or chemistry. In fact, it sure looked like Song Kang used his hand to block their first kiss.And Do-Hee isn't the brightest cookie in the jar. It takes until Episode 14 for her to show the slightest curiosity about her husband's day job. She's horrified, of course, but she sure gets over it quickly. ""Oh, you take the souls of desperate people who are then tortured forever? And one of them's my dad? No problemo.""And I'm sorry--because I really like him-Song Kang is totally miscast as a demon. For most of the series he's sweet and loving or having a fashion moment. He's just not the baddy the audience deserves. I blame the writers because Song Kang can ACT when he's got a good script (see Navillera).The secondary characters engage in a lot of silliness that never adds up to a single genuinely funny moment. As for God, s/he just bloviates about all the things she can't do. No help there, though I have a feeling she'll come through in the end.Later: I finished the series, and while a lot of the silly stuff was wrapped up, I can't see that anything important was resolved. A minor character is going to be damned for all eternity--someone who absolutely didn't deserve it. But no one in this series has a moral compass, so no one cares--as long as the big romance is saved. A lot of filler in the last two episodes. I was so ready for this one to end.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The narrative delves into this theme with a nuanced understanding, using its characters and their interactions to reflect on the corrupting influence of greed and power in society.The chemistry between the human and demon characters is the heartbeat of the series. Their love story is portrayed with such authenticity and depth that it transcends the fantastical elements of the plot. Their journey, filled with obstacles and societal prejudices, is a testament to the enduring power of love and acceptance.Moreover, 'My Demon' is a masterclass in storytelling, with its plethora of twists and turns that keep viewers guessing.

tt29569035,"Embark on a whirlwind adventure with My Demon, the latest sensation to sweep the K-drama scene. Picture this: a contract marriage with an immortal demon, a sizzling tango in the streets, and our leads beating up goons with their combined special powers. Intrigued? You should be. This series is as fun as K-dramas get, offering a thrilling ride filled with chemistry, amusing banter, and well-timed humor.Meet Do Do Hee, the CEO of Mirae F&B, a subsidiary of the formidable Mirae Group led by her strong adoptive mother, Ju Cheon Sook. When a disastrous matchmaking attempt leads her to a blind date with the 200-year-old Demon Jeong Gu Won, little does she know that her life is about to take a wild turn. A series of events binds them together, with Gu Won's tattoo - the source of his power - transferred to Do Hee.As Do Hee and Gu Won navigate their newfound connection, tragedy strikes with the sudden death of Cheon Sook, leaving Do Hee to inherit the Mirae Empire under one condition: she must marry within a year. Thus begins a violent power struggle between Do Hee and her adopted siblings, who stop at nothing to prevent Mirae from slipping into her hands.Determined to uncover the truth behind Cheon Sook's death and tired of being underestimated her whole life, Do Hee proposes a marriage of convenience to Gu Won. She'll inherit Mirae and gain a powerful bodyguard, while he'll retain access to his supernatural abilities.But My Demon isn't your typical gloomy supernatural drama. Song Kang brings a refreshing twist to Gu Won, infusing the character with humor and mischief. Far from the brooding archetype, Gu Won is chaotic yet endearing, with a youthful energy that complements his demon status. Meanwhile, Kim Yoo Jung shines as Do Do Hee, exuding steely grace and intelligence as she navigates the complexities of her new role and relationship.The chemistry between Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung is undeniable, igniting the screen with every interaction. Their dynamic portrayal of two seemingly different individuals who find common ground is electrifying and utterly captivating.Not to be overlooked is Kim Hae Sook's portrayal of Ju Cheon Sook, whose character transcends stereotypes with her shrewdness and empathy, adding depth to the narrative.While My Demon keeps viewers guessing with its intriguing plot twists and power struggles, it's not without its flaws. Secondary characters may feel one-dimensional at times, but they serve to enhance the central storyline.In essence, My Demon may not be a profound love story like Hotel Del Luna or Goblin, but it doesn't aim to be. It's a modern, light-hearted take on supernatural romance that delivers entertainment, engagement, and impeccable execution.

South Korea must lead the world in both (loving) parents dying in a tragic accident while their children are still young.2. Chaebol adopts, orphan, which evidently happens to orphans in Korea almost as often as parents get killed in a car crash.3. Chaebol family is horrible.4. There's a demon. Happens all the time. The demon usually either has a boss who tells him/her the rules of being a demon, or in this case, has an instruction manual.5. There's a psycho killer. Because every romantic comedy needs a psycho killer. But the psycho killer only makes random appearances as necessary to create opportunities for the male lead to rescue the female lead.6. Orphan becomes the only nice person in the chaebol family and is incredibly successful.7. executives in the orphan's company are a bunch of silly idiots. Because evidently it's very common to have a brilliant CEO supported by dimwits who are department managers or vice presidents. As successful as she is, I guess she wasn't able to hire all the brilliant graduates of Seoul National University.8. Demon has silly sidekicks too.9. The demon i.e. Male lead is a jerk at first but who wants to bet that he's going to learn something from the human and what do you think is gonna happen in the end?We all know where this is going we all know where this has been. I assume that Kim yoo-jung will be able to star in K dramas for another 20 years. She deserves better than this.The ratings in Korea have been low.

tt29569035,"Ok , so here are the views on my demon.When i was searching on youtube i wrote 'my' and in suggestion i got 'my demon' . I got interested and clicked on suggestion. And then on netflix i saw it.It wasnt bad. I watched episode 6 first and got curious . Then when i saw from the start , i loved the story.Beauty catches the eyes but Character catches the heart.This drama has both. Whole drama gives visual relief.The Characters of main cast in the drama are very nice.The main cast(4 in total as I saw on wikipedia) of My demon do natural acting like if each is really into the soul of each character of drama.Speciality is that the show keeps big truths towards viewers.Many things are kept in suspense.Things like devil's heart change towards human emotions , greed of humans in their tough times , devil's past when he was a human , his transformation into devil ,etc. Are kept here ,some are in suspense.Such things need big truths to be shown as a solution. If the drama gives those to the viewers, it will become a masterpiece because it will present the truth .Truth makes you stronger. This drama can become stronger than any other drama.All is well if end is well.I gave 5 stars because only half story is before us.The best is yet to come.All the best.THE ADVICE TO THE VIEWER IS THAT ENJOY THE DRAMA AND TRY TO FIND THOSE DEEP TRUTHS HIGHLIGHTED IN ITS STORY .",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt29569035,"This kdrama is amazing. It has literally everything fantasy, comedy, romance, suspense, mystery and even more. The plot is also very good too, i highly recommend this kdrama!! The actors are very good and it has an interesting story n stuff. Every episode had something shocking and none of them were boring which i really liked. The chemistry between kim yoo jung and song kang is so undeniable too!! This kdrama is like an enemies to lovers thing i love it sm. The OST is also very nice and good in my opinion, also the KISS SCENESSS THEY DIDNT COME HERE TO PLAY WITH THE KISS SCENES OMLLL no one is talking ab the kiss scenes bro like in most kdramas their lips barely even touch but THIS kdrama had amazing kiss scenes.

Wtf.What are these entertainment industries trying to implement to the general population? That demons are good??? And the fact that so many people are hyped up about it is just sad. Religion aside it's plain boring and cliche. The leads are hard to look at in terms of acting skills and frankly not suited for the parts Especially with chemistry.Nonetheless the plot is silly and it's a complete waste of time.

tt29569035,"7/10 is my rating. This is a 2023/2024 South Korean supernatural romance drama with 16, 67 (average) minute episodes.First I provide a unique synopsis then reviewSynopsisDo Do Hee (Kim You Jung) is the adopted daughter and heir apparent to a conglomerate company called the ""Future Group"". She is known as a devilish, hard hitting, and ""take no prisoners"" executive who has won many awards. Her adopted mother, Joo Chun Sook (Kim Hae Sook) made it clear, when she was alive, that Do Hee would take over after she passed. This does not endear Do Hee to Chun Sook's children who consider it their right to inherit all of their mother's assets. The obvious solution to some of them is to get rid of the problem. In this case the problem is Do Hee. When a serial killer is hired to kill Do Hee, he nearly succeeds until Jung Koo Won (Song Kang) appears in his role as a Demon who strikes deals with mortals by granting wishings in return for their trip to Hell 10 years later. He originally plans to only save Do Hee if she enters into an agreement but then agrees to save her and then talk about the agreement. In the chaos that follows they both wind up nearly drowning and the tattoo that gives Koo Won his supernatural powers, transfers to Do Hee. Koo Won finds that he can still perform his role and have access to his power by holding Do Hee's wrist where the tattoo is located. When Jun Sook tragically dies a condition of inheriting the business is Do Hee must marry within a year. Koo Won agrees to a contract marriage for mutual benefit, he needs to be close to her to touch her tattoo and she needs a husband to secure her inheritance. The two have twisted fate in the present, but things get even more fate based when it appears they also had a connection in the past.ReviewWhen I looked at reviews there seemed to be those that really loved this series but there was a near equal number that did not like it well. I am in the ""did not like it well"" camp. I think it is worth watching for the two talented actors, great chemistry and interesting premise if you can relax your expectations for a sensible plot. I was actually bored at times because the progress would hit a stall. I would recommend drama fans watch it once but I wouldn't rush out to watch it.SpoilersI have seen hundreds of dramas at this point and that could be why I am among those that found this one very underwhelming. The main couple got together too early in my opinion. Then was no sense of anticipation. It did not make sense to me that she was so driven and determined to be the heir and then she just gave it up. I know they were trying for the ""anything for love"" angle, that she was willing to give up all the power and money to protect herself and the person she loved but it was out of character in my opinion.The serial killer bad guy who was hunting her died too early. I was wondering what they were going to have happen next. It was just odd to have that particular bad guy gone so early in the story.Two very annoying things in this one. Usually you feel somewhat sorry for 2nd girl or guy and I did like second guy but the 2nd girl was one of the most annoying I have experienced to date. They tried hard to gain our sympathy for her in showing how he saved her from abuse but, even that, did not excuse her toxic behavior later. She even tried to get main girl to drink poison so that the main guy, who is a demon who already lived hundreds of years, could live. Although she had hung around him for over a decade and he showed no interest she still blamed main girl for wrecking her chance. What chance? Her jealousy was misplaced and annoying.The other annoying thing was the romance between the elder couple. It was fine they liked each other, even cute, but them hiding it for so long became ridiculous. I think it was supposed to be funny and they definitely did the big reveal where they thought they were hiding it but everyone already knew. Oh ha ha! Like we have never seen that play out before. It was unoriginal and just not funny.When Netflix gets ahold of something I know it is going to be drawn out too much and there will be way too many flashbacks. That was the case in this one. The plot would already be dragging because so many of the major conflicts and reveals already happened and then, oh great, let's rehash the whole script again.They, of course, had to do the separating from you for your own good trope. I don't like that trope. It is right up there with the amnesia trope for me.I believe it was confirmed the leads were dating in real life and they definitely had that level of chemistry. It is not their fault the script was just awful at some points. Their acting was excellent but the content was off.There was so much potential in this one. With a great cast and interesting premise this could have been a great addition to the supernatural genre. I am not sure how they managed to make it so drawn out and boring except the pacing and when they chose to do reveals.#MyDemon#SongKang#KimYouJung#KimHaeSook.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The family drama is quite enjoyable as well, with many melodramatic moments. The crime case as well has some intense moments.The love story, on the other hand, is basic and predictable.

tt29569035,"I couldn't find any good drama this year after Dr. Romantic 3 and The Good Bad Mother. I have had a hard time watching kdramas lately because most of them are too plain and boring. And, oh, there's The Glory this year, which was a hit but I haven't seen yet. It's not that it ain't good; it's just that I'm not into bullying-type drama or steamy scenes. Thankfully, I found My Demon on Netflix before the end of the year, and it got me hooked up and well-seated for the entire episode. It has all types of drama in one, which is very rare. It's amazing how every episode has something to it, like a mystery that I wanted to unlock. It's not your typical rom-com, nor would it just fall into the thriller or fantasy category, but it will serve you everything you look for in a drama. It's very interesting and entertaining. I laughed the whole time watching it; I was amazed by the beauty of the cinematography; I got mesmerized by the actors chemistry; I fell in love with their past; I got thrilled with some of the episodes and also made me cry a river. This will go down in history as one of my favorites.

tt29569035,"I was hooked on this drama in the first half of the series; it was lighthearted, funny, beautiful actors, and some interesting fantasy/mythology/supernatural elements. The visuals are breathtaking in some scenes and though it's tropey, if you enjoy that kind of thing it's compelling and entertaining. The pacing in the first half moves quickly, with the characters are introduced well, a couple of different plotlines and personal stakes established, an engaging romance, and it felt well balanced and bingeable.Unfortunately the good parts started to slowly fall away in the second half of the drama, when the character development took a back seat to more murder mystery / crime solving exposition. It just felt like the focus shifted too much and it became a bit boring and hard to finish. It was still worth a watch even if it was underwhelming at the end, because I did enjoy myself for most of it.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt29569035,"If this was a Hollywood drama everyone would say it's hot garbage, the only reason it gets a pass is because it's Korean.I watched it with my girlfriend, for her, because I know she loves these things, but man, every single episode I found myself questioning my very existence and counting the seconds until it ended, 1 hour felt like an entire evening. We still have 3 episodes to go and I don't know how I am going to make it.The intro song is super catchy and that's why I gave this a 4 instead of a 1/10. I love the beginning of each episode and everytime it ends and I know I have an hour to go, I cry inside.This series does not know what it wants to be, a love story, a depressing tale about death and suicide, a fantasy, an action movie, a thriller, and everything in between. The series tries everything and does nothing right. There are so many plot holes and so many convenient/unrealistic things that happen for the sake of moving on with the plot. It's dragged on, and on, and on, without anything interesting happening.I have no idea who the audience for this literal garbage is but if it works it works.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

A wonderful Kim Yoo Jung, who, although young, has acting in her blood since she was a child actor, does everything she can in the conditions of a story full of holes and unsuccessful advertising. Even for the fantasy genre, the script and direction are too bad. Guiding the supporting actors to exaggerate is a big directing mistake, given that it's about people in costume, not peasants. The story is far too long, sickly obsessed with Christmas, Christmas on repeat, Christmas leftovers, torture and food. Average special effects, which would have been successful, if there were not so many statics and replays. Material of 8 episodes, extended to 16 episodes.

It's a feel good fun and enjoyable drama, even the hard to watch scenes are still okay to watch. Because My Demon was a Perfect Demon until his powers were transferred to the FL. But what made it so fun too was after he lost his powers and the scenes where he attempt to do something but he kept saving her during the time his powers were transferred to FL. He would show up every time to save her. And that is how they really fell in love. I have watched 10 episodes as they aired and it has been fun fun all the way through, ofcourse there are serious times and issues to deal with but you will laugh more and cry less. One of my favorite scenes is when the ML intro in the series his visuals was no joke. His hair had a wet look and the front just dangled down on his forehead. That was very pretty so props to the hair & makeup team.A Little Spoiler Alert! Some of My Fav lines I will never forget:
The entire series has some amazing lines that you will never forget like ""Because you are the reason of my symptoms"", ""I am my Bodyguard's Bodyguard"", "" Guwon, my salvation"". "" You will be a perfect Demon"". And lots more!Don't pay attention to the poor ratings. That is what they do to bring down a greatly made series.

I get that you have to stretch it our and make a long series but this is just lazy, boring, and annoying writing. Here's a tip. You could've added more demons in the show if that's what the protagonist is. You could've given him rivals, Achilles heels, etc. Eye candy aside which is obviously the entire objective of the show, you need substance which this show lacks. The female lead is no doubt awesome and fun to watch but everything else is dull. Why the close-ups? Why take so long showing them?

tt29569035,"Hi, so I'm creating and IMDb account just to say thank you to the team behind this show. This was one of the best shows I have watched in years. I think the writing was terrific. Every detail was thought of. There was not a dry moment. I thought the tango scene so good, I had to watch it 20 times. I loved the ending scene, the highs and the lows, the outfits of the female lead which were not overly cute but more boss workspace oriented. I think this would go down as one of the best kdramas if not one of the best TV series of all time. I am not a movie critic. I am just a casual user so I don't agree with other reviews that claim the plot's not well thought of or pacing was too slow. I think the writer is brilliant and I will watch all future shows of the writer but it also helps that the cast looks pretty. Actors were quite seasoned. I didn't like the previous roles the ML picked up haha so I dreaded watching this one until I did, and then I was hooked because of the acting, direction, and story. Thank you for giving me a good time! I can see you cared about the craft and it's taken years to perfect the skillset.

tt29569035,"Entertaining and involving. The demon & his love do such a great job. And none of this would work without them because it sits right on the edge of schmaltz, and the two of them manage to keep it from suicide.The world portrayed has mix of Catholicism, magical powers, reincarnation, and plot twists. I was left feeling the role of Catholicism was being held back against a strong urge to make more of it. Thank goodness for some restraint.It was a fun departure to have ""God"" played by a bag lady, who carefully explains on several occasions that she can guide events and intervene sometimes, but there is a randomness in the evolution of fate, much of it due to the unpredictable behavior of humans, randomness that can surprise her and make her aware of her own limitations.There are many attempts to lighten things up with comedic interjections, mostly way overboard. But one can take them as short digressions from the story's main thrust, which is how the two lovers manage despite adversities and villains of many kinds. And these two actors manage to contain what easily could become a viewer's impatience with long drawn out staring into each others eyes and extended exuberant celebrations of each others company.Altogether a delightful concoction admirable for how well it travels a knife's edge of overdoing things time after time. The viewer enjoys and marvels over its balance.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

1) I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Poor choice of the leads. It's just the visuals of the leads that's getting all the hype. Song Kang isn't giving off the 'demon' aura. Would've been better if they went with a more menacing looking male lead.2) The female lead is weak. Easily swayed.3) The acting isn't delivering what it's supposed to. I'm not getting the emotions.4) Cliché 'damsel in distress' storyline.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt29569035,"I've been watching korean dramas since I was 14 years old (I'm almost 30 now) and fantasy was always my favorite genre but something always felt off in every drama I watched. Either the story was divided with something I didn't care, the ending was sad/lacking which spoiled the drama for me or some other factors that would make me not give it 10/10. But my demon gave me all the fixes I wanted in a great story. Some people complained that some tropes that are in this show are overused or copied but I strongly disagree. In my over 150 dramas that I have seen there is ALWAYS something formulaic, it's the structure of kdramas. What sets one or other apart is how they handle it and some do it better than others. Imo my demon is like that to me. And to top it off it does it with oneof the greatest visuals I have ever seen that ALSO has one of the best chemistry. Every week we fell more in love with Gu Won and Do Hee then in the next one we got behind the scenes content from Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung that made us fall even deeper in love. No wonder it was such a sucess on netflix and social media platforms like twitter and tik tok. Though I assume that what becomes always gets more good and bad attencion so some small group of loud people would always jump on a bandwagon to hate. Happens every time. But overall the sucess is so deserved and made me become a fan of Kim Yoo Jung (who I was already familiar with but still not a fan before) and Song Kang (which was an actor I avoided in romances because of his past characters being either done dirty like love alarm or problematically romanticized red flags like nevertheless). I hope those two will work together in the future because the chemistry was so good and effortless and hope Song Kang will go through enlistment smoothly and come back as great as he is to a sucessful career. Also great sucess in Yoo Jung's next endeavour. They both deserve it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Additional awards overall were won and nominations as well. All of this for 2023 and the series wasn't even over yet as the final wasn't even aired until January 20th. This would be my only criticism of the drama as it is also the best Christmas story ever that I have seen and some of the best Christmas scenes were shown after Christmas. I did not deduct any stars for this as I am not sure who is responsible for the timing of the release of the drama or if or why there were delays, but definitely better to end it in 2023 for both the theme and for better opportunities of awards although it didn't affect SBC. Absolutely great special effects, I can see how much work that department must have put into the fantasy part of the drama, great costuming, and make-up of the supporting character - they made him look so evil.

From the first episode, I realized it was entirely different, funny, exciting, and engaging. The lead actors are beautiful but also excellent actors, especially Kim Yoo-Jung. Song Kang was a little stiff initially, but he significantly improved throughout the episodes. I liked the romance that transcends times, age, social class, and education. I liked that he loved her for over 200 years, and she was always there in his heart. He even forgot her face and name because he couldn't stand the pain of losing her tragically when he was human.

Yes it's a kind of deja vue, but I can say this one had all kinds of styles it had mystery, fantasy, romance but also comedy which I found myself giggling and laughing like a school girl. I loved how depending on a life situation you and anyone would make a deal with a demon if it could turn your life around for the better !. Yes it's all cliche, but I think you will find that in everything from tv series to movies now a days the ideas are often recycled and cliche it's just how the actors deliver it that makes a difference and here they deliver well.

Beautiful because it shows they love each other but tragic because of how many times they almost get killed because of each other.

Character wise, there are other more appealing characters in other Kdramas. I'm definitely more drawn to ""family"" orientated series. The side characters are kind of there for comic relief and that's that. Most kdrama I've watched, they have side characters who have deep connections with the main leads, either family, or chosen family/close friends. I am sorry to say, the female lead is kind of boring for me. I like female characters who have more personality (chaotic, funny).

In the bustling world of K-Dramas, ""My Demon"" emerges as a nocturnal treasure, a series so enthralling that it justifies the under-eye circles from countless nights of binge-watching. The show's mastery lies not just in its captivating storyline but in the layered depth of its characters, each with a narrative rich enough to be a standalone tale.From the opening credits to the last haunting echo of its soundtrack, ""My Demon"" wraps viewers in a visual tapestry that stirs the soul. The cinematography is nothing short of a moving painting, with every frame meticulously crafted. The astonishing pictures it paints are vivid and vibrant, contrasting the dark thematic elements of the supernatural with the all-too-human struggles of its characters.The plot weaves through the lives of individuals who find their destinies intertwined with a sinister force that is both a part of them and an external threat. Each episode peels back layers, revealing the complexities of human emotions and the shadows they can cast. The demon, a metaphor for the inner turmoil and the darkness within, challenges the protagonists, pushing them towards growth and self-discovery.What sets ""My Demon"" apart is its ability to balance the supernatural with the relatable. The writers have skillfully curated each character's journey, ensuring that viewers find a piece of themselves in the heartaches, triumphs, and resolutions on screen. The actors deliver these multifaceted roles with a raw intensity that transcends language barriers, drawing audiences into a shared experience of empathy and engagement.""My Demon"" is a K-Drama that transcends its genre, offering a narrative so riveting that surrendering sleep seems a small price to pay.

Theirs were top-tier and there is really no doubt that they are Do Hee and Guwon, or Wolshim and Yisun. I've never seen a tandem that is so perfectly matched.

tt29569035,"At first, I was so excited for this drama. The visuals are amazing. They paired two of the most amazing actors. I mean, helllooo, son of netflix. So I was hyped about watching it. The first 3 episodes didn't disappoint, but then, this drama started taking a turn I didn't like. It got slow, too slow. There were points were I was like they should have added more conflict, more essence behind the very cringe and corny plot. 16 episodes and by episode 9, we've discovered the real villain?Instead of focusing on making a great plot with amazing twists like good kdramas actually do, they focused so much on creating humour, turning it into an exaggerated rom-com. It was highly over done and most of the comic relief, easily became boring and unnecessary. Characters started losing their voice and balance because they are trying so hard to achieve comic relief.Now that they've focused only on humour, we have only the cliches to hold the plot. Evil Chaebol family. Dead parents, orphaned girl. Demon ML that becomes her saviour. Psychopath serial killer that has it out for the FL (I swear I'm freaking tired of seeing this particular one).The only unique plot in this movie was the whole ""Arranged Marriage"" idea, which they also pulled off very terribly. The romance feels like child's play, when I believe they should have given us a King The Land standard of romance because of the choice of plot. *shake head* so many, many disappointing things about this drama. So many.And thennn, episode 8 & 9 came with the kiss scene that didn't sit right with me. The flow was terribly off. But I struggled to keep following the movie, thinking it would get better.I was also very curious about what other twist would happen in the movie that would drive the story until episode 16 because everything has already happened and concluded. By right, episode 10 should have been the finale of this drama.Now, there was that big pause before episode 11 was released(a.k.a part 2 of the drama), and I'm telling you, this drama is terrible. Episode 11 was nonsense, a complete waste of time. At a point, I was like what the hell am I watching. Y'all should get serious for once. The scene about Gu won getting back his cross tattoo just didn't, and I absolutely mean it, didn't make sense.They shouldn't have produced this.

I mention this, because it kind of has the feel of some of the good humour from some animes I like.

Another factor is that the drama incorporates multiple genres, even though it is labelled 'Romantic TV Comedies', the series showcases much more than that. From drama to comedy, suspense to romance, historical to fantasy - the series is all that you need to brighten up your day. What's even better is that they also include multiple tropes such as enemies to lovers, bodyguard to lovers, past life lovers, fake relationship, forced proximity, marriage of convenience, amnesia, and workplace romance. Not to forget that the visuals were top tier and on par with the well thought out plot. To think that the crew were able to pull off such a difficult concept is impressive and so worth noting.

I was intrigued to tune into this series. He is one of my favorite actors from South Korea. Yet Jeong Gu-won is a very handsome and cunning character that is anchored by a wooden performance from it's leading man. This was one of his weakest on-screen portrayals and the lack of chemistry with Kim Yoo-jung did not support an otherwise well-crafted storyline. I felt Kim Yoo-jung resonated more with Kim Hae-sook in their mother and daughter relationship. I would have loved to see more screen-time between them because
their charisma was radiating.What truly reeled me in this series was the fascinating lore behind demonology. Human beings have formed blood pacts with demons over the centuries to accumulate worldly gain and demons have originally lived amongst human beings to protect them as their guardians. With viewers witnessing Jeong Gu-won accomplish his full purpose as a protector once he and Do Do-hee grow to love one another. My Demon is a slow burner that becomes fulfilling for those who are patient. The narrative may be formulaic and the overindulgent product placement is laughable. But there is much to appreciate such as the gorgeous imagery from the director of photography, the passionate scriptwriting from Cho Ah-Il who serves delicious character-development and the series concluding in a satisfying manner that is quite endearing for the audience.IG: thecinephilereviews.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt29569035,"The drama is just plain bad and boring, which makes me wonder what's the hype all about.1. Unpopular opinion: Visuals are actually bad, styling sucksStarting with the visuals, because apparently it's the visuals of the main leads that's got everyone going crazy, but I believe somehow the makers have made Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung look bad. Both the actors are very good looking, but in the series, their styling actually makes them look not good at all. I especially hated Song Kang's hair, they ruined it and it doesn't suit him. His costumes aren't great either, it's manageable to look at. They did Kim Yoo Jung dirty with the wardrobe, it doesn't suit her whatsoever. Overall, the wardrobe and styling seems to have tried so hard to achieve perfection that it fell flat and came out looking pretentious.2. StorylineI couldn't get through the whole drama, and watched only 8 episodes, that too with fast forwarding. It's very badly written, there are glaring plot holes and the story seems all over the place. It seems pretty much very cliched with the whole damsel in distress narrative for the female lead who's supposed to be a very strong individual. There are no stand out dialogues, or compelling narratives, which would hold viewers emotions or their attention. Our boy Song Kang is supposed to be a demon, a bad boy, he doesn't give the vibe whatsoever. Kim Yoo Jung looks awkward in the role of an adult and it isn't convincing.3. Bad actingDon't know if the bad acting by the two very promising leads is due to a bad script or just that they didn't put in any effort. But the acting is emotionless, expressionless. It's not sad where it is supposed to be, it is not affectionate or romantic either. I don't see why people are saying the leads have good chemistry, I really couldn't see anything there. I guess they are just staring into each other's eyes for very very uncomfortably long to make up for chemistry. The comedic acting is good though, the only bearable few minutes here and there during the whole series.I will end my rant now.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

This means he has to remain close to her to use his powers which is just as well as the children of the Chaebol family are jealous of the relationship with their mother and wish her harm. It is an interesting plot with great side characters, a believable romance and well acted by the entire cast.

tt29569035,"I give the 8 rating because of the overall quality of this series are superb. The visual effects are stunning; the design is very cool and stylish; some of the music used in the background is beautiful, the chemistry between the two is flawless. The rest of the cast also did great job. Some dialogues and funny moments can really make you laugh and there were some swoon romantic scenes for those who crave for it. However, I still have to say that the movie gives out wrong concepts and misunderstanding of Christianity. That's not good at all.Therefore, I must separate between talking about the movie quality itself and that problem of hidden message. I enjoyed watching the film as an entertainment, one fantastic Korean series, no doubt why it is so popular. It is a well-done work with many elements fall into places just perfectly right.Nevertheless, I don't think it's right to make the audience see that the demons are those who work for God, because in reality they aren't. They are always against God. It's quite dangerous to view lightly the concept of making a pact with a demon because that is the very worst thing a person can do to himself or herself. And to create such a good-looking and charming demon who is always a hero to our female main character might make some people who don't know the truth of what demons are become interested and want to get to know one. And lastly, God was shown without much respect in this film. God seems to be one who doesn't really care, like to make bets with people and like to gamble, and always blame most bad things on Earth to human. I just don't think that a true Christian would be happy if they watch it to that part.But I'm not saying that the film is a downright blasphemy. It has its own idea about things, but it's just not nice to play with a concept of one's religion this way.One of the main reason I decided to watch this series is that Song Kang is my most favorite Korean actor.

Do do-hee and Jung gun-won is one of the best visual I have seen.

And I gave the 10 star because the demon destroyed but he came for dodo hae.This drama is fast paced, sometimes too much, tries to do too much, and dives too fast in the characters before we have the chance to actually connect with the characters. Theres a lot of clichés/cheese too...

One of plots is virtually identical to Destined To You. I was expecting a more original twist there.I measure the quality of a series partly by my urge of fast forwarding the slow and insignificant parts. There was quite a bit of that here (maybe 20 to 25%), but nothing outrageous like in Meteor Garden to just name one.Overall, I'd recommend to watch it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Comparing it to other coreean rom-coms it's the most cringe and unfunny I've had watched. The caracther development it's absent, the acting it's pretty basic, nothing happens in a lot of episodes.

This is truly hurting the global K-drama audience as most of us watch K-Drama for the unique plots and storyline.My Demon obviously has outstanding visuals like Song Kang & Kim Yo Jung but their acting is not going to save the sunken ship this time. Villians in this series operate like AI bots, you already know who and their next move.

Beside the fact the do a lot of publicity scenes that it's take a lot from the drama seriousness. And as Muslim I don't appreciate the way they disdain God. This is an insult to all religions.

tt29569035,"I decided to discontinue my viewership of this series upon reaching the ninth episode, primarily due to the lack of a coherent storyline. It became apparent that the creators were banking on the visual appeal of the actors to captivate the audience, but even with a notably handsome actor, the series failed to overcome its inherent dullness. This sense of dissatisfaction resonates similarly with ""King The Land,"" as its narrative failed to captivate me despite the flawless performances delivered by the cast.As I reflect on my viewing experience, the absence of a compelling storyline in the series became increasingly evident, ultimately contributing to my decision to stop watching. The progression of the narrative up to the ninth episode left me perplexed, struggling to discern a coherent direction or purpose. The reliance on the actors' physical attributes to sustain viewer interest was a noticeable but unsuccessful strategy, as the core essence of a gripping plot was missing.Even the presence of a handsome actor, typically considered an asset for viewer engagement, failed to salvage the overall appeal of the series. The shallow reliance on aesthetics, without a substantive and engaging narrative, left the storytelling hollow and unfulfilling. It became apparent that the creators were prioritizing surface-level elements over the crucial foundation of a well-crafted and intriguing plot.While acknowledging the allure of a handsome actor in the series, it underscores the need for a comprehensive and engaging narrative to truly captivate the audience. The mere presence of aesthetically pleasing actors cannot replace the essence of a well-developed and thought-provoking plot. The realization that ""King The Land"" shared this same narrative shortcoming only heightened my disappointment, as it echoed the missed opportunity for two otherwise promising series to leave a lasting impact.In conclusion, my decision to discontinue the series at episode 9 was driven by a profound dissatisfaction with the absence of a compelling storyline. The reliance on actors' appearances as a substitute for a well-crafted narrative proved to be a flawed strategy. This sentiment, echoed in my experience with ""King The Land,"" highlights the importance of prioritizing storytelling depth over superficial elements to create truly captivating and memorable viewing experiences.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Main story line is interesting but they focused on side stories more and that make main story uninteresting. This series maybe made for promotion of products because in every five minutes they show some new products and whenever they don't show new products they promote religion.

Love Claudia Kim's struggles with weight and how her story was resolved. The young girl's story and mind reading is watchable too. Standout young actor and actress. The relationship of the old couple is like some married couples I know.The series however was weakest with the main couple. His time travel got out of hand and impossible to resolve. So in the end the writer gave us a happy ending in that the kid brought him back but couldn't explain why he couldn't come back himself and where he was for so long. Writers in some shows including this one get themselves into a corner with their obstacles and cannot write a proper conclusion so that was ultimately unsatisfying.Chun Woo Hee is pretty from some angles and her hard edge helps her character with the scam artist part at first but hurts the romance part. Didn't feel the love.

tt32166552,"This series has a sophisticated, atmospheric magic blended with real life traumas and believable characters. People in the drama are flawed, but relatable and likeable.In ""The Atypical Family"" story as well as character development expands with an atmosphere - the colour tones, the music scores as well as sound design, and the easily flowing caesural pauses allowing the viewers to take in the vastness of the scene settings, the seriousness of the situations. One could almost compare this drama to a poetry. Actors and their characters are allowed pauses to think, not to say that they're slow, on the contrary, it makes them and their choices more believable.The script and most chosen actors are spectacular in their roles. The characters are written as smart, thinking, conniving ones, not by making others extremely dull and stupid, but by letting them make smart decisions, allowing them to have multiple purposes. Not a single person here is B&W, they all have their own personal colour pallets.For now (6th episode) I could name only one major drawback - the ML's sister. Her character is overweight, but acted by a slim actress, which makes her movements and mannerisms not genuine and weird.All in all I find the story refreshing and interesting, the clashing of one dysfunctional family with a fake united one, the deadpan comedy, the pain of trauma and not managing to let go of the past.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The other ""family"" is a gang of scam artists led by Baek Il-Hong, enforcer Noh Hyeong-Tae, assistant Grace Kang, and our heroine Do Da-hae. The mainspring of the tale is the relation between Gwi-ju and Da-hae. At first they are distant but ultimately in love.The Bok family has superpowers. Mother Man-Heum has dreams that reveal aspects of the future, which made the Bok family rich by using foreknowledge to buy lottery tickets and stocks in the present that they knew would be winners in the future. The daughter Dong-hee can fly, an occasionally useful ability. The son, our protagonist Gwi-ju, can travel backwards in time. His daughter I-na can read minds.At the beginning of our tale, the Bok family has lost use of their powers. The mother cannot sleep and has no dreams, the daughter is too heavy from overeating to fly, the son is too depressed to time travel, and his daughter I-na is keeping her mind reading under wraps because she finds what people think to be disturbing.And the gang of scammers has identified that the Boks are malfunctioning and decide they can scam the family and get rich. To implement their scam they get our heroine Da-hae accepted as help into the Bok family, where the Bok family finds her to be an antidote to their despondency. She becomes key to the Boks' recovery from anarchy.That is the set up, and the rest of the tale is the uneven progress of the two families and the evolution of the feelings between Gwi-ju and Da-hae.The acting here is convincing, and there are many heartfelt moments that keep things going. So I was engaged. But I found the story confusing because it keeps shifting gears. The role of the superpowers keeps changing, so their uses are disconcertingly redefined as things move along.At first the mother's dreams predict the future. Later they are only suggestive of the future. At first the son can travel backward in time, but only as an observer. Later he can bring information from the present back with him to earlier times, where that information can be made use of to change the present when it arrives.The other confusion which is at the basis of the tale is that Gwi-ju is determined to travel backwards in time to long years ago to save Da-hae when she was trapped in a fire when very young. Why that was necessary is unclear because, as Da-hae points out to Gwi-ju, here she is in the present, so obviously she was saved from the long-ago fire.Suddenly the plot changes and the fire is now, or is it? And Gwi-ju is killed in the fire. Or was he?By and large the story is engaging. The actors do well. But the trajectory of the tale is erratic and seems to rewrite the plot capriciously time and again.

tt32166552,"TLDR; 10/10 unique, time-traveling, fantasy plot with stunning music, cinematography, and acting. Pacing is quick and you never feel bored. Main couple has me kicking my feet and giggling, while crying at the same time. Probably one of my favorite kdramas of all time.Highly underrated. Whoever gave this series a bad review clearly didn't bother to watch past the 1st episode. This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review for a kdrama in my life. I think it's because something about this series makes me strangely emotional even though it's not necessarily a sad story? This series brings me a lot of happiness.Initially the unique plot made me interested in starting it, but the pacing of the story, the characters, and chemistry of the main couple got me absolutely hooked.The casting is immaculate, I've never watched Jang Kiyong's older projects before as the plots never really interested me and I knew Chun Woohee was known for her film acting, but both were rather new to me. But wow, the emotional scenes hit hard. Chun Woohee's acting makes me choke up and the music!!! The OSTs in this series is magical and along with the cinematography it immerses me in the scene and the emotions. The chemistry of the main couple is too good and the romance is well-developed. I love how the writers take their time, but by no means does anything ever feel slow.I love all the characters in this story. Every character has their own color and somehow remains likeable to me despite their flaws (even the loan shark lady!).

tt32166552,"It's hard to believe a story about a family with superpowers could be so boring. With a couple of exceptions:What I liked:1. The special effects were good. Don't want to give it away, so I won't mention specifics.2. I really liked Bok Dong-hee, Gwi-ju's sister. She was hilarious and charming.3. The father, Oh Man-seok, also plays the dad in SOMETHING ABOUT THE RAIN.One of the reasons I like Oh Man-seok, other than his eternally cheerful demeanor, is because he's one of the few Korean actors in a major series with less than a lily-white complexion. Hey, Netflix, how about more brown-skinned Asian actors in your series? Thanks.4. A great, satisfying ending.What I didn't like:1. My main problem is that this series lacks any logical coherence. Why is there an elaborate wedding--with no guests--mind you, when A) the groom didn't actually propose, and B) the bride never accepted the non-proposal? Did either of these two ever say ""I love you""? Did I miss something? This is the stiffest, least-convincing marriage ceremony I've ever seen.And each person in the family is aware that the marriage is a fraud, and an attempt to steal their money. And everybody goes along with it. Really?2. Then there's the matter of the brother, Gwi-ju, who apparently needs to ""save"" someone. While at first, Gwi-ju is out to ""save"" a dude that he worked with, suddenly the target of his obsession changes.He's now set on ""saving"" Do Da-hae, a woman who's moved into the house under suspicious circumstances.But as Ms. Do points out to Gwi--ju, in a rare display of logical thinking--rare for this series anyway, she actually doesn't need saving as she's a healthy, fully functioning woman. Therefore she must have survived whatever horrible, no good, very bad thing happened to her in the past. You know, that thing that Gwi-ju has a bee in his bonnet about.3. Firemen don't stand around giving speeches to someone they're trying to save while the building's going down-but someone does that in this drama.4. The actress who plays Gwi-ju's daughter is adorable, but the romance between the character she plays and the most popular boy in the school is, well, hard to believe. This is middle school, folks.TO BE CONTINUED...
*************
Later: This series is so illogical it's impossible to suspend belief or care about anyone in this family. A couple of questions:4. What exactly are the rules for Bok Gwi-joo's superpower? At first, he can only revisit times when he was happy-until Do Da-hae enters the picture. Then the rule changes: he can only revisit happy times when he was with her. But then the rule changes again-he goes back to a happy moment he shared with his classmates, without Do Da-hae. Then it changes again, he watches a happy moment between his mom and dad-but wait! A very young Do Da-hae rides by on her bike. Whaaa?It sure feels like the writers made it all up as they went along.5. What side of his neck is Bok Gwi-joo's mark on? Is it on the left? Is it on the right? On both sides? ""They say it will never go away."" Who said that? I don't remember anyone consulting a doctor.6. Are we to believe that certain characters go about setting up an elaborate bogus accident in the middle of the day on a well-traveled coastal road-and nobody sees them? No cars, bikes, or pedestrians?The ending made up for a lot...but, but, but...why couldn't Mr. Time Travel come back on his own recognizance?

However, I also couldn't help but pity Bok I-na because her father couldn't change for her, as he was only motivated to change himself after meeting Do Da-hae. Like it was sad! But I was glad that Do Da-hae kept pushing him to think about his family. My favourite thing about this show wasn't even the romance.

The story line flips back and forth of both families knowing and not knowing why the two main characters should be together but still depends on the female lead. The male lead is very annoying to the point of stalking despite the belief its better for everyone for the two main characters to be together. Its the way the script was written. Anyone in their right mind would be upset that someone keeps following them despite many time being told to stay away. Nevertheless, not much 'superpowers' shown as reason is told in the beginning. The plot is not written as well and the direction of the movie starts to waver after each episode. Again, to each their own! It could have been written better.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
tt32166552,"**A Refreshing Korean Drama with Originality and Depth**After being bored with the repetitive and cliché storylines of many Korean dramas, I finally found a drama that stands out with its originality, strong storytelling, and unique character development. This drama presents superpowers in a refreshing way, diverging from typical portrayals. It delves into mental health, socio-economic challenges, family dynamics, relationships, and the concept of destiny, exploring how we perceive and respond to it.Despite mixed reviews, I guarantee that those who dislike this drama likely don't grasp its essence. It's not for fans of conventional romance dramas, love triangles, wealth struggles, or standard fantasy plots. Instead, it caters to viewers who enjoy time travel, fantasy, power dynamics, and time paradoxes. If you have the mental acuity to understand its intricate plot, you'll appreciate the genius behind its writing. This drama is rewatchable, packed with easter eggs and details that spark engaging theories and discussions. Criticism that it ""doesn't make sense"" often stems from a lack of understanding, not a flaw in the drama itself. It simply isn't aimed at those seeking mainstream narratives.In essence, this drama is simple, relaxing, and fun. It boldly portrays an unconventional family, a deeply depressed male lead, and a female lead who is a cheat, defying typical sad drama tropes. It's incredibly engaging from the very first episode.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
tt32166552,"The series takes its time. But somewhere along the way it pulled me in hard with its meandering time-bending strangeness. Definitely there's an undertow thing happening with every black & white shot glimpse into characters' recurring dreamscapes and nightmares. I'm at episode 8 now, and I'm guessing that those who are reviewing this drama as ""Boring"" probably swam to shore very early. Honestly, it took about 4 episodes before the dramatic undertow broke down my ""you've got to be kidding me"" barriers.Bottom line is it's not a show for a k-drama beginner.: It would tigger too much crazy-making culture shock. But once you've seen a lot of k-dramas, you get used to a lot of really strange stuff. Like how a tiny 12 yr. Old girl, who seems to be legally blind without her glasses, is allowed to walk to school (and all over the whole darn city) ALONE.But if you can get past the clueless child neglect, ""Atypical Family"" might just pull you in like it did me. Btw, This is maybe a 7 star series, but I gave a full extra star for the top-notch performance of Jang Ki-yong, who plays time travelling Gwi-joo. His character slowly sheds his comatose stone-coldness, frays and unravels, then unleashes a range of nuanced and cagey emotions. Jang's 4D acting definitely unveils itself as a cut above his costars, whose emotive capacities are either borderline passive, over-the-top, comic-bookish or just blah. (The actress who plays Grace deserves a small shout-out too. She's a cool combo of sly and fierce.) Anyway since the whole super-power thing was slow getting started, maybe we get a cliff hanger and a Season 2? I Hope so.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

tt32166552,"Move over, typical superhero stories! ""The Atypical Family"" redefines the genre with its sharp, witty take on superpowers clashing with real-life struggles. This 12-episode drama deftly avoids the usual pitfalls of drawn-out storyline and unnecessary side plots.Let's talk plot: Depression, obesity, insomnia-yup, they hit our heroes too. Who knew superheroes could be so... relatable? Gwi-ju's time-hopping adventures are a visual treat, thanks to some killer color grading. The past and future twist together in a way that makes time feel like a playground, showing us destiny isn't set in stone. And that chemistry between the leads? Pure, swoon-worthy magic. Real, raw, and refreshingly natural.The background score? An absolute vibe. Soothing, calming, and hitting all the right notes to tug at your heartstrings. But let's get real: Gwi-ju's haircut? Total misfire - Post-depression makeover? Nonexistent. I mean, I've got love for him, but - Do Da-Hae stole the spotlight in this one. She's the real MVP of the show, hands down.Skipping the whole ""we met as kids'' cliché would've been nice, though the show handled it better than most. The final scene where Do Da-Hae doesn't move away from a falling wall? I get you but girllll, you've got a kid to protect! Well, every drama has its hiccups.Watching Do Da Hae's family morph from shady to shiny is pure character development gold. No real villains here, just complex people getting their acts together. Ji-Han causing chaos? Again just an accidental anti-hero.I-Na growing up? Acknowledged without the unnecessary makeover. And let's not forget the adorable surprise of baby Nu-ri -- instant heart-melter. What a great piece that ditches the drag and keeps the sass.

tt32166552,"My 1st review for iMDB b/c I was so struck by this show.This show takes some common character archetypes but gives them surprising twists: a rich family of people with superpowers, but instead of running wild with using their superpowers for happiness, each is profoundly tortured and broken by them; a scheming gold-digging con-artist who is paralyzed by her real affection for her victim; the predator is actually a past victim. Nothing is as it seems because each character is used to show us the touching, human side of each character.Similarly, each plot twist is not what is expected, and the viewer is constantly surprised by each successive beautiful facet of each character that is slowly revealed as the show progresses.I must admit I wasn't sure I'd continue the show after the first episode. However, with each episode, the viewer gets pulled deeper into the twists and turns that have you rooting for every character, even the villains.I won't give any spoilers because each twist and turn, each layer of the onion that is peeled away reveals a beautiful humanness that is such a pleasure to watch, and I don't want to rob the viewer of the joy each episode brings.Even when I expected the last episode to be a cliché wrap up of the show that simply ties up all the loose ends in a boring, pro forma conclusion, the show keeps turning out new twists that make even the end a surprise,A warm-hearted show that made me sad that it ended because it was so good.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows.

I won't spoil anything, but I'll give my thought on some of the different aspects of the show.The story (10/10):This show grabbed a hold of me within the first minutes. The beginning really set the atmosphere and painted the main character as a cold, calculated and mysterious person. I mean; who does not like a beginning that glues you to the screen right away. I have to be honest and say that I binged the whole show in a week due to the never ending captivity of Vincenzo and the story that unfolds around him. I'm hope I'm not biased, but this show had me from start to finish and for that I have to give the story, a top rating.The characters: (10/10)
As the show goes on, we get to know all the different characters, their personas, their believes and what their values are. All the characters are great and gives the show a perfect balance of excitement, comedy and sadness. I can honestly say that I was just as interested in Vincenzo as I was in the other characters. They all had their story unfold like a present thought out the show.The protagonists were great, the antagonists were very good and all the other side-characters were interesting. What more can you ask for?The music: (10/10)There is nothing more to say than ""Bellissimo!"" The music was used in a perfect manner, the choice of songs at certain moments were spot on and they really gave the show a good feeling of Italian and Korean. Much respect the the people who worked on the music for this show.This might seem like a very biased review, but I still can't shake the feeling I'm left with, now that I've finished the show. I want to watch it again! I want to experience the opening sequence, I want to hear the music and I want to see how it ends all over again! Brilliant show! Just brilliant! If you haven't watched it, then do it! I promise you won't regret it. I laughed, I cringed, I cried and I enjoyed my way thought this masterpiece!

tt13433812,"I'm not sure how many times I have to repeat myself. I'm a writer of eight novels, and one of the most basic elements of writing is that you never sacrifice character for the sake of the plot. In other words, you don't make a character do something that goes against the character in order to make the plot work. And writer Park Jae Bum makes a very rookie mistake in Episode 19 that carries over into Episode 20.For the most part, Vincenzo is an impeccable series that is nearly flawless until those terrible 20-25 minutes-the end of Episode 19 and into Episode 20. We are extremely fortunate that this doesn't ruin the series. As I said in the series ""Mad For Each Other,"" if you ruin the ending of a series, you destroy the series itself.Vincenzo is a character on par with Jason Bourne or dare I say it-Batman (the comic character, not the live-action depictions) in which he's like a grandmaster chess player. He's always two or three moves ahead of his enemies. He's also a master of assessing a situation and making the smart choice, not to mention his nearly infallible ability to predict what will happen next based on his enemies' last move.Choi Myung Hee has just arranged for herself to take the fall for Jang Han Seok. Despite the fact that we know why she's doing it, it should be equally obvious to a character like Vincenzo. And yet, neither he nor Hong Cha Young can see the obvious: that it's to get Jang Han Seok out of prison. That was rookie mistake #1 by Park Jae BumJang Han Seok has abducted Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo is purposely brought to Jang Han Seok's house in order to kill him. During the ensuing struggle as Jang Han Seok's brother-Jang Han Seo-jumps him. Rather than helping Jang Han Seo subdue Jang Han Seok-who has a gun-Vincenzo rushes to free Hong Cha Young instead. Vincenzo would never do that. He would realize that the best way to keep Hong Cha Young's safety-as well as Jang Han Seo-is to help Jang Han Seo take out Jang Han Seok. Now, if in the ensuing struggle, Jang Han Seok manages to escape, that's all right. But I sighed with disgust when Vincenzo rushes over to Hong Cha Young instead. He would know that the best way to protect her would be to disable and take out Jang Han Seok. That was awful. And again, it's something Vincenzo would never do. It goes against the intelligence and nature of the character himself.Things briefly go from bad to worse as Vincenzo, who is now tending to the wounded Hong Cha Young, is literally watching the two brothers struggle with the gun-and only a few feet away-he still doesn't rush to help Jang Han Seo. He sits and watches. Again, I was rolling my eyes with disgust at how ridiculous the entire scenario played out. It was obvious that they wanted Jang Han Seok to escape to set up the showdown for the rest of Episode 20.As I said, the series was running smoothly, for the most part. Aside from some inconsistencies from the residents of the plaza and their fighting abilities as they go from an inability to fight to suddenly being experts, even though the so-called boxing winner can't even throw a punch mirroring an actual boxer (a true boxer would know how!) the series runs like a fine oiled machine.One more small issue--which most movies and shows take extreme liberties--is moving the gold bars. We see the bars being put into a piano, taken around in pockets and bags, sometimes 3-4 bars at a time. Gold bars weigh over 27 pounds each! (12.4 kilograms). While it made for some funny moments, it was highly unrealistic.It's difficult to pen down the actual genre of this series, which often plays out like a black comedy and then transitions into a drama-thriller and then back again. I've marveled at the Koreans' ability to fluctuate and do it seamlessly. It speaks to the genius of their writers, despite Park Jae Bum's lapse in judgment and writing ability.Vincenzo is a Korean-Italian consigliere-essentially one of the highest ranks in the mafia aside from the head man himself. He makes no apologies for his methods of dealing with those who would prey upon the weak and the helpless, and he brings his own sense of ""justice"" to bear against anyone-from lowly thugs to those sitting in power, bathed in corruption. Little do these people in power know who or what they are up against, nor do they realize what Vincenzo is capable of until it's too late. It's like watching very good chess players who think they can hold their own-finally meeting their match against a grandmaster. Vincenzo easily exposes their inabilities, and they find out soon enough that Vincenzo isn't someone who makes idle threats. He means to do exactly what he says he'll do. Jang Han Seok and his nasty den of lieutenants look at Vincenzo and laugh as though he's just some character in a movie. But he outplays them and outdoes them at every turn.""24""'s Jack Bauer-a special field agent for the Counter-terrorist unit once tells a panel of senators, ""It's sad that we live in a world where someone like me is necessary to do what needs to be done."" Vincenzo is of the same ilk. The higher-ups in corporations and political machinations believe they are all but untouchable and that they can do whatever they want. Someone like Vincenzo is able to prove to them just how wrong they are. But it also takes someone like Vincenzo to deal with them in complete and unforgiving ways.I have always marveled at characters who are smart. I love Jason Bourne because of his ability to outthink his opponents. Batman is the same. And Vincenzo has those same qualities. Oh, he can fight and hold his own, but it's his wits that make him formidable and such an iconic character. Song Joong Ki masterfully plays Vincenzo-who at times-seems light and almost playful, and other times as an absolutely scary opponent you would never dare cross if you understood him and what he's capable of doing. He doesn't play Vincenzo as a simple thug. And despite his background, Vincenzo becomes attached to the people of the plaza and will do whatever it takes to protect them. He calls himself a ""villain"" and yes, he often comes across that way, but he's essentially a good man who simply finds himself using terrible methods to get the job done. Much like Jack Bauer, as I stated above.The entire cast was nothing short of fantastic, and if it had not been for the major letdown of those 20-25 minutes, this series would have easily been a ""10"" for me. But, alas, those minutes put a big dent into a story that was running along so smoothly and so effortlessly. It's just too bad that the ball was dropped temporarily. Still, it doesn't torpedo the series, and it's definitely worth a look. It's not as great or as tautly written as ""My Name"" or ""Stranger"" but it's most certainly good enough.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Yes good pacing can sometime do great, like how it hyped people's feelin when Joon Woo show off his identity (uwu gud stuff). But what's unforgivetable is how it breaks the beautiful setting that this show provided. We all know lucky moments and coincidences are sometime acceptable as it's reasonable to happen and will only make the scenes more awesome. But bruh not in this case, bc they freakin spammed it! The amount of oopsie moments that were created only for the shake of helping the protagonist and his companions are immesurable. Remember how Vincenzo and plaza owner closed the shelter's door right on time in ep ? Or when he arrive just b4 main girl of the show have her face punched? These little but ugly details totally ruined my experience as it's bland out unrealistic.Secondly: Weak character building followed up by weak script. Seriously, Paolo the gangster boss is nothing but a bullied child who dare do nothing, even can't take revenge on Vincenzo's driver when his master is abroad. And I was totally dissapointed seeing how Vincenzo easily kidnapped, tortured, got information from frankly any bad guys. It's like his aura of a normal build little baby face man and some weak measures of suffering could scare the f*ck out of everyone. Not to say no guard or security plan is effective against a korean mafia boy who works alone to invade Babel's domain and employees. Also, the poducers liked to spam backup saveboats that litterally turns the tide of the show. Oh Vincenzo is in trouble? Don't worry, he's rich and knows martial art at a superior rate! Oh plaza civilians are in danger? Don't care cause all of them know how to fight, and some are even masters of brawls. And you won't need me to speak out loud how trashy nerfed Ant Company was, right? (Although I hate it when the members of goverment and important people keep showing up to help willingly for no particular reason more)
Hmm, at this rate I think further criticism is unnecessary as you may've all now capable of looking at that overrated mess called Binsenjo Cassanova with a more precise perspective. For me myself, well the only reason I watched it to the end is 'cause of Joon Woo's actin, plot and role (as it's acted brilliantly with some manners of being the most realisticccc and No.1 part of the whole show uwu)

tt13433812,"I've watched Vincenzo until ep.18 (out of 20), so I guess it's already acceptable for me to write a review. My feeling about this series : unfortunately, really really disappointed.The reason why I watched this series is because I was intrigued by the genre : a mixture between politic, thriller, action, and comedy. The first few episodes are quite fun. But that fun only last for approximately the first 10 episodes. Even in the first 10 episodes, I already found several issues that bothered me. For example, why is Cha-Young fighting against her dad in the first place? There's no backstory whatsoever about why she chose to work in Woosang despite how corrupted Woosang is (only for the money? I dunno). Then, there's Myung-Hee. What is her motive? What is the reason for her total support for Han-Seok despite their constant losing? Is she just downright 'evil'? And for Han Seok, I just can't believe the writer just explained his character as a psychopath. Don't tell me that this is not a lazy way to create an antagonist character.What annoyed me the most is actually what she and Han Seok keep on doing every single episode : an empty threat ""You'll regret it"", ""What if I kill you first?"" blah blah. Their method of winning is apparently : A doesn't want to cooperate? Kill A. B knows something he/she shouldn't? Kill B. C is acting annoying? Kill C.But of course Vincenzo will always outsmart them and win. If this only happens for like 2/3 episodes, I won't be so annoyed. But this pattern of handsome-and-perfect main lead that keeps winning against the 'bad guys', no matter how cliché it is (yes, Inzaghi, I see you), for every single episode, is just.. underwhelming.Han Seo is at least a more interesting character than Myung Hee or Han Seok. He shows change : once a shadow for his brother and was always afraid of him, but now finally has courage to fight against him and even becoming wittier.I mean, this series can be great, with a proper storyline. Probably a less perfect Vincenzo that can make mistakes sometimes. Probably a smarter and cunning antagonist that's actually 'do' something instead of just talking big and failed miserably..Don't get me wrong, I love the actors and actress. They saved the show. They saved the poor and lazy story writing. That's why I give the rating of 5 : despite the meh story writing, the CGI of Italy (and Inzaghi apparently) is beautiful and realistic, some of the comedic scene is quite funny, the cinematography is amazing, and the music they choose do compliments the atmosphere.But, in the end, nothing can really save a poor story.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"This show has the best of everything. It has action, comedy, just the right amount of romance, and incredible characters. You even find yourself loving the villain because the actor is that good. Jang Han-Soek and Vincenzo are great because they are both villains. There is no real good guy or bad guy.

His acting is maturing and gets more seasoned in each progressive show. Dunno how he's got such flawless skin, but definitely a joy to watch.

Well-written, charming and a straight up overpowered badass, he takes on multiple foes using his wit and experience as a mafia accompanied by a great cast of side characters who are equally as likeable.The show touches on the subject of human greed and Vincenzo must deliver Justice while at the same time tries to grow into a more humble person despite his past life.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

tt13433812,"Korean Drama "" Vincenzo "" had a good concept but there were times that it didn't make it work.The main problem with this drama is the length. It's not only twenty episodes long, each episode also was about an hour and twenty minutes. However, the story was not for that length. Therefore, there were episodes, especially the final ones, when the story was full of fillers, unnecessary twists, and ridiculous situations that were trying too hard to be funny. The blend, though, of action, comedy, and legal themes was an interesting combination that worked for most of the cases. Most of the characters were also pretty interesting, though some of them, like the piano lady and the female lead, were annoying and it was obvious that they were written to be eccentric, but that was presented in a way that screamed try-hard. The villain was a boring character in the second half of the drama. However, it must be noted that the big twist was an innovative one and pretty entertaining.As for the performances, everyone did a great job, especially the male lead who finally found the right character for his proper comeback after the big hit DOTS.So, overall, six out of ten.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The audience tends to give perfect 10/10 ratings, making it difficult to find unbiased reviews, seeking a fair evaluation is futile, as everything is hailed as a ""must-see"" and the ""best drama"" of the year.The crime/mafia theme falls short, with the main character failing to convincingly portray a mafia figure, I even find him cringe. Excessive use of plot armor is overwhelming. The ML is depicted as smart character, but when plot armor is needed he suddenly lost his brain.The FL character lacks development. Despite being a supposed top lawyer defending a company that has a lot of dark secrets, she consistently depends on the ML. Her character is no different from a sidekick.The most interesting characters are probably the Jang brothers. Especially Han Seo. However, his death felt cheap. I understand the desire for emotional impact, but it could have been more purposeful. His death didn't contribute to the plot, could have been prevented, and left a gap in the ML's character. Some might argue that it makes him (the ML) human and realistic, but come on... From the first episode until the last, when has his character ever been portrayed as realistic?The show's world-building is almost childish. An intelligence organization fails to notice a mafia member's activities, despite his interference with prominent people. The person investigating him becomes a fan, the agency chief becomes a pawn, even the Interpol is being depicted as joke. The justice system is easily manipulated by ML, making it hard to believe. They didn't success in making him a smart character but rather went ahead and lowered the IQ of his enemies and law enforcement.The only redeeming aspects are good looking people dressing to impress.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The end of each episode is funny and something outrageous usually happens to get you to tune in to the next episode. The first episode was strong with the contrast between how he deals with bad guys in Italy and Korea. Timely nod to Purdue Pharma narcotic issues in episode 3. Episode 4 is quite grand and past things come together.The bad part is subsequently the humour is often painful and the unnecessary overacting of Jeon Yeo Bin is hard to watch. Ok Taecyeon is almost unrecognisable as the goofy intern but his hairstyle changes as he does. Excellent supporting actor Kwak Dong Yeon is a memorable here as a bad guy.I'm still hoping the series will get better and things will get funnier and less painful. They try for jokes when it isn't necessary and it often fails. Even Itaewon Class was funnier and it wasn't mainly a comedy because they reserved jokes for when it counted.

tt13433812,"8/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Action and Crime drama with 20, approximately 80 minute episodes.Park Joo-hyung (Song Joong-ki) grew up in Italy. At eight years old he was adopted and harbors resentment towards his Korean mother who he feels abandoned him. He later becomes part of the Italian mafia and is such an asset the head, Don Fabio, adopts him. As a member of the Cassano family Joo-hyung is renamed Vincenzo Cassano. He becomes a lawyer and utilizes his skill as he works as a representative for his adopted father in mafia dealings. When the father dies, the biological son attempt to kill Vincenzo and, after taking revenge, Vencenzo flees the country back to South Korea.In Seoul, Vincenzo goes to the the Geumga Plaza which is a site where he helped a Chinese tycoon hide 1.5 tons of gold and install tenants to disguise the real intention of the building.The Chinese tycooln is dead, and ownership of the gold now falls to the Cassano family, and Vincenzo plans to recover the gold for himself. Of course, the building has been taken over by a South Korean crime organization in the form of a pharmaceudical company, the Babel group. The Babel group has been strong arming the tenants so Vincenzo decides to team up with one of the tenants, a lawyer, to take down the Babel group. The lawyers daughter, Hong Cha-young (Jeno Yeo-been) was originally represting Babel but after her father is murdered by them, joins up with Vincenzo to exact revenge on the Babel Group. Sparks had originally flown between the two but as they unite toward a common purpose those strong feelings evolve to something more.Overall, I liked this series a lot. All of the actors, and you had a pretty much all star cast with a few exceptions, did an amazing job acting out their characters. The storyline was exciting and the villians were incredibaly villanous. The whole ""it takes a villian to catch a villian"" axiom was true throughout the series. The chemistry between the two leads was not immediate, which made sense to me because they did not start out liking each other but developed a deep friendship through working to take down a common enemy.*Spoilers The pros were the incredible acting, great locations and filming, and appropriate but not too invasive musical scores. Who doesn't love Song Joon-ki in action, he is incredibly handsome and charasmatic. The sense of community with the building tenants was both refreshing and engaging. I loved that Cha-young was a tough, no nonsense lawyer with a bit of a dark streak. It made her the perfect pairing for Vincenzo because she did not have an issue, if justice would not be served, with going outside of the law. I loved that there was gold hidden in the building and how disturbed Vincenzo would get whenever someone would pursue his gold. He reminded me, in those cases, of a Leprechaun guarding his gold. One of the most comedic scenes was when he had to pretend to be gay to lure in a bank that was willing to work with Babel. Whether you are gay trying to be heterosexual or heteresexual tying to be gay if you are engaging the sexuality that does not fit - it is cringy. I was laughing, so hard during that part. The funny thing, was he seemed to turn all the guys around him gay. The men seemed to love him as much as the women did. It was like everyone's dark fantasy, apprently, to be in the mob. So there were bromances galore.The cons were the times that Vincenzo failed to stay true to character. What it seemed, was he was a South Korean child, adopted into the Italian culture but was old enough to remember the language and most of the culture of his original country. His anger at his mother for ""abandoning"" him, and the death of his foster parents through criminal activity, led him to embrace the dark side for revenge. I got that. Made sense. But, it showed, in so many ways that he was very humane and caring and had conscience and could love and all that - not even a sociopath because he wasn't simply ""blending in"" his feelings appeared genuine and he underwent an evolution through meeting and falling in love with Cha-young, being mentored and befriended by her father, and just forming so many friendships in South Korea. But then, his mother, who he was on the precipice of a true reunion with, is murdered and it is like it flipped a switch. He backtracked on all the progress he made and the brutal element fully came back in him. The fact that he had flashbacks and nightmares of past incidents clearly showed that he had remorse to that point. But then it was like he became a slightly different person after his mother's death. I thought the way he killed the Babel villians was just a bridge too far. I cannot reconcile burning someone to death with someone who is a good person. Although the chairman was evil and had done horrible things, drilling someone to death is just the next level of brutality. Becoming as evil as the evil you are punishing does not make you a good person. I was disappointed when he blew up Cha-young's father's killer. He broke his word in my opinion. HHe told him once he did this thing the debt was fulfilled and he could go free. It was dishonest and it seemed even Cha-young felt he had gone too far. But she never said that although her response to the news seemed as if it bothered her.When he killed the female lawyer he broke his morale code which was no women and children. She even said you are going to do this to a woman and he said, basically, you are not a woman, you are a monster. Still, burning her alive was the next level up brutality. It took him from a batman like, superhero justice seeker, to just a murderer little better than the people he was ""punishing"". I also could not buy that the law enforcement friends in his circle were so okay with him brutally murdering those people. They helped him get away with it and even shook hands with and hugged him when he had the blood on him. It was a bit like ""Dexter"" in that dark anti hero type persona but I am just not a fan of that level of ""eye for an eye"" because his treatment of them was even more brutal than the way they treated their victims.The ending also fell short for me. Perhaps they are setting it up for another season. I did not like the very ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" end where he can only come back when on a diplomatic mission (diplomatic immunity). It was over obvious in the postcards he sent that he wanted her to come find him - yet she didn't. To me it seemed as though her emotions toward him took a turn. I did not have the sense she would be willing to leave South Korea and go join him on an island off the coast of Malta. I had no care for his Italian family. We never got to know enough of that piece to care that he had reunited and was now ruling that family. And, we were reminded of his brutality when he mentioned the revenge he took on a rival family and that their remains were fertilizing his grapes. They confessed and kissed but then parted ways with a somewhat sad and whistful look in both of their eyes.His behavior, as other reviewers have pointed out, was not even consistent with what is often the case in organized crime. I knew a situation like that once - one of my best friends in high school let's just say her father was a retired person in a very well known organized criminal entity. In those situations, usually the lawyer is very valuable and also high up in the crime organization. They do not have those folks act as ""hit persons"" they are too valuable to the organization. And they typically have done their dues and don't want to get their hands dirty that way. Not that they have suddenly grown a conscience, but they just don't do the dirty work anymore. So that did not make sense. He was a lawyer and the second in command - the family would typically not risk such an individual by involving them so intimately. Even if he, himself, wanted to be involved, unless there was a compelling reason he would usually be ordered by ""the boss"" not to.That being said - I would still recommend it and might even rewatch it at some point. It is unique and so well acted that the flaws are not a complete deterrant. Others really liked it and did not consider these things flaws. Cha-young had just enough darkness in her to accept a lot of what he did. It was very ""Game of Thrones"" in the darker elements and how most of the characters were not completely good or completely evil but various mixes thereof. And how you were rooting for anti heroes. The ""Queen of Dragons"" in Game of Thrones reminded me of Vincenzo in the way their characters evolved and the sudden switch down a much darker path. But I wasn't a fan of how that ended either. I like redemption and character growth. This followed the opposite trajectory. If there were a second season I might watch it. I am extremely disappointed in the brutality of the murders so I can't think of a way back from that but would be interested to see where their relationship evolved.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"Best kdrama I've ever watched, the performances are good and make me laugh for having good humor, the intelligence of the characters are captivating, the construction of the series was very well elaborated. The jokes are very well used and are not made every 2 minutes, the director and his colleagues knew how to enjoy each episode, I could say that the real president of Babel made an extraordinary revelation and that at no time did I think it would be him, his personality change and the way he showed interest in every moment after the revelation was unique and the actor is to be congratulated for his performance.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

However I personally think this show has a perfect balance of thriller, action, comedy and suspense. Those who judge shows after watching 1 episode I think are rather stupid. Obviously you're not gonna fully grasp the characters in episode 1/20...that's why there's more episodes. The acting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography is great, some parts you're not supposed to take seriously because they're for comedic purposes. I love the character development too it's amazing. I also love the storyline and the idea of a Korean - Italian mafia...it's quite interesting. I don't wanna give away too much but at least watch til ep 3-4 til you judge. It's definitely worth watching. I like how the romance between the two leads isn't super cliché and isn't the main focus either but it's still there, it's more of a slow burn romance between them. The action scenes are well shot and quite realistic too. Omg I could go on and on about this show I love it so much.

tt13433812,"It was such a good series to have ended so open.After so many episodes, viewers would have liked to have some type of uplifting ending. So, this is my creation for a more ""fanciful"" ending.After leaving Korea, using the ""one year later"" time jump, Vincenzo - who has a wealth of information on corrupt dealings - has now been given some type of position with Interpol. He goes to the Korean-Italian conference and reunites with Hong Cha Young and they share that ""kiss moment"" under the stars and he leaves, only to return to Geumga Plaza and surprises all the quirky residents for some over the top sentimentality, with each resident having their own astonished encounter with Vincenzo. The Plaza and surrounding area is reborn so the city becomes revitalized thanks to the stash of gold that is being laundered and the funds are used just for that.Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo are married in the Buddhist Temple with the Plaza residents in attendance. They establish a law firm for those who have no political or social voice.In the revitalized building, Inzaghi the pigeon of karma returns to the window with...a family!I'm sure I missed a few other things, but I think viewers would have wanted that uplifting and well-done, tear-jerking finale.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"This is not a fan-friendly review. Although the series is not the best, it is a good series that several chapters can be rescued but not all. At first we are used to very long chapters, a bit empty, they have top moments that hook you but a thread is lost in the critical attention of those who see it. There are chapters that I consider to be really good like some initials and some endings, but 20 chapters are not necessary, chapters that if you skip, you will still understand the plot and you did not miss anything, clearly it is not a piece of art, because it does not have The best photograph is very long, there are characters that do not have nuances, such as the antagonist, who dehumanizes someone only to have feelings of evil, or to hook up with a character who practically only at the end realizes the love he feels for the girl , which we must question because at this point in history it is not healthy to continue having this type of concept about love as a couple. Now, there are chapters that are really good for the nuances of some characters, for the Korean humor, for the impeccability of the script, for the photography of some landscape scenes, for the costumes. But I insist that a maximum of 10 chapters would be good, not 20 because I feel that in addition to saying good, some are not so good but I already invested a considerable time I have to finish it to see the outcome that is anticipated in the acting of the characters from the initial chapters .The development of the relationship between the characters is seen throughout the story, but I question the way a character is idolized in this case a man in the role of savior. In short, it is not a bad criticism but a constructive and obvious one, I love this actor and many of his characters, I like many things about him as an actor and seeing many characters from other series that are still really incredible in their acting roles.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"This is one of the best shows I have watched in a long time. The writing, the casting, the flow, and the crossover between drama and comedy was genius.

tt13433812,"The show has a super handsome hero, perfect in all aspects, good to look at, rich, an attorney, well dressed, and that's just about it. There is nothing else going for the show. The female lead is also an attorney, but she behaves in the most un-lawyerly manner, more like a drama artist who routinely goes over the top when acting. The bounce in her gait had me flinching every time! Not only did she overact, she actually had very little to contribute to the story, no wonder the drama was named just after the male lead. Another headache were the silly tenants, who wasted most of the screen-time allotted to them. No offence to the actors(except the FL, of course), the actors were all good and I've seen a few of them in other shows acting well, perhaps the script written for them was unnecessarily loud and full of too-much-drama. The lead villain was too handsome to be cast in a negative role, and though his role was also written to be an over-the-top excessive one, he did justice to it. I happened to watch this show twice, once by myself and next time with my kids, and the second time I kept wondering why I endured it the first time :)
I cannot stop ranting about the FL though, was she some relative of a producer, and she had to be cast no matter what? If that's the case, it is understandable and my sympathies are with the casting team, but if not, then the casting team needs to really improve their practices, especially when they are casting someone opposite a stalwart like Song Joonki. And I pity Song Joonki for having to put up with the terrible acting of his female co-actor and some other actors, who could have been dropped from the show without making much difference.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

To be honest some things are predictable but still you can't create everything a new.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"I initially went into this drama not really sure what to expect, but hopeful to see how the plot of a K-drama would deal with a mafia element.For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed myself while watching the show, it really didn't begin to feel like it started to drag on until the last couple of episodes. I really did enjoy a lot of elements, but there were also some things I felt like could have used some work.PROS:
-- The acting was quite good, specifically (for me) the main villains Lawyer Choi and Chairman Han-Seok. The little nuances they did here and there in their body language, especially Han-Seok with his killer facial expression changes, was really enjoyable to watch.-- The Scenery was nice
-- A few of the plot points were quite funny (the ones that were done in a good way)
-- Multilingual (So many switches between Korean, Italian, English, and Mandarin I think at one point was very cool)CONS:
-- Vincenzo's ability to get out of almost every single problem with ease was quite frustrating for me at time, to the point where in the latter episodes I was literally hoping that the villains got the upper hand in some way. To me, I just found it very unbelievable that he was ALWAYS a step ahead or that he ALWAYS knew more skilled fighting techniques. Like, I get it, Vincenzo is supposed to be one of the most feared mafia men in Italy, but he's not a superhero so I just feel like losing a fight here and there would've humanized him in a good way.-- I didn't care for a few characters: mainly most of the ""good"" guys lol. The tenets we are supposed to be rooting for are incredibly annoying and self righteous at times in the beginning. Then towards the latter episodes, it's revealed that they all have some ""superpower"" that aids the lawyers in their quest for ""justice"". I also found it very frustrating that they were all able to hold their own against trained mercenaries and assassins. I didn't care for the ""muscle"" that the baddies kept hiring because they were cartoonish in their lack of know how when it came to hurting literally anyone besides themselves. And lastly the lawyer/leading lady the lawyer Cha-Yeoung. She seemed to annoy me to no end with her self-righteous haughty attitude when it came to the villains. She never lost a case when she worked for money, then when she worked for the side of ""justice"" she still never seemed to lose. I did enjoy her funny moments though and the development of her romance with Vincenzo.--The PIGEONS! I have to mention the pigeons coming to the aid of Vincenzo in his hour of need, distracting the gunmen long enough for him to get the upper hand again. That one moment literally made me drop a star in the rating, so out of place and forced and cringy.-- Lastly, the ending. Too unbelievable and DARK. Vincenzo went too far with how he punished Choi and Han-Seok. I didn't enjoy how they didn't stand a chance. Han-Seok is quite a large man, and there was no reason he should've been taken down so easily. None of the ""good"" guys died because once again they were more than capable of fighting off all the trained killers. Han-Seok stabbed Lee twice and the guy was fine, but he gets kicked in the face once and is knocked out long enough to be strapped (by Vincenzo alone) into a Russian mafia torture chair. I also found it hard to believe that the multiple cop cars literally stopped their pursuit of a wanted Vincenzo because a tiny car a little bigger than a smart car blocked the road. Then Vincenzo manages to get out of the country only to sneak back in for an art exhibition a year later with ease just to meet up with Cha-Yeong and finally admit to the audience that he is a villain. I just kept asking myself by this point, ""HOW IS NOONE ABLE TO CATCH THIS MAN? SURELY THE AUTHORITIES HAVE HIM BLACKLISTED FROM ENTERING INTO KOREA AT THIS POINT?!""Overall, I still enjoyed it though. It was a wild ride. The cards were clearly stacked for the main leads, but I just put that off on the sometimes cliche k-drama formula. It was still quite frustrating at times (to the point where I found myself rooting for a win for the bad guys sometimes), but I still like it enough to happily sit through 20 movie-length episodes.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

tt13433812,"I wanted so much for this to be a 10 star rating after watching the first episode. I was complete blown away by Song Joong Ki's multilingual abilities in playing Vincenzo, the real Italian backdrop, the international mafia storyline. It really seemed all so promising.However, all this comes to a lukewarm plateau in the next few episodes, where Vincenzo ends up in South Korea and begins executing his mission of extracting gold from the basement of a rundown shopping plaza. It was heartwarming to see the him be reacquainted with the Korean life he had left behind as an orphaned child adopted by Italian foster parents, but I had already been sold on the hard mafia opening in the beginning.What was most disturbing for me was that the entire series opened with the scene of him bombing the shopping plaza where the gold was hidden, but in the end, this was never realized. I was really looking forward to see how he would manage convincing the residents of the plaza to move out so that he could destruct the plaza and extract the gold, but this was never realized.In fact, the entire plot became lost in a mushy romantic comedy between him and Jeon Yeo been's quirky yet lovable character Hong Cha Young, instead of the international action thriller it promised to be in the first episode. It became a story of how an Italian Korean reenacted his love for his countrymen, and how much his countrymen revered the Italian mafia, rather than a high intensity shootout or face off between him and his enemies with Italian mafia involvement on both sides to increase the tension.At the end of it, I felt not only lost but deceived.

But all I got was a wannabe mafia or legal drama which had comedy all over the place. It wasn't even a proper mafia or legal drama as there were hardly any courtroom scenes or any real mafia elements. The writers dragged this show for way too many episodes and most of the times Vincenzo doesn't even think like a consigliere who worked for the mafia. Even after so many attempts of accidents and killing, he doesn't think that it's wise to hire more amount of bodyguards for the people who are close to him. There are so many incidents which he could have avoided if he actually behaved like a consigliere. In the ending of episode 19 suddenly Vincenzo was dumb and weak. If you are a fangirl/fanboy of the lead character then you will love this show. But if you wanted to see a well made show like ""Vagabond"" then this convuluted mess isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching the show because of the geumga plaza people and their comedy, but I was expecting something serious.

tt13433812,"How to best describe Vincenzo? On the surface it seems like the Godfather meets Korean drama and the premise looks promising. In practise, I can at best describe it as a strange mix of black comedy, mixed with action and horror elements. Truly a strange mix, which ends up being confusing and you end up on a rollercoaster, but one that is moving in all directions!The whole story did not make any sense and was far from credible and may be culturally insensitive. A Korean adoptee who can speak fluent Korean and Italian with a heavy Korean accent. Right...! The development of the characters was stale and the plot twists may be surprising, but totally ridiculous.The sub-plot where Vincenzo was gay baiting someone was truly offensive. In this time of inclusion, I found this highly cringe and insensitive. It may be normal for a Korean audience, but in the rest of the world this is not done.We see through the episodes the violence escalating. Where it starts relatively innocent, it escalates into something increasingly more gruesome and gore. Culminating in the torture and demise of the antagonists: stabbing in the neck where we see blood pouring out, live burning of a woman and the slowly drilling to death of the ""end boss"". It intends to shock and wrap up the story, but I found it unnecessary, unsatisfactory and out of context with the vibe of the other episodes.The acting of some characters was quite good though, notably the main protagonist Vincenzo (Song Joong-ki) and the antagonists Choi Myung-hee (Kim Yeo-jin), Jang Han-seo (Kwak Dong-yeon) and Jang Han-seok (Ok Taec-yeon). I can appreciate their performance. It is just that everything else was incoherent and a confusing mess.And what about the take home message of Vincenzo? There is no justice in this world.

More evidence, more bodies, more beytrals.And who knows what secrets and who doesn't is one of the keys to how the plot unfolds.Excellent handling so far. But how will it all end?********
**Update on ending**
Too neat. Everything fits but too... perfect for the good side. Because nothing in life is like that. Wraps up so neatly. Only works on paper.If the old men is so powerful, calculating and experienced, how come he's not that careful to suspect recording and being so emotional? Same with the prosecutor.Ending is always a conundrum. There should be some closure yet hard to be realistic.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

It is gaining momentum with each passing episode. I'm on episode 9 so far, waiting for more to come out. I highly recommend the series, it's very exciting. The acting is absolutely top notch. The storyline and story is very well done. Overall, really nothing to complain about. Although I'm still waiting for the next parts, I definitely won't change the rating. Really 10/10 stars for me.

The fact that it's so unpredictable, cope with great scripts, amazing acting, that by itself make it a 10 out of 10 for me. Believe me, there is so much to its arsenal. Smart, gritty, bloody, heart warming, heart wrenching, to name a few. Oh yeah let's assemble one of the most diverse and powerful casting I've seen so far, in a Korean fantasy show.

I have been watching korean series for some time and they are really good. And this one is one of the best. Normally, I fastforward some of the series if it gets a little bit boring and I have watched Death's Game without any fastforwarding. I hope there will be other series with this quality. Strongly recommend this series to everyone. I gave this series 10. I would give more if it was possible to do so.

It can never be predicted, not even a single episode , every episode has its unique touch , I wish this get acclaimed and hit more than any series ever , that much I loved it ,

tt26225038,"I'm happy I've been able to keep discovering new shows intermittently from South Korea. I watched a lot of SK horror and Park Chan-wook films for years before I even considered watching K-dramas. My experience of such were briefly gazing at the TVs in the jjimjilbang, which seemed constantly tuned to soap operas little old ladies were watching that looked no better than their American daytime television cousins. I dismissed K-drama as an art form as beholden to either the latter pattern, or alternately sappy shows for teens who are obsessed with pop stars.Fortunately there are intriguing and entertaining shows like Death's Game. I'm hooked on this one, to my surprise I actually caught a series in process and cannot binge watch this drama at will. I have to wait until January for the next episode! I recommend you join me.Park So-dam from Parasite plays Death, and she's wonderful.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Wow, the story is really good, even though it's a fantasy genre, it's still tense, creating a tense atmosphere. The story line is fresh, someone who has died many times and been reincarnated in the bodies of different people. This series also features other famous actors who are no less cool than the main character. One of the series at the end of this year with almost all of the players being visual. I like the setting of the scene which is quite pleasing to the eye, not monotonous, arranged in such a way that it doesn't feel boring. Honestly, usually I don't really like films with fantasy genre stories like this because it will be boring and there are too many talking scenes in each episode, but this series actually provides an interesting story because it has a touch of real, exciting action and also has a mystique that makes me want to keep watching. I hope there is second season.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Just when you thought you've seen everything,here comes a Kdrama that breaks every rule, by creating a situation never seen before in television...then turning said situation on its head. It has been said that in the catholic religion if someone commits suicide it means your automatically destined for hell, well in ""Death's Game"" it also means you are seeking an audience with the Grim Reaper, and Death thinks it's disrespectful to seek it out... so it punishes you by putting your poor soul into 12 different people that will inevitably die... all the while giving you hope that if you can some how beat said inevitable death you'll get a chance at life. Seems simple enough right? But you would be totally wrong if you think you can assume how all this will shake out. Worth it!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

Not only was the acting/character portrayal was amazing, but the lessons I got out of it hit me to the core. Effects wise was also jaw dropping. I would watch it again and again. Once you started watching the show, there's just no point of stopping. I wish they would release this to other streaming platforms so more people could watch it. How every episodes are connected and the twists revealed only showed that this was a well thought, well directed show. Worth binge watching it!!!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"After watching so many kdramas, and reaching episode 6 and then 7, I was pretty much convinced that this is no doubt the best Kdrama I have seen, and also among my all time top 20 shows. But episode 8 just ruined everything for me.The best parts.Show is thrilling, you can pretty much assume what will be the end because of the premises of the show, but that makes it no less thrilling as several different characters and how it all ties up is brilliantly done, top notch thing there. It was pretty much given that after all that suffering ML will be given another go at his own life, this time to make a different choice.But then again, the last episode negates everything and also sort of contradicts it's own message and premises. There's another review that mentions this and I couldn't agree more with it.First of all, after going through all that, coming back to his own life, and remembering everything that has happened, ofcourse he was gonna make a different choice. So that just kills the point of the show, anyone contemplating suicide, if he/she knows the consequences of it will obviously make a choice accordingly, there's no free will to choose here when you have already learnt what's gonna happen.Second thing , bringing him into the body of his own mother was just too weird for me to accept, I completely understand the point makers wanted to convey as to how people who are left behind, suffer. But it was unnecessary, as earlier we have seen how his mother and Ji Su have suffered following his suicide.Along with this there are major plotholes. As now at the end our ML is brought back to the point where he commits suicide, and now he decides not to and the show just ends. But what now, will he be able stop the psychopath painter cum serial killer ? Will he decide to go against the rich heir who is also another psychopath killer in the making ? Will his gf die again ? Because according to death that was always supposed to happen that way, but would she be on the road if it wasn't for the soul of her dead bf now in the body of a model who was walking her back home and stopped midway to tell the story ? But death says she never lies and this is how his gf was supposed to die. But if now the ML never commits suicide , she wouldn't be at that point.And the other lives? The guy in plane, the schoolboy, the cop, the old homeless guy, the model etc etc. They all got to their point of death because ML soul was inside them. What's gonna happen to all that ?All of this never happened, and the ML was either just dreaming or forgets everything in the end, which makes the entire show even more pointless.Or he remembers, but how all the events through the show will take place if ML never commits suicide?The makers botched everything up with last episode.A much better ending would've been where it all started, and not where ML commits suicide. But when several years back, the second last life of ML was inside a middle age guy who runs on the road to get killed by the rich guy, that triggers the psychopath in him, and also is the starting point of where ML life starts to go down.The ML never commits suicide, he never ends up in the body of middle age person, never runs in the middle of the road, never the ML trembles and fails his interview, and he never gets to the point where he has to commit suicide. That's where and how the cycle began and should have ended.Again the show was good upto a point. But got completely ruined by the way it ended. Leaving several plotholes and contradictions. There have been other shows about suicide, which makes similar point, one is Tomorrow of Rowoon, and it deals with this point in much better way. Or there have been shows where the ML dies, but is given another chance to do different and better, such as Reborn Rich and Again my Life.The makers tried to do both points here and ended by ruining the show.I wouldn't recommend the show. Watch it only if you have nothing else to watch.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"This show is phenomenal! It is a must-watch for its cutting-edge storytelling (based on the acclaimed webtoon) and intense emotional journey. But viewer discretion is advised for its stark portrayal of death, suicide, and related disturbing content.It is a gripping psychological K-thriller along the lines of Netflix's The Glory. The work probes into dark themes related to the struggle to survive. It explores mortality, love, family, and regret. The suspense waiting for the lead's next demise is balanced with gallows humor, and there is tremendous emotional depth to the story.The production features an ensemble cast, similar to this year's Moving. Their performances are amazing! Writing is tight. Cinematography is beautiful and meticulous. For example, watch for an incredible one-shot action sequence reminiscent of Birdman. VFX might not match top Hollywood quality, but there are masterfully choreographed set pieces that keep you on the edge of your seat.For fans of the genre and newcomers alike, this is a series that demands attention.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Let me first say that I enjoyed watching this series. The ideas used were really pure and well arranged. The fourth and last part was very rich and emotional. However, every great work might have a few bugs that stay with the audience until the end.The first contradiction that I could not digest was related to the second part. ""Death"" in the series makes a rule for Yi Jae that if you kill someone, I will intervene. But at the end of the second part, when the character of the killer tries to escape from the truck, several people were actually killed! Why didn't ""death"" intervene there? Why did the bridge escape scenes look like Indian movies?It was pretty hard to arrange the bodies in the fourth episode when Geon Woo's character had an accident. (I understand that it is necessary to do this for the limitation of presenting violent scenes, but it would have been much better to satisfy this limitation!) What if the car hit two characters, and then the car came back, with Ji Soo's character beside the wheel? How? No matter how logically we look at this sequence, the mistake cannot be covered.I won't mention a couple other small things that aren't so unjustifiable. We can't wait for the second season of this series.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I used to love kdramas.. and to be fair, there are still some that are up to standards with intelligent script and mostly with HEART. This latest violent slap stick is certainly NOT that.Death Games is Typical VERY violent crowd pleasing Korea gone USA show. The feelings, when portrayed, are maudlin and heavy laden. Please! How disappointing that subtle, intelligent k-dramas have ended up this way. The ""meaning"" of this show ? Enjoy life while you're living, and love your mama. Couldn't get more basic than that. And if you enjoy a LOT of gratuitous violence, all the better. Pathetic. I feel sorry for the otherwise excellent ML.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"

I was really excited to watch this show asap after seeing the cast of it. With only 4 episodes of it I'm really satisfied with the cast together with their really good performances. Full of thrill that would engage you till the end. The protagonist's life along with deaths and reincarnation series is perfectly weaved and of course Death is as brutal as expected, no mercy! Be it visuals or individual acting or the plot even the ost is engaging. I binge watched it and was so in awe with the talent everyone has. The chasing scenes, the mother son emotion, the lovers emotion, the anger towards death's (character) talks and actions everything is portrayed perfectly. Perfect casting! With astonishing visuals and filming angles all the actors effortlessly catch our attention. Really waiting for the next group of episodes to see how it's going to justify the storyline further. Btw I've read the WEBTOON version also, there're a bit of changes here and there but it doesn't make any big difference and brings it to next level of perfection in drama version. 💯 recommendations!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

Those who haven't read the webtoon are in for a treat-it's one of the best out there. The cast choice is spot-on, and they're doing justice to the webtoon. Even though I've read it, I'm still eagerly awaiting the final four episodes.

On top of that the cinematic effrct was top notch and the script was also well thought out. I'm not sure anything I watch after will fill that ""after a good drama void"" that I now have.

Absolutely amazing. Thus has rekindled my fire for watching Korean shows again and will be looking around to find something similar. I recommend you give this a show ASAP. Can't do justice by explaining so watch it and let everyone know. Best part is thay it's not made by netflix so doesn't have that typical netflix control. Hope they make a season 2 but can't see how. But nevertheless amazing start to end. Wonderful!!!,positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"The show could have delved deeper into the unjust circumstances (having to be a wage slave for all your life) driving people to make life-altering decisions like suicide or crime, while also engaging in compelling debates with death or god, questioning their inconsistency, hypocrisy, and foolishness.The ending was disappointing, especially after the promising direction in episode 6. It seems the show oversimplifies by suggesting one should endure poverty for the sake of loved ones, neglecting the underlying conditions leading to the character's struggles.The resolution of him 'winning' by accepting a life of extreme hardship raises questions about the portrayal of selflessness. The missed opportunity to address the root causes of suicide is regrettable, focusing instead on irrelevant matters.I hate that death's constant expectation from him to accept his fault feels unjust, resembling an unreasonable parent-child dynamic where the parent has high expectations and negative involvement, constantly taunting them for not meeting their unfathomable expectations.The show's metaphor of 'live for those you love' comes off as a flawed and simplistic message, as it considers the unjust system as acceptable.This could have been one of the best shows if it simply recognized or at least even portrayed once how it is actually the system at fault or 'god' for inaction in instances of injustice.",unknown,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"It is the case when not everything that is heart-touching will be useful. IMO, suicide is definitely not a subject for movies, even showing a suicide on a screen does harm.To be honest, actors performing is pretty well, and decorations look real, so the series is rather convincing.There are many ways to show that life is valueable and wonderful, so why choose suicide for that purpose ?And one more question - why so many suffering ? Authors wanted to show us that life is hard but it worth to live anyway? Why so much focus on death, suferrings and suicides ? Why not show us that the world / god loves us, why not highlight that people should assist each other, should appreciate every moment. Not. Only woes, homicides, head-shooting, tears and sufferings.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Wow... is that the first to say the series is Gore ... it hurts the stomach with every death... but the stories slowly get longer ..... (maybe that means more minutes of Mr. @jaeuck.kim )....The actors: you can tell they took care of the transitions between lives and deaths , in fact it took me several minutes to realize it wasn't the same person and that the actor had changed....The story: it reflects the core of the Webtoon, and what is different, is that the characters have a depth and a back story that makes you feel even more moved (I already cried), and hooked and it is that it is very well told.What I've seen today is a strange and very dynamic mix that becomes easy to understand and digest until death comes and it's over sooner than one would wish, you're left with a taste of little and want more and more.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

For a moment, I thought I had downloaded the wrong series. I wasn't initially drawn in by the first episode, but I wanted to continue to see why its rating was so high. Because of that episode, I gave it a rating of 7. I should also add that the main actor didn't perform well at all, and the characters didn't suit them. It's like they didn't even come into character. I hope the next episodes will continue to be this good.Kim Jae-wook has really changed.

tt26225038,"K dramas are usually known for having interesting, eccentric and out of the box plots but very sad to say that this show ( for which i had such high expectations!!!! ) Turned out to be so so so disappointing for the following reasons:
1. Lack of connection in the story. The show seemed to pursue so many different angles of story that it just keeps confusing you as to what is the real plot ?? Is it a murder thriller ? A true self realization plot ? Is it vengeance and romance ? What is it ???2. A predictable story. So called "" Death "" in the show tries to show our protagonist the true consequences of his actions ...throughout the series she keeps hinting towards an answer that he is supposed to reach ...and guess what ..that answer is so bloody obvious. I kept hoping for a "" OMG i never saw that coming"" moment , but i was utterly disappointed in such a low note ending. It does not give you closure at all.3. Just a bad plot. The story could have been so much better with such an amazing cast. There could have been a secret link between the multiple lives or a mysterious reason for the protagonist to go through all that he did. But no. The show kept pursuing several angles with none of the angles having a satisfying end or making sense as to why this subplot is part of the whole thing.UGH I am utterly annoyed after waiting for so long to watch this show with all my fav cast members.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Absolutely amazing.The journey, the cliffhangers, the castings, the acting, everything is top notch. Throughout the show i got to refelect on my own life and thought process. Being someone who herself struggles with such thoughts, i really got some purpose and insight through this show. Every single lifetime beautifully shows how even after having the aspects he was devoid of in his own life, the only thing that could make him content was being who he was and being with his loved ones.

Am not familiar with the webcomic so I have no idea what's coming down the plot chute. First episode was so damn harsh that I almost didn't come back for another round--but the high creative production quality hooked me enough to return for more of the insanity that constitutes many human lives. The acting is excellent across the board. Very interesting contrasts between dark and light visuals tied to states of mind and contexts. The motorcycle ride is wild and crazy and beautiful. A great deal of disturbing human violence both physical and mental is in play. Those with mental health issues might want to stay away as this offers none of the positive outreach 'help' of.

tt26225038,"Due to failure, depression, loss of self-confidence and emotional breakdown, many choose suicide. Suicide is the only solution to survive all kinds of mental turmoil. At that moment no one thinks how difficult and painful life after his death can be. His family does not think about his loved ones. Many say when they are mentally broken - life has become hell. However, if I had known how terrible and painful hell is, I would never have compared hell with life.The main character of the Death's Game series is given the painful punishment of being executed 12 times for committing suicide. He is made to realize the life of family loved ones after his suicide, which he has lost.At the end of 2023, a unique plot, wonderful making, Park Soo Dam's great performance in a dark character, along with the casting of all popular Korean stars.

tt26225038,"So-so kdrama if you're looking for something to bingewatch over the weekend. The star-studded cast of various reincarnations weren't enough to lift the poor storyline and pacing. The cast is the only reason I'm still giving this 6 stars, else it would be lower.The show was adapted from a webtoon that wasn't really popular in the first place. Wasted opportunity since the show's writers could've just made it loosely based on the original story and developed something really new and tight, like ""Weak Hero Class 1"". Instead, we're left with a pathetic main character and his disparate reincarnations. You're expecting well-written interwoven/intertwining stories like ""Crash"" (2004). Instead, the MC just reads about his failed reincarnations in the news.The lack of continuity is jarring. So EVERY episode just ends up pitting a new celebrity actor/reincarnation vs the original weak main character. This goes on and on and diminishes his role further and further until you're actively hating on the main character.I find myself skipping ahead entire segments of the show just to see the MCs next miserable end just because I'm completely disinvested.There's no tension in anything because the main character is written to be an utter imbecile. If you've ever watched Final Destination, you know that impending doom and fear of death causes the cast to constantly be on their toes. Instead, the imbecile MC just goes YOLO swagger all the time, despite the high stakes of falling eternally to hell if he fails. Utterly STUPID.The premise of ANY suicide being a severe punishable sin which ticks off the omnipotent/omnipresent Death god is pretty silly as well. Feels like you're seeing a thinly-veiled Korean religious notions creeping into the show.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"

It changes the genre every 3 episodes. First it has a horror vibe to it.. Then it morphs into an action series....then it changes to sentimental nonsense.The idea is nice and the visuals are also good.. But like I've said, it looses it's track and gets really boring. The last three episodes are that boring, I almost didn't wanted to watch it.

The feels were really there and just when the conversation was getting good death struck. I literally jumped when that car hit them.

Other. Seo In-Guk is always exceptional with any role he plays. Heck I wanted to kill death too in episode 4.I had so many emotions watching episodes 1-4. I am not familiar with the WEBTOON but now I want to read it. It's going to be hard waiting for January 5th for the next 4 episodes. But this drama is worth the wait! Yes, Death is brutal but there are lessons to be learned from Death brutal methods! Please give this drama a watch. It's simply outstanding!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"After having watched the first 4 episodes (which is all that is available atm), I can say that the show is quite unique in its story and has great production value. I really enjoy following the protagonist through his different new lives. I started out not caring too much about the characters. It unfolds as the show progresses - still, the characters don't really grow on me. But part of the beauty of the show is that this doesn't really matter too much as we get snippets of many different characters, which beautifully translate into a bigger picture. So far, I'd say that it isn't a ""deep"" show yet. Some moral clichés get filled to a foreseeable degree, other situations surprise. What I can say for certain is that the show draws me in and is definitely fun to watch so far.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Death's Game is a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre. The storyline, featuring reincarnation and intense moments, is gripping. Despite my usual reservations about fantasy, this series pleasantly surprised me with its real touch, exciting action, and mystique. The ensemble cast, including standout performances by Park So-dam, adds to the brilliance. The visuals are pleasing, and the plot avoids monotony. As a newfound K-drama fan, this show has exceeded my expectations, and I eagerly await a second season. Death's Game is truly superb, offering unpredictability, stellar scripts, and a diverse cast, making it a 10 out of 10 for me. It's a must-watch that stands out in the world of Korean dramas.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"First of all, it's a must watch. Got me crying left and right. It is just so well made that you dont even feel like blinking because you might miss something. It is so exciting and keeps you wanting for more and it delivers exactly what you want. This kind of genre is different in k world but im glad this was made. A huge applause to the whole team and top tier actors.The only complaint i have is the narrative of suicide. The main lead who dies by suicide is made to realize the decision he made was wrong because the people that loved him suffered afterwards. The main lead shouldn't have been made to look like a coward or a bad person just because he decided to end his miserable life.But again, if a suicidal person watching this series decide to seek help from their loved ones, then its the success of the narrative.I loved the dynamic between death and the lead. Also the ending was super satisfying. But there are some cliffhangers. Like what happens to the female lead? Or all the lives he had already lived? Can he interfere or change them? It provokes curiosity. Who knows how the main lead's life change because he now knows too much. He has too much power and knowledge with him. I hope he gets to live his life happily with his mom and start a new family with the female lead, like he have always wanted.At the end of the day, after these dynamic lives that he have lived or the fantasy that he had to go through, the moral is that ""there is only one YOU in this world"". So lets live it even if we fail at times. Lets keep going together<3.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

ep1 wasn't that good (if u compare it with other eps)
but as i had watched the trailer already so i went to the next ep too, after that its just amazing,ep4 cliffhanger is nice too, cant wait for next part (would resist the urge to read its webtoon till then)What I like about the show? It's pretty unpredictable, and from some movie maniac like me, that is saying something.Cast i snice too ( I heard they all top actors/actresses)
the action, drama, cinematography all peak
might be my next fav kdrama (depends on part 2)
i would really recommend watchingC'mon shoot me already.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I loved this series. Everything about it was really well done. The story was really unique and interesting, and when I really thought about it, it kind of reminded me of a Dogs Purpose, but much darker, and a twisted game.I loved the lead, he was perfect in his role, but the actor Kim Jihun, is living in his baddie era, and I'm not mad at it.It was so much fun watching each episode and not knowing who the guest actor would be, so that added an extra element of excitement to the story, but I feel like there was a missed opportunity in the last episode.SPOILER AHEAD FOR LAST EPISODEI would have loved to have seen a final showdown between the Yee-Jae and the antagonist (Tae-u), or at least some final closure. I didn't like that he got the last laugh, literally.Had the final episode not been such a giant bow that nicely wrapped it all up, I would have given the series a 10, which is rare for me to do.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I've watched a few tv shows that were adapted from webtoons before and I'm not saying that they're bad but I've always found something lacking about these tv shows. I think this show in particular has a decent concept but I didn't really like the protagonist. In terms of his characterisation, I think it made sense with how the plot was developing and that the writers wanted to write a more realistic character. Although he thought of the entire thing as a game, it was still kind of weird that he wasn't more traumatised by the numerous violent deaths he experienced. His main objective was to get more money, which yeah. I mean, he died because he didn't have any money so with this rare opportunity given to him, wealth was imperative for him.The way Part 1 ended made me drop the series though. Like why did that Taekang guy suddenly hit Yee-jae and Ji-su with his car? It didn't even seem like he nor his lawyer/driver was drunk. And they were on a sidewalk, not in the middle of the road. The hit and run was so random and it turned me off so much that I couldn't see the point in continuing Part 2 anymore.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"

They even don't think if taking this suicide decision how their parents live, obviously parents always care their children. The content was superb. It's a lesson to those who are taking such decision. Everyone should watch this series last episode was superb, how he struggle for just to fulfill his mother's bucket list. This can't be happened in real life so live your life happily with your parents. All the crew who did effort to making this series success...",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I watched several Korean,Indian and American shows. I liked some,I hated some but with this one it is loved and I will always treasure this experience. The Acting is spectacular. The cinematography is on point. The choreography of action sequences are so unique that will blow your mind. There are some special effects too which doesn't bother me even though you can complain about it but with very limited budget with an extraordinary sound designing ,superb storyline and out of the box direction it is highly unlikely and very clearly cruel to judge the VFX or special effects. I respect,admire and particularly grateful to all of those VFX artists for their hardwork. The soundtrack will not disappoint you although it's not a 90 min soundtrack like other Korean shoes but still it works very well. Now about the screenplay I will say it is something so phenomenal that it will suprise you in every second and you can't predict anything about what will happen next .The twists will blow your mind completely and with each episodes it will exceed your expectations. The director capture the human emotions on whole other level. Now at last I can say that a huge group of talented artists create an art which have unbelievable action scenes,heart teaching emotional scenes and whatever you wish it will fulfill.

He is basically given a chance to live the life of 12 different people who are going to die soon and if he gets to figure out how to survive he ends up getting to continue living his life.The story starts off with him figuring out how to avoid hell and continue living but it soon ends up being a journey of discovering himself and how his decision to take his own life affected others.The cinematography, the acting and most importantly how every story ended with a cliffhanger and how well it was paced is praiseworthy.Death's game has set the bar high for 2024 dramas in Korea and it's not going to be easy to meet it.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

We as audience feel like she deserves more.The show's cinematography and visual effects are also commendable, as they add to the overall suspense and thrill of the show. The cast's performances are also noteworthy, especially Seo In-Guk's portrayal of Choi Yee-Jae, which is both heartfelt and convincing.Overall, Death's Game is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys thrilling and suspenseful dramas.

Of course as given with most Korean Shows acting is superb, from a teenager schoolboy to an adult MMA fighter, they do a good job. Although sometimes I would find some scenes ridiculous and unrealistic (motorcycle chase through the supermarket), which to be fair deals no harm, it's just entertainment.All in all, 8/10 nothing more and nothing less than it deserves.

tt26225038,"One of the best produced K-drama. Hands down. From the acting to cinematography to direction, everything was perfect.Until the end. Like others, I also wanted a happy ending but this wasn't it.Issue 1:
Living as his own mother part is just odd. But it gets weirder when he gets back to his own self in the end, he has the knowledge and abilities from his past death experiences. That's why he was able to ""choose"" not to die again. This invalidates the message of this drama which it was trying so hard to convey. People who are struggling don't and won't have this luxury of knowing how to ""fix"" things.Issue 2:
This one is related to issue 1. But before that I want to say until episode 7 (part2, ep3) the story build up was just amazing. The school boy, prisoner, model, serial killer and detective plot points were beautifully executed. But what was the point. In the end all of this went in vein as now he is back in time and continues to live again as himself at his 13th life. All while knowing that a toddler, school boy and most importantly the love of his life will be murdered very soon (according to death it's inevitable). So what if a serial killer artist is chopping people and a psychopathic rich mf ruining other people's life! Death being so vague didn't felt she knows what she's doing, it felt she's being vague because writers couldn't give her enough reasoning why all the reincarnation centered around Park Tae Woo.Was it all a dream? If so, this drama achieved nothing. If not, these issues should have been clarified, as the entire point of the plots from episode 1-7 is nullified at the end. Perhaps another part after his 13th life could have explained how he changed things for better or worse. But pretty sure it will not happen, so yeah bad ending although its a happy ending.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

This is an excellent, stellar series; so glad I checked it out - my initial reason being Lee Jae Wook, an excellent young actor - but from very beginning this story just kept moving forward and becoming more and more absorbing. As usual, the entire cast, from main actors to supporting actors sprinkled everywhere are all talented professionals and unique in their parts - I have found this in so many of the k-dramas I have watched over last couple years; sometimes you even love the Bad Guy! Learning some unkown things about Korean culture through their productions, there is love and comedy, but the dark side of poverty & despair; rich or poor, expectations of children, the extreme bullying and physical abuse of school children by peers and adults, which also carries over in the workforce, corruption - but redemption.

that's the reason for my rating of 8.As some episodes became too hard to watch.But over all a good series.The end was alright too.Maybe I would have liked another ending better.But this wasn't too bad either.Some episodes were really good like the part where the girl friend is shown - (only too be killed off in such a horrible way)I also liked seeing Lee Jae-wook (my love from Alchemy of souls) - again for him to be killed off :(The cast is huge.

The last body he has been entered many of you can imagine it but just feel it what will you do if you face Ye Jae's condition in your life. That's the most important thing, I think. I can feel the pain, the pleasure, the anger, the vengeance and thus it make this drama a pure masterpiece. I can relate the situation.

It hits with the force of a freight train, and keeps kicking even after the victims are down.

tt26225038,"Death's Game blew my mind. At first, I thought it was like Quantum Leap, where you had to try to find out how the person will die but try to prevent that from happening. But at the same time, it teaches the audience a beautiful lesson that ""life is precious.""First first few episodes were really there to explore Jee-jae's selfishness, how he was someone who couldn't bear living to being swooned by money once given a second change. But he was soon able to become serious once he witness his girlfriend die in front of him. Then the second half is like an elaborate plan to get revenge on the man who wronged her death.That alone makes for a really good plotline; that death has come full circle to watch Mr. Park, the villain, suffer for what he has done. But I think the real beauty in Death's Game is that it symbolizes that life is too precious. To throw it all away through death would not only make you regret taking your life, but it brings great pain to those around you. It really was beautiful, even if the show was seen more of some horror/suspense. Definitely a lot more different than those K-dramas that do tackle these types of issues. At least you got an action-packed sub-story that ties in well with the message it tries to bring to the audience.Definitely watch.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

No words can describe the brilliance of this show, the emotion,fears, remorse,anger, guilt, desperation everything portrayed beautifully.And for anyone who's been through phases of suicidal thoughts, it'll surely help them.I loved this show so much that I made an IMDb account just so I could rate it.Lastly, anyone who is not watching K-dramas has no idea what they're missing out on.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"A cinematic gem that is a must-watch. Worth the time. Amazing cast, incredible acting & great cinematography. This drama intricately merges together a bundle of diverse characters, each portraying unique personalities that delve into a spectrum of emotions. From the harsh realities of unemployment to the child abuse, the film courageously confronts various real-life issues.However, at its core, the drama beautifully conveys a beautiful message: Life is a beautiful journey, worth living, especially for those who cherish and love you. Life itself is a great gift in our life, and treat it like that.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I am in total awe of this mind blowing series. The production values are movie standard. The story is original exciting delightfully entertaining and also profoundly meaningful and touching. Every cast member is perfectly cast to suit the character they are playing. So glad all these top actors took part. The show starts out strong with some movie quality effects. The plane crash and car chase with Jang Seung Jo are done with such high standard. But it's not all excitement. Each episode is different and with just a few quick scenes gets the viewer involved in each character. Some familiar K drama scenarios are so expertly incorporated from school bullying with superb young actor Kim Kang Hoon to prison with Lee Jae Wook. There is terrific black comedy with the baby and sky diving with Sung Hoon. There is one episode with Kim Jae Wook as the artist which is particularly violent but the viewer is in the unique position of rooting for one bad guy over another. The emotional episode with Lee Do Hyun is heartbreaking. Go Yoon Jung is quite the beautiful love interest. Kim Ji Hoon of Flower of Evil fame as the rich villain is totally convincing again, really the best villain actor on TV now. Oh Jung Se again shows his versatility. As does Park So Dam as a kind of grim reaper.Unlike Squid Game this isn't just violence without much meaning. This story is so much better. Really admire the way everything comes together and the viewer is rewarded for paying attention. Not a single wasted scene. I only hope more people will see it. Because it was released on amazon prime not sure that many people will have access to it. There is a very strong anti suicide message here. As the protagonist learns about the pain he caused to those he left behind. So poignant in the light of the late great Lee Sun Kyun. This show is so much better than anything Hollywood has come out with these last years. Kudos to the cast director writer webtoon creator and all involved. This is a series that will leave an impact long after you have finished watching it. So glad this was produced in 2023 when K dramas are getting enough budget to do it justice.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Fascinating story full of lessons of life.Watch it before you die!All of dear staff, thanks a million for making this movie. You are the best.This movie shines as a beacon of excellence. From the opening scene to the closing credits, it weaves a tapestry of storytelling that is both captivating and profound. The characters are not merely players on a screen; they are living, breathing embodiments of human complexity, each with their own dreams, fears, and struggles. Through masterful direction and superb performances, the cast breathes life into these characters, inviting the audience to share in their triumphs and tribulations.Visually stunning, the film transports viewers to worlds both familiar and fantastical, each frame a work of art unto itself. From sweeping vistas to intimate close-ups, every shot is carefully composed, every detail meticulously crafted to evoke emotion and provoke thought. But it is not just the visuals that leave a lasting impact; it is the depth of the storytelling, the layers of meaning that unfold with each viewing.At its core, this movie is a testament to the power of cinema to inspire, to provoke, and to unite. It challenges us to question our assumptions, to confront our biases, and to embrace the beauty of our shared humanity. In a world increasingly divided, it serves as a reminder of the things that bind us together: love, hope, and the enduring power of the human spirit.In short, this movie is not just a film; it is an experience. An experience that transcends the boundaries of time and space, leaving an indelible mark on all who encounter it.

I'm glad I watched it, and I definitely recommend it.For me, the best part was that until the last episode, I was following the main characters thoughts and feelings and it wasn't clear for me what the ""death"" angle wanted from him and asked for.

He struggles to find a job after this and is depressed with the hardships he has been facing, blaming that accident victim. He breaksup with his lover and decides to end his life, considering the death to be just a means to end all his pain. This triggers death and she wants to teach him a lesson by punishing him with 12 lives, where he is re-incarnatated 12 times in the bodies who are about to die. Rules are simple, save the body he is in and live the rest of that person's life. What's in the store for Choi, when he starts reincarnating and whether he will be able to beat death in her own game, forms rest of the story.It took an entire episode to get used to this story and the narrative kept getting better with the second episode onwards. The twists paid off really well and that is solely due to the writing. 8 episodes was perfect for this particular K-Drama as opposed to the usual 16 episodes. The action and visual effects stood put but the characters getting introduced with each episode had a gripping storyline which ensured I was invested with each of these subplots which gets tied up pretty well. Just when I thought, the story is getting relied on beating the protagonist, the episodes 7 and 8 stand out with the twist that got me surprised. The emotional 8th episode truly won me over and though I wished the climax to have ended with the last life, followed by his surrender to death, I wouldn't pick on the climax much as overall, this was an extremely satisfying watch and I strongly recommend this K-Drama to everyone.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"""Death's Game"" is more than a movie; it's a profound journey into the essence of life and the repercussions of suicide. Its narrative resonates with those who've faced the shadow of grief, offering a raw, unfiltered look at the aftermath of loss. Having personally experienced the devastating impact of a close one's suicide, I found solace in the film's authentic portrayal of sorrow and its chain effects. It reminded me of the intricate web of lives interconnected by our actions and the profound consequences of choosing death.The film not only explores the depths of despair but also offers a glimmer of hope, aiding in the healing process for thoughts once consumed by darkness. Through stellar performances and meticulous direction, ""Death's Game"" captures the heavy burden of emotions, making the audience feel the weight of every scene.I'm grateful to the creators for crafting a movie that not only entertains but also heals.

Quite, it's another high-quality korean drama series, if you've seen one or two of them you'll know what it's like, overdramatized moments, with a bunch of good moments, now I would say it's better than most, its format gives the benefit of allowing multiple perspectives and lifes, how people live and their circumstances, there were also a couple of surprises I didn't foresee.But while the journey itself was nice enough, the main character had too many moments that were... dislikeable to me.I'd still recommend this, while it wasn't quite as good for me, the series itself is on a pretty high-standard, and the negatives don't quite detract from how entertaining certain parts were.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"This series is so unusual that it is always interesting and sometimes surprising. It also manages to find a degree of emotional resonance through the inter-relationships of the characters visited by Death, or rather by the person she is punishing.Some of the early characters are vehicles for action rather than emotional resonance, which is fine. But as the series progresses its focus shifts and each life builds upon the previous ones in a way that sucks you into wanting to know what will happen in subsequent episodes.I am sorry that my comments are so ambiguous, but I am keen not to say anything to spoil the surprises this series delivers along the way.

tt26225038,"WEBTOON's original story makes more sense, this drama doesn't make sense, there is something wrong, I know he is desperate and was thrown out of his rented house, if I were in his position I would do the same thing, if there was no one I knew who cared about me, would I have to beg to survive? It's still in vain. And the question is why didn't he stay at his mother's house first, he still has a mother who loves him and he would rather die. Secondly, how long has he been dating jisu, why doesn't he know that jisu has an older brother? Even if this scene were changed and Jisu was really cheating, it would definitely be painful, because I know what it's like to break up in love, that alone is hard, let alone the life problems that befall you.I also don't understand the plot where Park Taekang's plane suddenly has a bomb and explodes. Who planted the bomb? And why?When I see people committing suicide I feel like I'm not alone and I want to do it, but I'm a coward, I'm too afraid of death, now I just pray so I can die quickly without committing suicide even though it's painful and tiringThis film is quite motivating for me, being in Yijae mom's position is not easy, her life is surrounded by sadness and loneliness, but she never gave up, she's very strong.For this film, I like the visual character, Yijae's mother looks young and old with the same face, the editor and make-up artist are very professional.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

Has zero expectations as my trust in ""high scores"" had been quite shaken.This one was totally worth it though. Original concept (for me at least), excellent production quality, great actors. No open mouth chewing haha, and no ""plot fillers"" to stretch the series to the usual 16 episodes. I really liked that they skipped multiple sub-plot lines and chose not to create endless flashbacks like some other series.The plot moves along fast, I literally binged the series in a couple of days. Made me think, too.My only gripe is that the last episode is kind of slow and some emotional scenes are a little too melodramatic (had to hast forward all the soggy speeches).

I wrote my earlier review after watching the second episode, and am editing now after watching the last episode.
I am in tears and the joy I am feeling right now is heart warming. This drama was so beautiful and fabulous... I have no words.
The story line is so good, you will be in tears and you will think again about K dramas, its that beautiful. Every character development is smooth, and its not complete 360 change which usually is shown. Its just becoming better. The costumes, music, scenes, dialogues, actors, editing, production... everything is so perfect I-... Its just awesome.
This show didn't disappoint me even for single second. The last episode is so beautifully, you will be crying that it ended and be happy about the ending the characters got.
And Boy did the actors act?! Kim Soo Hyun is famous I get it, but Oh Jung Se?!! Major shout out to him and Yoo Sae Ji!! these two acted so good that I got moved for real. I have seen Oh Jung Se acting as support actor in so many dramas, but this? This is how a good actor makes a supporting character into a Lead character. Its brilliant. New respect for both Oh Jung Se and Yoo Sae Ji.
This show is a must for everyone who thinks they are 'Not Okay'. This show will show you that being 'Not Okay' is 'okay'. You can have flaws too, and you will see that everyone has them too. You will see that being not okay is what makes you human.OLD REVIEW-
I have watched many k dramas, and this is very different.
Maybe because it's a Netflix original, but it has the touch of more than just k-drama. Whole production idea is different, including the story book display. Great concept. It's not the flowery, lovey dovey k drama fairy tale. It's a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes k drama's concept of childhood friends meeting again and dark deep dialogues. To say it's playlist is good, would be an understatement. Just two episodes and I am already in love with it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes.

tt12451520,"Okay, so let me start by saying I loved the whole concept of this show. The slightly ""other-worldly"" feel of it makes this show feel very different from anything I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, from Soo-Hyun's heartbreaking performance, to Ye-Ji's feisty, sadistic-but-fun anti-heroine, to Jeong-Se's unreal acting as an autistic man that is on par with Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. The music is lovely, and the slow-build romance between Moon-Young and Gang-Tae is so wonderful to watch.Now for the flaw - the ""villain."" I absolutely HATED the whole plot-line of Moon-Young's evil mother. It would have been fine if she had remained dead and was just this haunting, painful roadblock for Moon-Young to get over. But instead she somehow survived a fatal fall down a staircase and being thrown into a lake by her husband? And no, this miraculous survival was never explained. Also her face completely changed, and apparently she just got plastic surgery to change her appearance, but somehow no one knew about this? Don't forget she is supposed to be an incredibly famous and popular author. And she was perfect at faking being a really nice and wonderful nurse at the psychiatric hospital that her husband just so happened to be admitted to - how did she even get the job? She just had a fake name and resume? Did no one ever check up on this woman? Honestly it was so dumb and unrealistic, and when she finally showed her ""true colors,"" she was just so over the top ""evil"" that it was laughable and totally ruined the whole mood.The show was saved by the performances of our main characters, but I'm glad they left the reveal of the mother till almost the very end, otherwise I might have stopped watching altogether. I think its worth a watch for the good reasons mentioned above, but the mother story line is something you will have to just ignore.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"Let me start by saying this is an excellent acted psychological drama/love story, with the main protagonists scarred by events or situations they have been in during their life. The main setting is a psychiatric hospital & I will not go into the main storyline details b/c that can be read in a synopsis.I wanted to give this drama an 8 or 9/10, but there is one RIDICULOUS plot twist that I cannot forgive so I've only given it a 6/10.*****SPOILER ALERT******Okay, let us talk about the mom of the daughter still being alive. It really goes off the rails on this ""twist"" in Episode 14. In Episode 13, the mom was shown explicitly being thrown off a 2nd story balcony by her husband & directly landing on the side of her head on the below stairwell. She suffered SEVERE hemorrhaging that would have killed her; but let's say for ""creative license"" sakes she survived this event. She would have had a SEVERE traumatic brain injury & would be eating through a straw the rest of her life! But there is more. Her husband then throws her body that's inside a bag into a cold lake. So basically, she's now dead X 2.But nope, she's been alive the last 20 yrs. & is now the head nurse at the psychiatric hospital! Say what?? It's explained that she looks nothing like her younger version b/c of plastic surgery; and by looking at the difference b/t the 2 mom actors, extensive/multiple plastic surgeries! I don't know how she found time to go to nursing school.If that isn't enough bad writing, it's shows the mom/head nurse helping a patient kill himself that occurs in Episode 1. But there are surveillance cameras in his room. A detective with more than 1 brain cell could look at the surveillance camera to show her helping him commit suicide! But that would have been the end of this drama after 1 episode.To me, this type of writing is an insult to the viewer. I understand in many dramas you must suspend belief to a point. But this ""suspension"" is Friday the 13th Jason type-suspension. And this is not a Friday the 13th type drama. Overall, it is a beautifully written drama showing how 2 scarred individuals fall in love while one grows a soul & the other finds life beyond helping others.My recommendation is to watch this drama but have your favorite hard liquor of choice available in Episode 14..........it might make the ridiculous plot twist go down better.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The scene that stand out for me are when Sang-tae cries out that his older brother wants to kill him in the hospital in front of the mural. A tear slides down Ko's cheek.The songs in this drama are VERY good! I must add to my Spotify!I feel I am more understanding in mental health after watching this drama. The drama shows various patients with a variety of mental health issues including PTSD, trauma, childhood abuse, autism, etc.Moon Gang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong's kiss scenes were really, really hot. This drama mentioned sexualities, condoms and even showed the two of them assumedly naked under the covers holding on to each other.Ko's fashion style - I love her designer clothes and gothic kind of style.

tt12451520,"I love Kim Soo Hyun, let's get that out of the way first. He's the reason why I watched this show. He's a remarkable and versatile actor and devastatingly handsome. I've followed his career since Dream High and loved every one of his dramas...except this. I can see the premise of the show, and it was actually promising at the beginning. As someone who suffers from mental health issues, I could relate with that aspect of the show, although as one of the reviewers mentioned, it glamourized mental illness...that part of it I didn't like. I do appreciate the healing side of the show and how the characters eventually experience growth and transformation. I also liked how they related every episode to a fairy tale. The concept was there, the execution, not so much. Sometimes the acting was too cheesy. I even felt KSH hammed it up in certain scenes. I liked the Sang-tae actor, he deserves an award for his portrayal. I also liked the secondary characters like Juri, Jae-Soo, and Manager Lee. KSH and Seo Ye-ji did have chemistry off screen (I watched BTS too many times to know), but I personally felt something was missing from their on screen chemistry. The plot was predictable-I already knew, for instance, in episode 2 or 3 who her mother was-and the script was pretty basic. It didn't give me anything new or something to ruminate on. It was literally just a CW show with Korean actors, and one of the reviewers on here actually mentioned how the appeal of kdramas is that they are for the most part more chaste...this was pretty daring, I must say. Very Hollywood, indeed...and I guess that's the effect of kdramas becoming more internationally known, and with the Netflix crossover, one can definitely feel the Western influences on the show (e.g. music soundtrack which I felt didn't match the show's mood). There were many ship-worthy scenes, which I would like to go back to, but the beauty of Gang-tae and Moon-young's relationship was ""the chase"". Once it got to ep. 15 and 16, where the two become an item and do their business, it lost its appeal for me. It seems like the show knew what the audience wanted and gave it regardless of whether the quality was good or not. Some scenes could have been done differently or left to the imagination, but I'm obviously the minority on this. Then the villain which **spoiler alert** the show built up to be this super evil and scary witch-once she makes her reveal, she's eliminated in the same episode like a pesky fly lol a little anti-climatic. I laughed because she waited, what was it, 25 years? To have her revenge. It would have been better if she just tormented her daughter from afar. She got caught by the police so easily and wasn't much of a threat. Finally, never in real life would I buy a book by Moon-Young for a child lol what crazy parent would? And ep.16 was unnecessarily long...even felt longer than the Lord of the Rings 3's ending.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This show gives its audience what we expect from a classic yet different drama. The transaction from one scene to another is so smooth that you don't realise the effect as anything dramatic. The emotions of loneliness Sadness Happiness Jealousy Love are so amazingly portrayed that you feel like this is no big deal but will let you understand human nature.

tt12451520,""" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"The series offers an interesting story set in the format of a fairy tale. Fairy tales only end well, but are cruel overall (therefore, many modern generation parents even refuse to read classical fairy tales to their children). So the film reflects this element and the atmosphere well. The story is a slow churn, but interest and a certain level of suspense are maintained. Overacting by the female lead, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft (from Harry Potter) style mansion setting and over the top clothing of the female lead to me personally were annoying elements which distracted from the story, although they did play a role in depicting the fairy tale element and character development. Very realistic depiction of the character of the brother by Oh Jeong-Se. Well thought out titles of the episodes.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This drama's high rating is absurd. Viewers were continuously exhorted on fan sites to rate this show 10/10, never mind the forced acting, the dragging pace and the appalling lack of originality of the series. Fans have even been shamelessly trying to grab the ""most-watched Netflix series in 2020"" crown, based on inaccurate statistics in a site not affiliated with Netflix that tended to give dramas shown later in 2020 higher points than those shown earlier. Official Netflix reports have given that crown to other kdramas.The idea of fairy-tale themed episodes is merely a copy of ABC's Once Upon A Time TV series. The storyline where the leads turned out to know each other in the past is so overused in kdramas I could not help but roll my eyes when it also came up in this fan service. Excusing a person's rotten behavior because of things that happened in her past is a rotten cliche. There are countless brave and strong people who have survived much worse trauma than what the spoiled annoying female lead went through without becoming witches. But hey, dress her up in gorgeous clothes and serve up more sex and fans would go gaga. Just turn a blind eye to the harassment the male lead suffered from the female lead. Had the genders been reversed and it was a female being harassed by a predatory male, the outrage would been deafening. But no, the harasser is dressed in designer clothes and you have to understand, she is sick having been through a rough childhood, so let her be. In fact, shower this drama with awards. Sicko predators out there could take a pointer from this drama on how to get away with bad behavior. (sarcasm alert)Another proof of the ridiculous adulation this drama got - other kdramas are slammed for product placements, yet, the signature clothes blatantly and glaringly worn by the female lead even garnered awards!To fans of performers, please rate responsibly, not blindly giving top marks just to put your idol's show up some lists or to influence awards committees. This has already discouraged people I know from watching more kdramas, wary all kdramas are as bad as this or even worse, since this has such a high rating. Rhapsodizing this as a family show is really going overboard unless you wish to raise wannabe predators. But they would all get cured in the end, right? So, rhapsodize away. (sarcasm alert 2).",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"So many things about this series are exceptionally good. The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist.
Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Much better than The King Eternal Monarch where there was little chemistry between Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun.
Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching.
The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. For all those who have been disappointed by unsatisfying endings in K dramas this one helps to makes up for some of them.

Yes she had a hard and toxic childhood, but that does not give permission to be cruel and spiteful as and when it suits her. I could have been won round had the scriptwriters not included a scene where she tears the butterfly's in half, but after seeing that scene, I just could not see her in any other light but cruel. As others have said there are many who have had a tough childhood and a turbulent relationship with her parents, but they grow up to be compassionate people regardless of their issues. If you dig deep enough you can always find reasons for even the most ruthless person, but that does not make it OK. As for being a famous children's book author - what parent would allow their children to read such dark storiesThere are some light and humorous moments, the autistic brother and the Director of the psychiatric ward are fantastic, but at times I found it very slow. I am at episode 8 and struggling to keep going.

tt12451520,"It's Okay to Not Be Okay is a K-drama exploring the challenges of childhood trauma, the difficulties of mental illness, and the potential for love and familial belonging as healing mechanisms. The male lead is the caregiver Moon Gang-tae who looks after his autistic elder brother Moon Sang-tae, while the female lead is the fairy tale author Ko Moon-young. United by a tragedy early in their lives and dealing with their individual demons from the past, their re-acquaintance and growing attachment to each other enables them to face and overcome their suppressed fears.Artistically, It's Okay to Not Be Okay is phenomenal. The set design, the costuming, the cinematography, the animations, the soundtrack ... they are all incredible. The story's use of dark fairy tales to convey lessons is creative and the psychiatric hospital as a setting enables the spreading of awareness regarding different mental health disorders. The acting of the cast is also excellent; Oh Jung-Se is the highlight in his role as Moon Sang-tae but the lead couple's chemistry is also evident.Unfortunately, the show also has some serious flaws and failures. It falls into the trap of romanticising abusive relationships and does not propose good ways to manage mental health issues. Moon-young's manipulative nature and stalking behaviour in the initial episodes almost seem to be excused instead of maturely addressed. Therapy is barely featured, with practical solutions circumvented in favour of unrealistic ""love heals all"" and ""destined connection"" tropes. The inclusion of the one-note evil dead-but-not-actually-dead mother who also orphaned the brothers and was somehow hiding for years as a nurse ... that entire plotline only serves to diminish the coherence and emotional impact of the story. Finally, secondary characters like Jae-soo, Ju-ri and Lee Sang-in are lacking in their development and have unsatisfying story arcs.In conclusion, It's Okay to Not Be Okay excels in its aesthetic qualities and has some strong themes and poignant scenes. The show however disappoints in its overarching plot and lacks nuance in its depiction of mental health. It can still make for an enjoyable watch to lovers of well-produced K-dramas, especially those who favour tear-jerking romances.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""This line from ""Rocky Balboa"" seemed to ring loudly in my mind as this series concluded for me. Indeed, no one goes through life unscathed, and some take even greater lumps than most. However, no matter what we've suffered, it's perseverance that matters most. Not giving up. Always push on.To my mind, K-dramas are dominating the television airwaves. While I have watched a few bad ones, most have been anywhere from great to superb. ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" certainly fits the ""superb"" bill for me.As several reviewers have already mentioned, this is a very unique series that deals with the mental and emotional suffering that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. Perhaps that is what makes the series so relatable as well as profound with the central question: when do people finally acquire the courage to take responsibility for their own lives?For so many people in this world, we blame our parents for our misfortunes and our sufferings. Why didn't they love us more? Why did they mistreat us? Where was that unconditional love we were supposed to be showered with?Unfortunately, the answers we tell ourselves are filled with as many lies as the questions we come up with. Perhaps we weren't worthy of that love. Perhaps we simply weren't good enough. No matter what answers we contrive in an attempt to ""makes sense of it all"" we, too often, play the victim.Gang-Tae is a caregiver at a local mental hospital. His body is riddled with scars given to him by patients who have lashed out at him. However, his physical scars pale in comparison to his emotional ones. In short, he truly believes he is not worth loving.Sang-Tae is Gang-Tae's older brother with fairly severe autism. He suffers from a moment in the past when he was present for his mother's murder. The murderer threatens to kill him should he ever tell anyone about it. So scarred by the event, Gang-Tae placates his brother by making sure to move every autumn of every year. He somehow wants to be free of his burden.Ko-Muen Young is a woman who was touted as a princess by her mother; someone who is head-and-shoulders above everyone else. And people should be treated with disdain and contempt for being so beneath her. This is a woman who has no idea how to interact with people. She had no filter, and therefore, speaks her mind and her feelings, both good and bad. She is a little girl desperately wanting someone to love her.The irony is that all three characters, in some way, shape or form, represent some of the most common fears and desires of every single person on this planet: to be worthy of love, to be relieved of our fears and burdens, and to simply be loved for who we are.The series masterfully navigates how all three characters are able to find peace with themselves, and perhaps, even some joy culminating in a last episode that will have you smiling and crying at the same time.Yes, it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to fall. It is okay to be knocked down. It is not okay to give up and stay down. Everyone must find the courage to get up and keep going. That is the series' central message.The performances in this series are top-notch all the way around. However, accolades must truly be given to Jeong-Se Oh (Sang-tae) who turns in a performance that easily rivals Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" In fact, to my mind, Jeong-Se Oh's performance surpasses it. He is truly deserving of any awards he might acquire for one of the best acting performances seen in a long time.This series has almost everything: a mystery, laugh-out-loud moments, heartfelt moments, cringeworthy moments, and plenty of relatable moments, depending on who you are.I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It should almost be required viewing. For perhaps, you might find some ""healing moments"" of your own as you watch this show, and be presented with the question: will you blame others for your problems? Or will you find the courage to begin living your own life?",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Seo Ye-ji has a slightly annoying yet bearable because of her stunning appearance character.

It's like a void that will never be filled, in the most beautiful way possible. I love it so much and I really hope they somehow renew this for another season, although unlikely. The chemistry between the actors kills me, each scene they're together hurts me even if it's a happy one. I loved the magical realism and the little details they put into the plot, which just further enhanced the great acting of all the actors. If you're planning to watch this, I recommend preparing yourself 'cause you're gonna feel empty for a while after finishing it. Try to not miss anything and dedicate your full attention when watching it - that's how you'll enjoy it the most. I don't think I have ever shipped a couple so much, the dynamics and their backstories and the way they healed through each other are just perfect. The tension and the stares during those sweet and intimate scenes are what really pushed me off the edge. And of course, the funniest faces and lines at the most unexpected moments. I am 100% sure that this will probably be my favorite k-drama forever, I got so lost in their world and I find myself going back to it every now and then. I find comfort in them and I've gotten so used to it all. The familiarity you'll develop with the show is the best part of everything.

The chemistry between Kim SooHyun vs Seo Yeji vs Oh JungSe is beyond anything I've seen on any Kdramas. KSH & SYJ are beautiful and are just mesmerising to watch. It is refreshing how each episode is a life lesson and has an underlying fairy tale theme which is inter-wovened into the plot and the character's development. Each ep gets better and better. Counting days when the weekend would come, so I can strap myself and engross in the show. This show will make you laugh and cry, laugh cry within minutes. Thank you production team for this drama and for casting such stellar casts. It is truly a healing drama for me.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This tv show does not generalize, sensationalize or glorify mental health issues. They show that every person despite their appearance may have something they're working through. The main characters have insane chemistry (brother to brother, friend to friend, lover to lover) which makes the story even more believable and the scenes more enjoyable. I have never seen a tv show like this before and I absolutely love it!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This is only the second k-drama that I am watching.before this drama,I only watched my love from the star which blew my mind and instantly made me fall in love with Kim Soo hyun and k-drama.Then I searched to only find that most of the Korean dramas are like this same genre.so I was searching for something new and when I start watching this drama, I find that it is something new addition to Korean dramas..not that typical rom-coms.its a unique and emotional journey of love and relationship.this realistic portrait of relationship made me fall in love with this drama",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"I almost skipped on watching this title because originally I thought it was made by Netflix, I am really glad I watched it. It's an amazing KDrama and one of a kind acting from all the actors. A roller coaster of feelings. It has its cheesy moments but still a 10 in my book, it kept things entertaining from start to the end.Fortunately Netflix was not involved in the making of this show, because lately they ruin everything they touch. Luckily they just stream it on their platform so its not a cheap PC production like the usual Netflix stuff.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"As a psychologist and critic, I say do not miss this wonderful series in any way. Everything in this series from screenwriting, directing, acting, editing, costume design and so on It is amazing. All the actors played amazingly well, both with their eyes and with their limbs. Everyone's characterization was so great, including all the sub-roles, That you understood all their morals and behavior. The look and character of each one was full of words that you fully understood. This series was so great in the field of psychology. As a psychologist, I was amazed that they were able to master the details of the human soulShow that I really have to admit I have never seen it so accurate anywhere. You have to watch this series many times and very deeplyTo understand how much the series has small points and thoughtful dialogues. Add to that the soundtrack and soothing songs of the series. It is a masterpiece. About directing and editing and designing costumes that. Which is indescribable at all, you will realize that it is absolutely amazing with one episode. In my opinion, the score of the series should be even higher. Imdb , Raise the score of the series.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This has got to be the most overrated kdrama ever. It's okay but definitely not better than other kdramas that have lower ratings like Crash Landing On You, Descendants of the Sun and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin). It glamorizes mental illness, condones sexual harassment, has hammed acting and an unbelievable storyline for a villain.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"Actually I am not a fan of either the main actor or actress. I am a typical person who chooses to watch a drama because of the cast, while watching this drama my desire is actually just to fill my free time, not to wait for the comeback of the actor or actress. It could be called just an accident, but dang! even from the first episode I was very much in love with this drama, the main actors were equally very strong, their wives were very good, the storyline was not common and boring, it tells about someone's mental state, they have a good moral message. To be honest, since I became acquainted with the world of Korean drama, this drama has been included in the best drama of all time, in my own opinion. Look at this drama, I guarantee you will not be disappointed",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This is a series for 12+ of age. It's mostly a series written for children. Very childish. I wish some Korean series drama/romance are for the older target groups. It wasn't bad, but the series consists of 16 episodes. I only found it most interesting when something major happened and that was towards the ending of the series. It's a very soft storyline, nothing really exciting. All I was thinking during the first 6 episodes, okay a big spoilt woman with problems is harassing the man with words. The man is also having problems and you have to wait like 10 episodes until something romantic happens. Before this it's only staring eyes and some soft/romantic music while they stare in each others eyes. If you have plenty enough time and like slow and soft series you can watch this. If you are an adult and also like more adult series and a little bit faster paced series don't watch this. It will bore you.",,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"The acting, the script, the whole thing is high school level stuff. Actors who think pausing in a sentence is acting. However, Oh Jeong-Se, acting as an autistic adult, is amazing throughout the series. Truly great. I think he should be considered for an Emmy. What a role and what an actor. The rest, the acting, the script, the whole thing, is just so-so. If they cut out all the long scenes where people stare at either each other or off into the distance, the series could have been shortened by half. Still, Oh Jeong-Se is worth the price of admission.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"The intro is good, but I didn't find the first episode interesting as a whole. The camera shots were awesome as well as the transitions. What I like about the series is the way the female lead expresses her thoughts implicitly. The children stories laid out for each episode also contributed in making this series better. This drama also let you see the two sides of a story as well as the characters. All characters are flawed and made beautifully. A suggestion for improvement is to lessen the dull moments and fill each episode with more happenings. It was ended well though, I really like it. The female lead is also funny especially in episode 9.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This is such a great show!! It got me obsessed within the first two episodes. The main characters are both so good at portraying their emotions! I LOVE that the character of the main actress is so different to other main characters to diverse K-Dramas. Ok so let me explain. In most Dramas its always this quirky, shy, innocent girl that has no idea about life or whatever and that always needs the help of a man to achieve something. In its okay to not be okay though, the female character is strong and independent. She has more like this personality where she knows from the beginning what she wants and tries to get it by whatever means. And can we just take a minute and appreciate how visually pleasing the main actors are like omg they are GOREGOUS !!!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"I don't get the hype really. I watched 4 episodes so far. For me I wouldn't mind if the leads were just annoying. but glorifying these annoying behaviours, I can't accept it. FL with Antisocial personality syndrome, a dark past, Different from the usual fairy tale nature of the romantic dramas. This would have made a great plot. but they focussed on the dark side of it. For eg, The assembly man's son ran away with the FL and caused a big scene at the election campaign. They showed that as FL done a good thing. I get that his father is not a good person. but what she did was not the right thing. Also Violent portrayal of scenes in a children's storybook. FL leads says it has deeper meaning to it than what is shown on the outside. But how children are supposed to understand that. But that would have been okay because the character can't really understand peoples or emotions. But the writers chose to glorify that. It is okay to not be okay. But it is not okay glorify the factors that makes them not okay.
I am gonna watch the show anyway. will update this then.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"I don't usually comment or talk about something I watched, but this is a very highly recommended series. I haven't watched something that is very well made like this in a veryyyyy long time. And, honestly it is now one of my very favourite things to watch.I was kind of worried at the beginning because it seemed a bit different than what I usually watch since I started watching K-Dramas; however it came out to be exactly what I needed to watch.Whether you are into K-Drama or not, this is something you really don't want to miss.. It discuses a whole lot of issues and topics. Especially, for those who are suffering from mental issues. I am in love with it 💯.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"Just so you know, I can't remember the characters names well so I'll be using other names that are not of the charactersThe cinematography in this drama is very good. Even by just the cover you can just see how well it's shot and gives the overall vibe of this drama. Many of the scenes were shot well to capture the severity of the situation. And the use of cartoons was well executed to explain the overall theme of the episode. For example they can say repunzel, and throughout the episode they might explain how ko moonyoung(FL) was trapped by her mother in the castle with long hair, waiting for her prince charming to save her. So each episode has its own theme relating to classic fairy talesThe three main characters' acting it immaculate. Ko moon young was this antisocial woman, who did not care about anyone but herself, has a dark aura to her and seems like an empty shell on the outside. She is so different from other FL as she is very blunt with her emotions and what she wants. She makes the moves in her relationship with the moon gangtae(ML). She has showed the most growth in her character with is very nice to see as the story develops.Moon gangtae is a younger brother that takes care of his autistic brother. He is a caregiver and has no parents as his mother was murdered. His life revolves around his older brother and has never had anything to himself. He always felt as if his life purpose was to take care of his brother and nothing else and felt neglected by his mother. In this drama, he will become a great support system for the FL and also heal his inner child in him and find purpose in life besides his brotherMoon sangtae is the older brother to the ML and is autistic. He is the only witness to his mother's murderer. Becouse of his mental disability, he was unable to express what he saw and only said butterfly as it was the only key thing he saw at the time. Becouse of this butterfly that promised to kill him if he tells anyone, him and his brother had to travel town to town whenever spring came. The acting of this character so great that I can nolonger see this person not being autistic. His disability makes him lack emotional intelligence but as the story progresses, he grew to be more emotional and cautious to people around him. He was always dependent on his younger sibling but he grew to be independent and more like an adult.None of the characters in this story felt useless. I loved the stories of patients becouse all of them came for different reasons but they all really needed to be loved.This story taught me alot about trauma. It shows we are all adults who still want to be loved and love like children. Each of our wounds are different and will heal differently at a different pace. No matter how you get there, all that matters is you are happy with your lifeThe ending could've been any better. Just soo good. This is my all time favourite kdrama.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It shows so much compassion with its difficult self-sabotaging characters and has such a patient and motherly way of holding them in tension with each other just long enough to give them- finally- the chance to find eachother....it shows how much we all need the loyalty of others to hold us long enough untill we find the strenght to be brave again. To risk getting hurt again and to hold on the a new hope of deserving love....trauma frezzes us inside and its impossible to warm yourself up again all alone. This series shows how we can find healing if we let other people in, slowly, very slowly....

The storyline, the acting, perfect casting, the location, even the in story fairy tale books/stories were brilliant!!! Just brilliant. I am just blown away. And for someone who loves korean horror/zombie shows (i.e. kingdom, train to busan, etc) - that is a big thing. I am absolutely amazed by the three main leads. The supporting cast are also top notch. Its the most well cast production Ive seen so far.
This is a k-drama that I can definitely recommend. It is a brave show that tackles mental illnesses and I am so very proud how this has been done thru this show. Good on you for doing this. We need more of these shows!
I wonder if those fairy tale books are actually real books? If not, then they should be. Loved the storylines there too! and the artworks!! Love it.
And last but not the least - the female lead's outfits! OMG - just for her outfits I would watch the whole show! I dont know who she is but she carries them so well, i love her acting and i love her voice!!!! Hope to see more of you in the very near future!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The much vaunted ""path of recovery"" that should be noted throughout the series is interspersed with completely superficial events that have nothing to do with the plot and in some cases do not even affect the characters themselves. It's as if the characters have changes in completely random phases, due to events that never happened or simply because someone told them a single thing. This dynamic occurs predominantly between the two protagonists. The final part in which they had to force the mother out with a ruse that was childish and not very credible to say the least disappointed me to say the least. There are ideas in this series and they are all very interesting, too bad the realization is not the top.

You must be strong to watch this and even I cannot binge it.

tt12451520,"People can dislike my comments all they want but I will still go ahead and say it. This show was the worst kdrama I've landed my eyes on, for a couple of reasons. As a mental health advocate and psychology graduate I worry people take this show seriously. The way they portrait the female character as doing all these very despicable acts and portraying it like a badass character normalizes mental illness. There is no real message of psychology or self care. The mental illnesses showed were not very realistic and very stereotypical. The girl gets away with doing everything because she has ""trauma"" or she's just too badass. I also don't think it's okay that they portrait her as someone that can do whatever she wants around the main guy and gets away with it.The couple has no chemistry at all and the guy has zero personality nor he stands for himself and everything she does to him. This the perfect example of RUN AWAY from a relationship as it is a very toxic one. The only thing I learned about him was that he really cares for his brother, and that was it.Besides the cinematography this show was a huge disappointment and I don't recommend it.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

While this is very important for everyone's psychological health. This theme is beautifully depicted in this series.

Just like twenty five twenty one drama.. Sparkling Watermellon will make you recall your first love which could either be a heartwarming or a heartbreaking experience. Nonetheless, you'll feel nostalgic for the past and its simple joys!The show is still ongoing as I write this review, I'm on episode 9 and I still don't get its title?!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"This Korean drama is at turns delightfully light and emotional. The music is superb. The actors are adorable. There are elements of coming-of-age, rom-com, and fantasy time travel. But, foremost, it embodies a celebration of life -- especially of aspects that are sweet and sparkly like the title, Twinkling Watermelon.The emotional core involves the enduring dilemma faced by young people: whether to live a life that makes their heart beat or follow the lead of their parents. The main character Ha Eun-gyeol, a CODA (child of deaf adult) youth, grapples between following his passions and serving the needs of his family, when he is presented with an opportunity to change the trajectory of their lives by slipping back in time when his parents were his age. We're also presented with the question, would life really be better if the past changed to our liking?As the story transpires, we see some of the joys and sparks of youth, its conflicts and uncertainties. It delves into teenage anxiety and mental health issues and the pressures from parents and society. The show also portrays beautiful friendships and loving, albeit sometimes misunderstood, family relationships. The deaf character portrayed by Shin Eun-soo is a gem. And Choi Hyun-wook is a master at capturing the spirit and zest of youth.In a way, the show follows some of the winning formulae of other recent successes. As in the movie CODA, it peers into the lives of the deaf who face many challenges but lead meaningful lives. As in Someday or One Day, it makes you dream about rewriting the past, preventing accidents, and letting go of guilt and resentment. As in 2521 and the Reply series, it taps into 90s nostalgia, when times were simpler, when you had to run to a pay phone to answer urgent beeper messages and could drop by your friend's home anytime. So, in a way, it is not groundbreaking but a good story nonetheless.If splitting hairs, the series is not without imperfections. Time travel presents logic problems. It's apparent from the proficiency of signing that the actors are not deaf themselves. And there is a reliance on common tropes to create obstacles for the characters. But I recommend you watch this for its emotional journey and uplifting message.The main character's parents are deaf, but they are 'cheerful, healthy, and happy because they could communicate with their eyes, their hearts, and their hands.' We all have problems, but we can also grow, adapt, and have fun. The show promotes embracing music and loved ones: Seize the day, its joys and opportunities! ¡Viva la vida!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

It was such a heartwarming drama and it has definitely got the spot in my top dramas list.

The girl doesn't deserve the guy at all. Thankfully twinkling Watermelon is nothing like that. The characters in this show are given a real indepth back ground and helps you to understand them better. You can see the real emotions in the characters and their journey of highs and lows we see them in their growth. This story will make you laugh, cry and dance.

Then it's beautifully romantic and you will love the bond and loyalty of all of their friendships.And the most special part is of course the value of family and how our male lead is doing everything he can to make his loved ones change their fate to be the happiest they can be.There's so many complex subjects and subplots as well, but it works so well. Story is well paced and the twists are great and not predictable. The characters are well written and rich in layers and development.Honestly, the writers of this drama deserve recognition for this work.The chemistry amongst the cast is fantastic in general but the main pair and their bromance ( or better said father and son) is unbeatable. I had moments where I was honestly crying of laughter.I have been following Choi Hyun Wook and his impressive acting for a while ( specially in Weak Hero Class), and it's just very unbelievable to me that he is only 21. I can't wait to see more of him.But I do have to make a special mention of Ryeoun, the display of emotions he shows playing this character is amazing, he made me cry a few times and his eyes were just pure emotion the whole time.

I really liked the complicated dynamic of hearing and hearing impaired. Most importantly how they actually used sign language. The main actors fit their role and acted it out sparkling. The story was well written and I can't really come up with something bad about it. Some of the main plot is something we seen plenty of times before, but made in a way I didnt mind that at all.

tt27446493,"TWINKLING WATERMELON is one of the best Kdramas of all time in every aspect. Well, this is my first time writing a review!! I've come across many beautiful dramas but this drama has my whole heart because it was so comforting. The way this drama portrayed each character and their emotions was just mind-blowing. From start to end, it got me on the edge of my seat, and the character development was just WOW. You will feel like you're a part of the drama where you giggle wholeheartedly, weep like a child, and feel sad and happy with every moment. I felt a mixture of emotions while watching this show but it felt comfortable, soothing, and warm inside. Kudos to the cast and crew for coming up with this beautiful drama. The screenplay and the narration of the story were just fantastic. Ryeoun (Eun-gyeol) carried the whole show to the next level with his natural and nuanced acting. He was soo cute in every way. I enjoyed Ryeon and Choi Hyun-Wook's screen time. This father-son chaotic duo made every episode funny and beautiful with their versatile acting. Choi Hyun-Wook (Ha Yi-chan) will be my favorite character of all time. He showed how to turn someone's shortcomings into something really beautiful with his outstanding delivery of emotions. I've never seen any of Shin Eun-soo (Cheong-ah) dramas, this is my first show and I was stunned to see her performance. Though she was deaf and dumb in the whole drama, her twinkling eyes spoke every emotion that can't be described with words. Whenever she smiles, you'll feel her joy, whenever she cries, you'll feel her sorrow and her silence will shatter your heart. Mother-son duo screen time will break and mend your heart at the same time for sure. The endearing love between Omma and appa, and Ajussi and ajumma will make your heart flutter. Seol In-ah's (Choi Se-kyung / On Eun-yoo) chemistry with Ryeoun was at top notch. Seol In-ah did a great job with her acting and showed that everyone has flaws and struggles in their life and that ending our life is not the only solution. Though the ending was bittersweet, it was the perfect ending that we all wanted. It ended with the note that everything happens for a reason, hold on there, and live your life to the fullest without pondering over the things.🍉 WATERMELON SUGAR....

tt27446493,"The characters are lovable and they played their part well. You'll fall in love with the main cast and hate the villains. It's a time travel romcom but this doesn't focus on the technically of time travel but rather the simple ""if you change some things in the past you change the future"" kind of thing. I did not read the details and trailer and just straight up watch this series. I was disappointed after finding out this is a time travel movie since I just finished watching ""A Time Called You"". Honest take, it is way better than this. I just don't get the very high rating. Probably because I saw A Time Called You first and thought it was brilliant. It's like you're coming in expecting part 2 of a movie to be better than the first however for this series it's not. It was dragging. A Time Called You only had 12 eps. This series has 16 eps but lots of filler scenes. Don't get me wrong, it's fun but this just doesn't deserve a 9 to me.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,Anyone who has seen Back to the Future will recognize the concept and premise. A teen goes back to the time of his parents youth. The K drama element is that it is more emotional and that is where the drama shines. There are some really touching scenes with the son and father and mother. He sees his parents own difficulties growing up and sees things from their POV.Also it's exciting to see if and how the future can be changed especially trying to avoid the accident that caused the father's deafness. Although irritatingly it seems too hard to stop the accident. Went on too long. The abusive teacher is a dramatic plot line. There have to be villains.The cast is exuberant and acts well. Ryeoun is good and Choi Hyun Wook is enthusiastic. Seol in Ah isn't as pretty as the character suggests as the prettiest girl in school though.The main faults are the length and the lack of funny moments. The drama should have been 12 episodes. There are lots of unnecessary and repeated scenes. And unnecessary dialogue. The first part is actually very confusing. There isn't that much story. Another fault is the comedy is often not funny. In fact it is just never funny. So it is like a musical drama but not a rom com. The writer just doesn't have a good sense of humor. Don't recall laughing at any joke. Did not like the ending that much. Rushed without a lot if explanation of the positive changes. Could have shortened the previous episodes to show more detailed explanation. He could not prevent his father's deafness and he had no memory of his better life. There is no way to explain time travel changes to everyone's satisfaction but in this show not enough of an effort was made.,negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"I just finished watching it and I can't stop the tears from falling. ""Viva la vida"". I realized I'm just really happy to be alive because I got the chance to watch the amazing drama ''Twinkling Watermelon"". Each and every single thing of the drama was so beautiful that the cocktail of feelings seeped into my chest and my veins, filling me with warmth from the inside out. It's the best healing & comfort kdrama ever existed. Everything of the drama was so perfect. The casts, songs, soundtracks,storyline,acting... every single thing was beyond perfect and beautiful. I'm just really thankful to watch the beautiful creation.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"Really good drama that lets its four leads sparkle. Twinkling Watermelon features themes of family and identity at various times in the characters' lives, and while it looks like a fun ride on its nostalgic surface, this series has bigger emotional payoffs simmering just under the surface. Boy, do the final two episodes serve up the full force of the writer's prowess. In the end, each character develops the tools to help them communicate better whether through signing, music, or simply summoning the courage to ask the questions they never could. The male leads are excellent especially in the finale episodes but it's Choi Hyun-Wook, who has shone in everything he's done to date, demonstrating again why he'll be the next big thing in Korean tv.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"There didn't seem to be any mention of the core of this story, which is the many ways that love can be expressed. And communication is a foundation for all to learn. I am a Coda and totally found this KDrama to be warm and well thought out.My deaf mother used to always buy a car that had a radio and good speakers ! Just because she couldn't hear didn't mean she didn't want me to appreciate music. She did always enjoy the vibrations from music.So I loved that they showed this in the story.And there are several gems of wisdom thru out the story line. I think I'd like to watch it again to highlight those moments to write down to remember.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"This is a charming show, with wonderful leads and a fine supporting cast. Time travel shows are always hard to pull off and while there are some plot holes, they are tolerable. I would have liked the final episodes to tell us more about the return to 2023, especially Eun-yoo's story but this is a minor complaint.In this show, a boy (Ryeoun) and a girl (Seoul In-ah) travel from 2023 to 1995, the boy to meet his father (Choi Hyun-wook), make sure he meets his future mom (Shin Eun-woo) and save him from a serious accident, the girl to escape her dysfunctional parents with the idea of changing the past so she will not be born. The two romances that ensue are heartfelt, even if many obstacles must be overcome.Much of the show tells of the band formed by the father, a high-schooler in 1995, which his time traveling son joins, the father's objective being to capture the heart of the girl (or her mother - you'll have to watch) and the son's being to prevent his father's accident. Comedy and drama intertwine. The series delicately and compassionately deals with the challenges faced by deaf people and CODAs (children of deaf adults).If there are to be some criticisms, perhaps some of the pantomime villainy of Shin's step-mother (Kim Joo-ryoung) could have been omitted. Also, while I find it, er, unpalatable having to watch another series enslaved by the all-powerful Korean catering industry, I also must offer up my respects to the inventor of the fast forward button that allows one to skip over the eating scenes without losing any of the story.I don't want to give away the plot, but it all works pretty well and the leads will keep you engaged throughout. Light fare that is eminently binge worthy.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Also, the acting of each member of this movie is indescribable.Apart from all this, the story of this series was so honest and pleasant that I don't think there will be another series like this. Yi Chan and Cheong Ah's love was infinitely pure and beautiful. Also, Eun Gyeol's passionate love and feelings for Se Kyung.This series made me feel good from the first episode to the last episode and I really fell in love with it.With this series, I laughed from the bottom of my heart, I cried hard, My heart felt real happiness, and most of all, it taught me a great life lesson.And I must also mention the music of this series, how amazing it was. I can't stop listening to his songs.

tt27446493,"Firstly,I'm gonna say that despite of all the negatives that I'll write below,I still think that this drama is interesting and have some of very lovable cast. But it simply doesn't deserve such a hype and high rating.This show brought kdrama-known slow motion to whole another level. It isn't even slow motion anymore,they drag some slow motion scenes to the point that you think that your screen is frozen,cause it probably is.The deaf girl,second FL has very sad and lonely life,but why does she have to be so rude and cocky to apsolutely everyone exept the boy she has a crush on? How can she fall in love with the person she never had any contact with but isn't capable to develope any kind of normal emotion with anybody else? I get why she is angry but she is way to rude and I simply don't see why would such a bubbly guy like Yi chan fall for her.And the last but not least,I just hate when kdrama writers put some average looking girl and present her as a epitome of beauty and every boy in every school is in love with her and I'm like,why? Are they blind? But I still try to like her but I CAN'T cause she has a role of some forced arrogant beauty. And not to mention her haircut;OMG.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"It was so highly rated and so much talked about, but I couldn't bring myself to watch it as I didn't find the plot too exciting.Finally I gave it a shot, as I love time traveling cinema, although I knew this was supposed to be less scifi time travel and more life emotional drama based.But I haven't seen such overrated kdrama. It nowhere deserves an almost 9/10 rating. It's a below average show.For starters, it is supposed to be an emotional depth drama with teenage fun and issues, and understanding our parents as teenagers. But sadly it falls flat on those parts. The two male leads, though had good chemistry and you can see them as friends, but couldn't connect on an emotional level, they hardly had any deep emotional exchange, except maybe a couple of scenes, one on the island and one in the end, but even those weren't impactful.The two main couples, neither of them had any romantic chemistry, neither they felt like a couple, if you are hoping this to be a romantic kdrama, then it isn't by any means , so don't watch it for romance reasons.A large core of the show is music, but I personally didn't like any of it, none of the songs made an impact and I didn't bother to even look them up to add to my music playlist, on the contrary after a while of same repetition of songs in their band practice sessions etc, I even skipped a few scenes of just same rock music playing and nothing else happening.A whole lot of ultra slow motion scenes, sometimes so slow it feels like your screen is frozen. Again, none of such slow motion scenes had any impact or depth. Usually kdramas are good at that. Not here.The only scenes which felt emotional, were between our ML and his now teenage mom who he meets in past, and they were introduced so late in the show, like happens around 7th episode, and the emotions and feelings were instantly visible, but they were so less, way too less. The amount of time spent on son and dad, not even 1/10 of the time was spent on son and mom, and that should have happened more, because she was in much more need of his help than anyone, learning sign language and getting bullied at school, from being a completely shut off person, to home abuse, she needed help in everything, and it would've been a lot better of a show if it was focused on these things. Instead of wasting so much time on creating band, and music and festival preparations etc.The biggest plothole for me was the FL part. She comes back, and in trying to set up her mother with her first love instead of his father, what was that ? Like she thought if she imitates her mother, and make the second male lead fall for her, and then she disappers, her actual teen mom comes back from US, , and then she'll magically become a couple with the second ML? She obviously knew that her mom never comes back from the US till years after she was born. Even if by any chance her mom comes back, she won't be a couple with second male lead. It was so rubbish that even explaining it is bothersome. That whole part that happens in first 11-12 episodes is absolute garbage and stupi and senselessThe acting was subpar with ML being good in emotional scenes.I won't even mention the details of how time travel happens, because that's just a tool used here without any explanation.Also, it falters in a very important reason. Why were both leads made to time travel? I can understand FL reason, as to why she was made to time travel, and it feels justified. But problem is that hers wasn't the core of the show and not even shown in the end. Hers was like a sub sub plot.The ML reason to time travel and then comeback wasn't impactful at all. ML and his family were already decently living, not ultra rich, but well settled. Both parents were loving, bond between brothers was great, ML wasn't having any major life altering issues, except that his dad found out about his guitar music love. And then he goes back, and then comes back to present. All he managed to do was make his family ultra rich. Their love and bonds didn't change, because there was no need for any improvement. His love for music found out by dad could've been easily resolved , as ML parents were so loving and understanding.On the contrary FL reason to travel back in time, understand her teen mom and come back to future, what changes she made, that wasn't even shown in the end, how her bonding with mom and her father, and between her parents improved or changed, it wasn't even shown.This show is totally messed up and plain garbage. A Time Called You, is way way way much better than this and so beautifully executed. Twinkling watermelon is the most overrated kdrama. Not at all recommended.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The acting in it is superb and the bromance between father and son had me more captivated than the love interests. Although, they did very well with the love interests as well for sure. This was such a heartfelt show and Choi Hyun-Wook had me obsessed with his acting. Ryeoun paired so well with Hyun-Wook that I loved ever minute of this drama. I loved the story, I loved the acting and it had a great ending...what more could you ask for? Because of Hyun-Wook's acting, I am now watching every show he has starred in and I am blown away by how good he is. Now I see why he won a best new actor award. I look forward to seeing him in many more dramas.Honestly, there is nothing I didn't like about this drama. It was engaging from the first episode and tugged at my heart strings the entire show. Not to give any spoilers, so I won't say who...but when one character does a solo song for someone...I about had a complete breakdown. The most beautiful thing ever!! It was one of the most perfect moments and this person solidifed themself to me as one of the best actors I have ever seen. All the actors on this show deserve some awards. This show will go down as one of the best kdrama's have to offer. That coming from 3 generations of us watching it. My mother, myself and my 17 year old daughter...all of us were obsessed.

The characters played by all 4 main cast are just to the point. Choi Hyun work is what the twinkling stands for. All the seriousness and soft supple element can be brought by just one being - Eun Soo. Ryeon and Seol are obviously flawless and carry the plot by themselves when it turns into a slice of life at moments.A must watch for all folks even if they never watched KDrama before.

Also the FL was amazing, her role was challenging but she slayed it and her sign language was beautiful and i really felt bad for her character as she was amazing in showing her emotions through her eyes and sign language.Second: when I watched this drama I felt like I was on a rollercoaster of emotions, you feel sad , happy, and you this drama feels like home.The relationship of Ml with his grandmother is very loving💕.Also one last thing I would like to add is the scene when the ML is deaf and his grandmother comes to see him but since he can't hear her he can't answer her so he pretends to ask her questions......oh my i bawled my eyes out ....i felt the pain in my heart(literally) ...so definitely a must watch<3.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

He always took care of Yi-, so it just seemed natural to me.After i found he wasn't, it also made sense. I could also see it from the other perspective now. How he wanted to protect his father at all costs, since his father still was (Extremely) wild. I liked that i could see the fatherly side from both perspectives.I loved how this series really made us wish that the future would change, but then we hoped it didn't. We got to see how happy they were, but also how Eun-Gyeol had such many difficulties.I was so concerned when, he began likin Se-Kyung , since it was in the 1990's, so I was extremely relieved when she also turned out to be a time traveler.It was also nice to see that they didn't figure it out in the first couple of seconds. Even after she took her moms place, Eun-Gyeol didn't notice. I really liked that.The end of the series was a bit depressing, but also necessary. We of course always knew, that Eun-Gyeol had to go home and that he couldn't stay in 1995 with his father. It made me so sad to think, that he had to leave his whole friend group behind, and i was so scared to see the ""Real"" world and how i turned out. We now of course know i turned out amazing, but it just felt a little rushed.The scene where he looks at his mother and his friends and remember them as teenagers literally made me bawl my eyes out.

The artists are very talented and each is able to portray their own character. I was so drawn to their acting that I didn't actually realize I was crying or laughing.This drama shows the reality how people with disabilities are often discriminated and maltreated. The society should stand up for the weak and disabled; indeed they are people too and are a part of the society. They need to be heard too!So this drama is able to instill to the viewers lessons and
values in life. With this alone, this drama deserves to be recognized and awarded.Thanks too to the scriptwriter, directors- acting, music score, lighting effects, wardrobe/costume and crew who must have worked so hard to overall success of the production.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

It teaches us that love has no language,love itself is a language,most beautiful one.Life could end up anyway, it's important to give it our best,not loose hope,there are people who care for you .It's a must watch drama.Being a teenager is a huge task itself, career pressure,peer pressure, insecurities, judgements,etc that one has to go through.

The young cast, the chemistry between Yichan and Eun-gyeol is wonderful. Usually time travel dramas become a whole lot messy but twinkling watermelon is a clean shot there were no confusions everything went smoothly. The songs in between episodes should also be acknowledged I grooved to every songs;) The drama also touch's upon the issue of the deaf and the struggle they face in communicating.This drama is a must watch to all who needs a break from all the complicated dramas airing.

I was pleasantly immersed in every episode of the story and slowly fell in love with each of the characters and their quirks. I adored the incorporation of sign language into the show and how it helped built relationships between each of the characters. The feeling of genuine connection in the show was amazing. This show is definitely my favourite of the year. I look forward to seeing others enjoy the series as well as other programs the leads are involved in.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Some things are always meant to be the way you don't want but you have to go through hardship for good results. I enjoyed the chemistry between 18 years old Hayichan and eungyeol. The ending wasn't clear enough like it didn't show seghyeong and eunyuh bonding in future. It was happy ending but wasn't clear. You have to understand it with your own by watching the drama.

That laugh, that singing, that lively personality. I was watching the whole series hoping to see him saved.But after watching 15 episodes - they went and showed in the last episode that IT IS WHAT IT IS.So he had gone back only to make them rich ?There has always been a lot of comparison between twinkling watermelon and lovely runner. Atleast in lovely runner the girl gets saved from getting injured and the guy gets to live. So we understand the whole reason for back and forth travel.Here it became pointless if destiny cannot be changed.And then not to mention the girls character who travels back and pretends to be her mom.How exactly can she change her moms destiny by pretending to be her?Her actual mom is in america doing what the original past is.So her pretending may complicate things for the characters in Korea. But does nothing to her own history.So that whole story line was baseless and silly to say the least.And they didn't even tell us in the end that HOW did her future change.She wasn't in the same house as before. So where did she go?So from being a 10 - it dropped dropped dropped until its at a 7the more I think over it - the more annoyed I get :(I would have loved a happy ending. For me this wasn't one.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The story was also very self-contained; a second season wouldn't fit at all.In the end, although you didn't really get to see Lee Chan work through his deafness with the help of Cheong Ah, which definitely should have been added, I feel like it wrapped up all of the major plot points very well.I will say I was a little disappointed that Eun Gyeol's life had changed so drastically when he went back to the future. Personally, I thought his life was already pretty good. It would have been more satisfying to see his parents as normal people, but very happy and with many more people in their lives. Just my personal feeling though. I think they did an amazing job with the music, the characters, and the feel of the story and would have changed very little.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

All people related to us aren't mere side characters in our life, they have their own life in which we are the side characters for them. We can't live their life for them. Nor can they do so for us.

I'm looking forward to seeing and hearing rewards for all involved.At first I was confused but as I continued to watch patiently, I caught on and it all made sense.

I love time travel themed shows, and this one was such a heart warming story, of family, love, friendship, dreams, love and loyalty! I loved all the characters, especially the ones from 1995, and I felt the dilemma, confusion, happiness and sadness with every character, especially the ML, right with him. The actress who played Cheong-Ah in 1995 was super cute and I simply loved her innocence and expressions. One discovered that the disability of the ML's dad was not congenital, rather due to an accident at the age of 18, but even if it was 1995, hearing aids were available to people who could speak but just couldn't hear. I mean one can understand how Beethoven became deaf and couldn't be treated in the 1700s, but it is beyond me why Ha Yi Chan couldn't be given a hearing aid!

He just fits this happy go lucky high school guy role perfectly that no other actor can replace him. The plot is really beautiful and it feels therapeutic to watch. The visuals, cinematography, ost everything just seemed perfect.I do feel that it has few flaws here and there - like how chung ah's father was unaware of the cruel treatment she'd been receiving, and chung ah being unnecessarily rude in scenes few scenes, etc. But it's fine the story overall is so serene and uplifting that you don't really care about these.The ending is bittersweet for sure, but it's still nice and satisfactory ( don't worry it's not gonna rip your heart unlike twenty five twenty one :p )",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Actors were acting they came straight from the real life. I assumed many times as if the writer just had a long dream and decided to make it into a series.Surprisingly first episode had cry like a baby.

tt27446493,"So, Twinkling Watermelon... the first thought that would've come to mind is ""What a weird name"". A normal reaction because even if we are used to weird namings of K-dramas, food has mostly never been used in titles.But be that as it may, Twinkling watermelon brought on a flurry of emotions to anyone watching it.It was tough at times, having to wait an entire week for the continuation of the story haha, but we all got through that somehow.Twinkling Watermelon was like a breath of fresh air to be honest. Contrary to a typical K-drama romance, this one involved Time Travel and boy did it help enhance the story.Meeting his father when he was younger and becoming friends with him must have been a surreal experience. Learning about the life of his mother and father before they got married, experiencing first hand the hardships they had to go through, and learning about his father's accident and his mother's struggles all helped EunGyeol realize that his Mother and Father were not always as happy as they were during the present and that what may be shown on the surface is not always true.The show had many emotional parts that had us on the edge of our seats too sometimes, haha. But it also had had it's fair share of enjoyable parts, especially how the relationships between the Main Leads changed over time and how Eungyeol tried his best to match his mother and father up as soon as possible, even at one time being misunderstood (due to his actions) that he ""liked"" his father.As we got closer to the end, I was always anxious as to how/what the ending is going to be but safe to say, I wasn't disappointed. The ending was well executed and the buildup during the last episode was EXTREME to say the least. The uncertainty that went through every watcher's mind as they watched the last episode was completely eliminated during the last few minutes of the show. But well done Writer for making us so anxious during the episode!Overall, Twinkling Watermelon had an amazing story, proper development between leads, a good pacing, and a well executed ending and for that reason I'd recommend it to anyone interested in watching it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Well, the series IS that in a way, but the first chapters were funny, the acting was delightful, and the addition of the music topic kept me interested. Being Latin-American and the mother of a deaf child, both the visceral playing of a Spanish guitar and the introduction of signal language kept me interested.Later, I found the development of the characters and the intricate three-generation children-parent histories both brilliant and mesmerizing. Pure entertainment, but the message of ""not to give up to giving up"" was powerfully conveyed even amid the funniest comedic scenes.I strongly recommend this series, which is very universal and ""visual"", easy to be followed with subtitles.Kudos to actors, directors and writers that created such a well-adjusted woven of emotions that will appeal to everyone!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt27446493,"I love every bit of this show, except for tiny one. Yeah time travel is an incredibly complex plot to cover and yes this show makes it seem like a child's play, therefore you should NOT except consistency in that case whatsoever, you'll understand me if you've watched 12 Monkeys or Dark. But this show isn't actually about time travel anyways. It's about friendship, love, family. It's about forming sincere bonds. It makes your heart melt in some scenes, makes you laugh out loud in some others. Not only do characters bond with each other but you as the viewer also bond with them. It can easily become anyone's comfort show. THAT is the reason I love it so so much.But...
Spoiler comes here, don't read if you haven't finishedI really couldn't bring myself liking their ultimate end. I understand that Cheong-ah comes from a wealthy family and she made up with her father in 1995 and that means her new future could change in a way. But I don't think they needed to become this forefront successful ""business"" family to be ""better"". For me their former family was also so sincere, lovely, and just as enough. They didn't have so much money before, but they had everything else. Did they really needed to be ultra rich and famous to be happier? In fact when I saw that they happened to become such big famous people as a family, I kind of dissociated with them. That is my only criticism and hence my rating. I wish we could see their new future condition in a more sincere setting rather then being exposed how they became high society. The writers really must have thought this is the most fulfilling ending: seeing them rich and having power. I couldn't disagree more. I would prefer to see them for example having their breakfast on a Sunday morning, in which I-chan's friends happen to be there, chatting and laughing together.

Eun Gyeol has done so well telling us what FAMILY means to him. Same goes to Yi Chan where he treat his friends so well. The romance between the Eun Gyeol n Se kyong also interesting to watch as both actors show good chemistry between them.

tt13274038,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020/2021 South Korean television drama with 16, 73 minute episodes. Lim Ju-kyung (Moon Ga-young), feels like she was cursed as the only ugly child among her siblings. As somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy her vision of herself and lack of confidence has led to bullying at school and less than kind comments even at home. Looking for a solution she stumbles upon internet makeup videos and learns to expertly hide her cosmetic flaws just Asher family moves and she transfers schools. The makeup enhances what is Ju-kyung's underlying beauty and her new schoolmates think she is beautiful, like a goddess. Her newfound confidence is fragile and she is determined no one at her new school ever see her bare face. A mutual love of heavy metal type music and horror comics leads Ju-kyung and her extraordinarily handsome classmate, Lee Su-ho (Cha Eun-woo), to cross paths when Ju-kyung is not wearing makeup. Ju-kyung is convinced that the difference is dramatic enough Su-ho will not connect the Goddess with the ugly duckling she thinks she is without makeup. It is not long though before Su-oh realizes it is the same girl and Ju-kyung strikes a bargain with Su-oh to keep her secret. Su-ho and his former friend Han Seo-jun (Hwang In-yeop) had a falling out over a tragic incident in their past. At first Seo-jun pays attention to Ju-kyung to bother Su-oh but soon discovers he also likes the beautiful and sweet
Ju-kyung. The boys grow closer as they rival each other for the girl's attention and begin to learn about and resolve issues from their past. Will Ju-kyung realize her true potential and gain confidence even without makeup? Spoilers**I absolutely loved this drama, every minute of it. The casting was near perfect as they looked so much like the Manga characters. There was a strong social message about bullying and the detrimental effects on self esteem. I liked how she found solace in the transformative power of make-up. I would have happily had her end up with either 1st or second guy. I loved her sister and her confident p, go for it, tomboy attitude. The way her little brother and her constantly teased, scuffled and irritated each other but, when the chips were down, they were the first to jump to their siblings defense. Su-ho was handsome and popular and seemed to have it all but his mother died at a young age and a misunderstanding had him estranged from his famous father. Su-ho and Seo-jun and Su-ho used to be friends but a tragic event caused a seemingly insurmountable rift to form between the two friends. It also explored the very deep topic of suicide and the lasting impact it has on the loved ones of the person who ended their own life. Love and friendship builds up Ju-kyung to the point she is no longer afraid of the bullies nor her unmade up face. I did not follow the web too but my daughter explained and showed me relevant parts. She said it was a perfect balance of following the Webtoon to capture what made it a success while departing, as needed, to make it work wel, in a shorter format.

Great acting by both eunwoo and ga young but her character was annoying at times especially knowing her insecurities were mainly related to her acne and she thought the only way to hide them was to wear makeup, not go to a dermatologist and fix it but wear makeup everyday to school and make it even worse. It made no sense. The real star of the show was definitely in youp, great acting and you find yourself rooting for him throughout the whole thing. He truly had the best character development delivered in the best way possible, he better get a main role soon because he got potential.

tt13274038,"This highly anticipated show has an over the top sometimes almost painful exaggerated style. It's not as funny as it should be sometimes. Maybe the source material is like that. Not sure the premise about the make up no make up difference holds up. She isn't that ugly with the glasses and no makeup to be bullied for it and she isn't that stunning with makeup. The message about looks mattering so much seems awkwardly handled. Although with the romance picking up it is getting more interesting and the backstory about the suicide. The love triangle is promising. This show doesn't take itself too seriously but compared to similar shows I prefer 18 Again and Gangnam Beauty in terms if their tone and approach. Things get slightly better as the episodes progress. Episode 6 is quite funny.
The cast are well chosen and suit their roles in appearance. Moon Ga Young is enthusiastic and does well considering. Cha Eun Woo looks like a WEBTOON character come to life. Hwang In Yeop has an also comic book look. The grown ups are pretty top actors. Like Seo Dan's mom from CLOY Jang Hye Jin as her mom and SKY Castle's Jung Joon Ho as his Dad.
OK for a teen show with a good cast.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Even till the last scene you'll be hanging thinking about what Seo Jun might be feeling. The writing part of the romantic storyline could have been better.The acting - 10/10
Great acting by the complete cast! So that's a plus that made me rate it 8/10

I've been bouncing back and forth amongst team SUHO and team SEOJUN, but now that i think of it.. i feel like Seojun deserves Jugyeong more than SuHo. Seojun is a hardworking boy who changed 90% of his personality for jugyeong, he even decided to continue his dream for Jugyeong ~(sorry I can't give much spoilers)~ :( .

tt13274038,"I'm a huge fan of the webtoon and was so excited to hear about a live-action series starring EUNWOO. He's always been the most popular fan-cast for Suho and I was so happy when I found out he was cast, although I did think Suho is too similar to his character in My ID is Gangnam Beauty. Even the plot is similar, but the character of Han Seojun made everything better.I do think some scene are cringey, especially with the editing. Moon Gayoung's acting gets cringey and overacting too, but I think the director/s just wanted her to do something similar to the webtoon version, so it's not really her fault. Inyeop is probably the best in the cast, and his character is also the best among the three mains. Eunwoo also improved from his acting in Gangnam and Rookie Historian, but the lack of range in these 3 shows doesn't give him justice.The series tackled very serious topics about depression, but it was only used for the love triangle purposes. It saddens me because it's such a pivotal part in Suho and Seojun's friendship. Had it been taken seriously, I would have liked this series better.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt13274038,"This is honestly now one of my fave tv shows and probably my favourite korean drama. I wasn't too interested initially as it seemed like a typical high school drama with cringey predictable plot and I actually stopped watching it after episode 1 in January because it seemed very predictable but I was very wrong.But then I started watching it again in Sept and OMG I BINGED WATCHED THE WHOLE THING IN THE ONE WEEKEND BECAUSE IT BECAME SO INTERESTING.Cha Eun Woo really shines here. His acting is amazing and his character development is brilliant. He goes from being cold to warm but in a genuinely believable way. Moon Ka Young and Hwang In Yeop really bring a lot of charisma and high energy to the table. The secondary characters are hilarious and you become just as invested in their stories as the main leads.Highly, highly recommend you watch this as the plot becomes very emotional and you will laugh, cry and be angry at the same time.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It really allowed you to feel satisfied, rather than the ""well what the hell did I waste my time on that for?"" that you quite often get left with.Absolutely recommend it. I particularly enjoyed the storylines of the secondary characters.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"I'm a little late to finish the show but I absolutely loved it. The original webtoon did include a lot more but I like the way they were able to keep some of the stuff from the original while adding their own little twist to it. This show can be corny at times but I like it, it feels like an actual comic story. The romance is well developed and really good. I like how they displayed the message of loving yourself. The makeup the character wore wasn't the problem; the problem was that we didn't love how she looked without it. The show is about learning to accepting who you are. This show not only had funny scenes but a lot of emotional ones as well. I do recommend if you'd like to watch a fun well written romance comedy drama.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"This K-Drama is certainly not amazing. The lack of character development from the main character is irritating. In general, she isn't that lovable. She doesn't come to terms with anything and she doesn't help herself either.Sohoo isn't bad, he's the regular reserved heartthrob, but he comes off as a bit emotionless to me. I wasn't a big fan as I'm not into this type of guys but he was cute for the most part.Seo-Jun had the best character development and personality. He was attractive and had a lot to offer. But in my opinion, he deserves someone better than Ju Kyung.Selena! I loved her! Sassiness but controlling, yet fair and direct. I would ONLY watch a season 2 if it included a make up artist - idol relationship with her and seojun!Something I have to mention, I enjoyed the side stories. Which isn't usual sometimes they can be a bore. But I loved the sister so much! She was one of the best characters in this show. Her relationship with the teacher is so cute.Overall, it's not a bad drama. It's worth a watch if you don't mind tropes and cheesy stuff. I was going to give it a 5, but that's kinda low and a 7 is too high.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt13274038,"The beginning of the show was too cringe with the ""ugly"" looks with thickened eyebrows... And the female lead always falling and stuff.And why all the guys in korean dramas are too possessive... But what I liked is that she is defending herself much more in the drama then the webtoon. Also the big sister is awesome in the drama! She's not the cliché female character and her husband at the end is so cute and emotional. I think it's really good to break gender stereotypes like that.Another bad thing is one of the less interesting character is the female lead in my opinion. Also she never rails about what she likes about Suho and Seo-jun personality wise... Everything about her is superficial, she only cares about her appereance. The show criticiezd superficiality but act superficial. The guys are just ""handsome"" and they bring that up all the time !What I really didn't like is that in the webtoon this is really a love triangle, in the drama not really, towards the end we see less and less of Seo-jun. He makes lots of sacrifices for her, he respects Suho and doesn't even say how he réels by respect. Then Suho goes and when he comes back it's like he never left...
Now I am comming to the biggest problem for me at the show. There are no consequences to anything that happened. Every character ended up with their high school sweetheart. Even her best friend that broie up 16 times with her boyfriend got back together. The relationship of her mom and her dad nothing changed either even if she was beating up her husband! Un my opinion it normalizes toxic relationship.So there is nothing really changed except Seo-jun who sings again.The interesting thing about growing up is that things changes, but in the drama it feels like nobody really grow up.Finally, we had so little moments with Seo-jun, there was no more a love triangle but a second character that comes sometimes to make Suho jelous. She was never really in love with him or never had hard time to choose. And that was just boring and sad because personally I thought that Seo-jun was a much more realistic and friendly character. He showed us a more friendly and warm kind of love. And why they always end with the rich guy omg ! He was one of the most interesting characther in the show and they didn't even uses him.I hope there will be a second season which this time things really change and people grow up and fix the problems. And I hope we will see more of Seo-jun and they will end Up together.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt13274038,"This was a fun romance with a fun love triangle. The two guys vying for the affection of one girl was a lot of fun to watch. But when the love triangle involving the girls arrives, that's when it gets vicious and cruel. At the Crux of it all I feel like it's girls being jealous of other girls. This is a story about self-esteem and inner strength. And also loving yourself for who you are no matter what.The part that confused me about this show is that the central character was it ugly at all. She wasn't ugly without makeup and she wasn't as beautiful as they claimed she was with it. In fact I thought she looked better without the makeup. And I'm not just saying that. I thought she looked too much like the other girls with the makeup. The way they were carrying on you would have thought she was a monster and even without makeup she was prettier than most of the other girls in the school. What she was lacking was courage and self-esteem. So for me I found it hard to suspend belief that a pretty young lady is supposed to be ugly simply because she has pimples on her face. Or that it is criminal or even deceitful to wear makeup. But the show is handled well and I think it has a good message with the protagonist caring about her no matter how she looked. Su
Ho is a guy who sees beyond the superficial unlike everyone else. To me he was mature in a well-rounded character despite his mood swings and struggles with his past. Also Seo Jun sees beyond the superficial because of the tragedy with their friend and their own history with seeing what bullying does to another human being.I felt the mother of Im Gyeong was very insensitive to her daughter. There is no way I would allow anyone to say that my daughter is ugly or unattractive. I would probably bite their heads off. Her mother did not create empowerment in her daughter by allowing people in the community to point out her features and call her unattractive. So the girl never really learned how to defend herself. Other than those quibbles the story was also a lot of fun and had a lot of hilarious moments that I enjoyed. I typically don't watch any shows centered around the lives of teenagers. I tend to find those shows very annoying. At times the kids on the show were hyperactive so I took breaks between binge watching so that it didn't wear on my nerves. But I would rank this show in my top 10 kdramas.I really liked how the two young men were very supportive of Im Gyeong throughout. The bullies were all ridiculous and despicable. And I really wanted them to have a severe comeuppance. I wanted Im Gyeong to stand up to them and grow a spine. I enjoyed the subplots and other love stories.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The plot has very serious and deep aspects to it which the series had would sometimes turn comedic, especially with the topic of bullying, depression, and suicide.

The comic book shop and the girl's room, especially, were created with such detail that they were nice to watch.The bromance was pretty entertaining as well. The two male leads had chemistry and they provided a lot of funny moments. The start of the drama was interesting as well, with some intense moments and dramatic twists. There were some funny scenes in this drama as well, and the second couple were really cute!However, the rest of it was average. The love triangle was weak, with the second lead being interesting in her towards the middle of the length, and even then the female lead didn't seem to notice him at all.

Having no character development is a big no-no for me.Another bad thing is how it delved too far away from the webtoon where it originated.

However, it still comes off a cute romantic comedy drama that is not exactly a 'must-watch' but a potential 'can-watch'.Lim Joo-Kyung is bullied for her looks - just a puffed up face and a few acnes make her 'ugly' and in desperation to survive, she learns the art of makeup which truly transforms her face - the make up artists have done a phenomenal job in this.Now 'beautiful', Jo-Kyung struggles to keep her secret under the wraps as the two most popular guys of the school start to hit on her, and thanks to her beauty, she is literally called goddess.Excluding the re-enforcement of gender stereotypes in K Dramas, True Beauty is not a pain to watch. I'm actually quite impressed by how many ideas they come up with in each episode to keep us hooked on the screen.Sometimes some scenes feel repetitive and some, unnecessary but none of that made me quit the show though except for the last two episodes - they really tried to pull a 'friends' moment there and failed terribly.To conclude, True Beauty is a drama which you can watch every day to get past your boring evenings, nothing more, nothing less.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"It's rather curious that two recent kdramas that try to mock society's obsession with external beauty - My ID Is Gangnam Beauty and True Beauty - both star probably the best-looking kdrama actor today, Cha Eun Woo. His characters in both dramas are also similar - aloof with other people but passionate and faithful when it comes to the object of their affection. My kind of leading man. So I don't mind him being type-casted in this role. It suits him and it's always a treat to watch him onscreen.In True Beauty, Lim Ju Kyung (Moon Ga-young) gets bullied for being ugly in her school. Fortunately, her family moves to another area and she gets the opportunity to start over in new surroundings. She covers up her ugliness with makeup and becomes popular in her new school where she gets entangled with the school heartthrob Lee Su Ho (Cha Eun Woo). But she becomes utterly fearful of her bare-face being found out. Frankly, I don't see the big deal about this as a lot of women cover their imperfections with makeup. Also, it seems her only problem is her skin. If she can spend all that money on makeup and even consider having plastic surgery, why not just focus her efforts on taking care of her skin?In any case, despite the rather flimsy reason for much of Ju Kyung's grief in the drama, that is, her ugliness being found out, the drama is entertaining, with several funny scenes including parodies of other dramas like The King Eternal Monarch and Crash Landing On You. The romance, which becomes a triangle, is heartwarming.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It seems the only people who were transformed were the supporting characters like Sujin and Seojun and even Junkyung siblings. The collateral overwhelmed the core, and that was a disappointment.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Soo Ho is so basic, all he does is smile and look cute. Soo Ho and Ju Jyung's characters were so boring IMO. If she liked all this horror/grunge/rock stuff, they shoulda made her look and act the part at least.Still finished it. I only shed some tears when the mom found out she was bullied.

I laughed out loud so many times, I think it's the funniest K-drama I've seen yet. I loved the characters, who started off very tropey but pleasantly surprised me by upending those tropes. The characters all seemed REAL. And some of the things they did weren't good, a lot were downright awful, but at least the writing mostly allowed the audience to understand the motivations and emotions involved in the characters' decisions. For the most part the relationships between the characters were intriguing and realistic, and the drama of their interactions seemed natural and not the forced, drama-for-drama's sake business which I hate.

This drama teaches that a person should be loved for the soul, and not for the appearance. The scriptwriters showed the audience how those who mock others look from the outside. It looked really terrible. I felt hatred for the offenders. Love is also shown here sincerely. But the love triangle is bad. Breaks hearts, I would say.

tt13274038,"As someone who has been following the Webtoon, I initially tried to compare the plotline and character arcs as I watched the 'live action', and I'm glad I quickly decided it's plain counter-productive (not to mention a setup for disappointment) to do this kind of cross-media comparison anyway.After all, professionally speaking, it would be quite unfair and unrealistic to expect the 'live action' adaptation to strictly follow the backstory, plot development and all the character relationships as per the original Webtoon; I'm glad this 'live action' showcased a screenplay and direction that is rather unique in its own right.Here are the main questions I took into consideration as I watched this series:
1. Does the overall story carry its own weight? YES (it addresses the theme of ""true beauty"" quite consistently; watch this as a standalone, so no need to read the webtoon to get anything; also, backstories, side stories and character relationships in the show are more dynamic and interesting compared to the source material)
2. Is the plot well-developed? YES (no terribly unforgiveable plotholes or too many drag-in-the-mud moments)
3. Are the characters well-portrayed? YES (the casting was really well done overall; key characters are all relatable enough and the chemistry believable; I must say that there's pretty good development in the two male lead characters unlike in the webtoon)
4. Bingeworthy? YES (quite well-paced and well-timed cliffhangers; best devoured over long weekends)
5. Sentimental level? Low to moderate; campy in a good, entertaining way (you have the Kdrama tropes but they're not too-cringey that they detract from the story progression)
6. Re-watch-ability? High (Execution-wise, it's one of the better Kdramas that qualifies for the hall of classics)
7. Major complaints? Some emo moments are unnecessarily drawn out, with some gratuitous montage or filler moments (which feel like time wasters) but hey, this is Kdrama!

tt13274038,"I know people like to call romance-oriented dramas ""guilty pleasures,"" but I prefer to think of True Beauty as comfort food. It has all the familiar tropes of older kdramas, but it always knows how to put a fun new spin on them in order to keep viewers engaged and interested.
Lim Jugyeong is a wonderful female lead, brought to life perfectly by Moon Gayoung, and her growth over the course of 16 episodes is believable and rootable. Cha Eunwoo, aside from being eye candy, gives his all to Lee Suho and really makes you feel pain and his love for Jugyeong.
Hwang Inyeop and Park Yoona may be treated very differently by the narrative in their respective second lead positions, but they are delightful and help round out a perfect cast.
In fact, every major character is memorable and exciting, with some twist or extra infusion to make them stand out from the high school drama pack. There are also fun dream sequences, bliss-tastic OST choices, and plenty of ""restaurant ending"" scene moments to go around.
If you love romance and kdramas, you cannot go wrong with True Beauty - as long as you don't get too invested in picking a team and instead let Jugyeong's feelings guide yours.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"True Beauty is a teen romance I put off watching for a while, as I sometimes find high-school dramas to be too immature. I was well aware of the show while it aired, and so I knew how the story was going to turn out. That being said, it was easy to see why so many people got SLS, as Soo-Ho was an extremely un-likeable character, while Seo Jun was a dork with a bad boy image that was very endearing. Ju-Kyung was easily the best character in the show, well written and well acted. It was clearly ridiculous that she was considered ""ugly"" with no make-up as Moon Ga-Young is very pretty, but I understood the sentiment. They gave very little screen time to the SML, which was disappointing as he was the more interesting of the two MLs in my opinion. There were a lot of un-likeable characters in this, but honestly I think that was fine because it felt realistic - teenagers do behave like the characters in the show, so I just allowed myself to enjoy the ride. The show handles the 16 episode time-span well, the story filled all 16 episodes and did not feel dragged out. The bully plot-line was well done and often difficult to watch, although the sound-effects/music often made scenes feel heavy handed. The show is absolutely chock-full of cliche's, but they were woven into the show in a way that felt organic and fun. There is not really anything original here in a rom-com k-drama, but it still felt worth the watch. I adored the older sister's plot line, she was easily the coolest character.Overall this was a decent watch and I enjoyed it quite a bit. A 6.5 rounded up to a 7.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I liked the plot its not a very extraordinary story but the actors did justice to their characters. Also rooting for team HAN SEO JUN.. will i ever get over them? No, but life goes on. Han seo Jun's acting was way better than suho when it comes to expressions & reactions. My heart also pumped for team suho and jugyeong. I heard it's based on webtoon and webtoon is way better than this version of drama, read people venting about how writer did not do justice to seo jun character and honestly i was shouting running around my house when i read seo jun and jugyeong dated in webtoon , would have loved to watched that in drama but i am sure they did justice to seo Jun's character in drama too. They were trying to show him as a bad boy but actually he was the softest bad boy ever in k drama history with zero toxicity. How he respected jugyeong , keeps joking around her, respecting her boundaries i mean he could totally steal jugyeong from suho but instead he was always by her side even before her face was revealed and after too, meanwhile getting his heart ripped off. Proved himself a great friend to suho, totally a green flag!Suho is also a green flag and honestly he deserved jugyeong (why it's also introvert male lead with an extrovert female lead anyways).Loved the character of jugyeong her humor ,her transformation and finally in the end, accepting her self, leading her way into her most passion. She deserved the all the encouragement from her school and family which she received

The acting Cha Eun-woo's'[Lee Su-ho' acting had no emotion I couldn't tell if he was happy ,sad or angry which made the drama a little bit confusing hopefully he can improve on his emotions while acting.

This adaptation goes into much more detail with side characteres and gives them a much bigger spotlight rather than focusing only on Jugyeong like in the Webtoon. The comedy is just brilliant and I found myself laughing out loud almost all the time while watching this show! It's also one of the few shows where I actually felt sad and almost teared up a bit when they showed sad and dramatic moments. They don't overdo it, but when they do make something sad, it has real impact rather than making me want to fast forward through the entire scene. It's nothing super complex, but the characters and fun interactions will just make you want to keep watching forever.

There is great music throughout especially the song that is the main song of the drama, and good talent singing it. 2 guys falling for the same girl rival for her but one relationship is one-sided the whole time. The sour thing that I don't really like is that suicide is brought into the drama. Also, didn't particularly like in this drama or other drama's for that matter that have the main lead leaves for years and then comes back. Never cared for that type of scripting- 2 years later...... and then the story gets continued. Took off 2 stars for the 2 years.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It was original, the fact that, for once the second character get a development was unusual , the main character was adorable , original and I was craving for more episodes. They were plot twist you don't often see and it felt more down to earth than other webtoon or drama. I was so excited when I learned about the drama and started it full of hope and joy... and what a disappointment. They change all the little things that made me attached to the characters. They transformed it into another boring drama where you can easily predict the end. And I keep asking myself ""why?"" They just had to follow the webtoon... i'm so sad , the casting was great and the drama was pretty... so why?

It not only kept me thoroughly entertained but also brought a nostalgic touch, transporting me back to my school days. If you're expecting a super serious and sensational series, this might not be it.

Loved SuJeon more , he reminded of Lee jong gi alot , especially the eyes, his acting and character were top notch, i think the show should have ended on episode 14, after it peaked, that she learned to overcome her bullies and finally accepted herself . The last two episodes were totally unnecessary , why on earth would you break up with her if you were taking care of your ill father, could ve kept in contact, i wanted the show to explore this kind of support, it aint always romance and flowers, loved the phone-call that Lim ju keong's mother had with SuHoo about how he s fairing, they could've shown a wonderful side to it, but instead it went down the drain for just a stupid twist and to allow the audience to explore her relationship with SuJeon. Could ve been done differently or from the beginning when they became friends, how they handled it didn't make any sense, felt like fillers. Only continued watching coz i loved the show so much.

Unlike most kdrama heroines, she is not the typical pretty girl which I'm sure is like most of us! I know for a fact that there is no way in any of the seven seas that I fit any beauty standard anywhere. True Beauty teaches us that it's okay to be not okay, it's okay to fall down and stare at the sky hopelessly, but it's unhealthy to live on the ground forever.The scene where Jugyeong walked into school bare-faced, when she was scared,afraid and nervous but still smiled anyways, I was so proud of her until at some point I realised that Jugyeong is me. Jugyeong is you. Jugyeong is each and everyone of us, who have faced obstacles, who have faced people telling us we don't belong and we can still go on. In facing her worst nightmare, Jugyeong has achieved her greatest dream which is acceptance where it matters. Acceptance from her true friends and loved ones.

They're all very talented and have faces to swoon over (even the supporting roles!!!) and I just couldn't stop staring at them plus I'm a big fan of the main trio. I love Moon Gayeong and Cha Eunwoo and despite his small role as a supporting character Hwang In Yeop really cought my attention in the Tale of Nokdu.
All three of them had great chemistry with each other and just seeing their characters interacting with each other was good enough for me. The plot really took a backseat.As for the message of the show, in my opinion they really failed at displaying it. I'm sure they meant to bring across that no one can define your beauty but yourself and that confidence and self-love and self-acceptance is the key but instead they glorified makeup and made it seem like cosmetics solve your problem with bullies but kids, that ain't it!!! Especially not if you have the face of Moon Gayeong. Not even acne skin can make her truly ugly.And the way they put characters with beautiful faces on a pedestal and seeing everyone around them glorifying the ""beauties"" like popstars was really sickening.Conclusion:

Can Eun-Woo, Huang In-Youp, Park Yoo-Na were great! Super casting.But what makes this one of the ***best RomComs ever*** is Moon Ga-Young. Her performance is just insanely good. The subtle voicing, the expressions, the range of emotions (from giddy to traumatic) - utter perfection. Simply put no actor could do better. Then only performance I can compare it to is Yoo In-Na in Touch Your Heart, which also was perfection and basically untouchable. TYH as a drama wins out because of the overall story and the performance and chemistry with Lee Dong-Wook. So a huge shout-out to Moon Ga-Young. She made this laugh-out load hilarious and so captivating. Oh, yeah, and she is beautiful on top of all that talent.The story is fun, and cute, and holds your attention from start to finish. And of course this drama has an important, positive message. The full package, for sure.Mild spoilers alert.Here are my only negative thoughts:
It is super frustrating to wait for Lee Woo-Ho (Cha Sun-Woo) to express his feelings. Argh!I HATE HATE love triangles, but give the writers credit for Han Seo-Jun's manning up (so to speak) and realizing it was not to be. Hwang In-Youp pulled this off with great aplomb.The KDrama trope of things falling apart near the end, only to be rescued at the last minute.

tt21874396,"For those who loved the original ""Parasyte"" anime and movies, ""Parasyte: The Grey"" is a definite must-see. I recently binged through all six episodes, and I must say, I was hooked from the get-go. While the detectives may make some questionable decisions in certain episodes, it's possible the creator intended for us to see the story unfold from the unique perspective of the female lead - a half-parasyte and half-human girl - navigating the complexities of our human world. Despite these minor hiccups, the show remains a thrilling ride from start to finish, making it well worth a watch.""The cast delivered stellar performances, with a dash of humor courtesy of the male lead. What's great is that even if you're new to the ""Parasyte"" universe, you can easily jump into ""The Grey"" without feeling lost. The series cleverly introduces the alien invasion storyline through a detective's eyes, offering a refreshing take on the familiar concept.While the aliens' goal remains the same - wiping out humanity - the plot takes unexpected twists and turns that kept me on edge. It's exciting to see the universe expanding in new and surprising ways. I have a strong feeling a second season is on the horizon, given the show's success and fan enthusiasm.I accidentally started watching in Tamil, my native language, and it added an unexpectedly funny touch to the whole experience. The climax was a real nail-biter, blending action, suspense, and intrigue seamlessly. Overall, ""Parasyte: The Grey"" is a solid addition to the genre, offering a fresh take that both newbies and long-time fans can enjoy.""",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"I have an understandable fear when it comes to anime live action adaptation, especially when we talk about shows where CGI is required, but this was executed relatively well.The story is good, but not perfect. It can be seen that it uses similar topics compared to the original, when the series elaborate on what being a human means, but the series definitely made those topics its own with its own plot points. Pacing-wise - because the story tries to be a bit more complex at certain points - the first half can feel a bit slow.For the characters, the main cast is much more unique personality-wise. Like from acting you could tell who has a bigger role in the series. I wouldn't call it bad and it made the characters interesting and less boring, but sometimes it was like that the main cast are the players in a game and everyone else is an NPC. The main cast was good and their characters felt real and developed with the story.About the technical aspects, the sound directing and OST were good. Nothing exceptional, but worked perfectly.Directing and editing, again it was good overall, nothing exceptional. There was one really good chase scene without a single cut.About the CGI and effects, errr... it look good, there was maybe one scene where it looked a bit funny, but even in daylight it looked okay. One little complaint maybe about the blood. They surprisingly low amount of blood. I mean people got beheaded and there wasn't a lot of blood there.And I would say the weakest part was the choreography. When it comes to normal hand to hand or weapon to weapon combat there are some really good scene out there. We spent decades on creating good looking fights, but here they should have developed a new fight, because the parasites head could shapeshift into a tentacle monster. I believe they failed to do that.In many cases, while the tentacle fights look cool in a close up, but from a bit afar it looks like they are tied to bodies and their bodies don't do anything just stand there. Imagine a rock with a tentacle, the rock sits in one place while the tentacle fight.They could have came up with some more unique or interesting fights.All in all, good to watch, at least once.

tt21874396,"I came into this expecting a live action adaptation of the manga/anime, but they ended up using new characters and a new setting to tell a different story. At first I was just going to cut the show off, but I decided to give it a chance and honestly..It's not bad. They stick to the rules that were developed inside of the book and show pretty well, the only thing that concerned me was the head swapping. There is 1 parasite that swaps bodies a lot but in the source material, swapping bodies was regarded as pretty dangerous. I also don't understand why they'd swap bodies when they had the ability to change the way their faces looked in the book/show.I'm not a film critic and I am not going to pretend to be like other reviewers. The show is a decent watch for fans of the series. It's not as deep in terms of philosophy and character development as the book/show but it's a good time passer.

It's a smart, gritty, no-nonsense crime/scifi drama that wastes no time in moving the story forward.The two lead cast members are extremely likeable.

From the music, the camera work, the acting, the effects, the twist in how the mutation work. I just hope this manages to touch on some of the big questions that the original anime did.

The rest of us who aren't, may not be able to look past the bad CGI, funny head-banging everytime parasytes fight while it can never be clear who managed to inflict anything. Must be embarassing for the actors involved.I was looking forward to another creature feature from the Korean creators that I usually enjoy, while waiting for Gyeongsong Creature season 2, but was disappointed.Patchy flow of events, mostly unlikeable characters, too fake-looking of creatures, unbelievable coincidences/logic, like seriously even civilians' cars have dash cams but someone can get away killing a police asset while being surrounded by parked police cars.The most cringe though, has got to be the team leader lady. Her acting sucks, it baffles me why she was chosen when there's no shortage of good Korean actresses. Over the top acting, screeching voice, condescending tone, with weak back story not enough to justify her behavior.Four stars for how meh this show is but I'll add two extra stars because it's still better than watching Hollywood garbage loaded with stewpid propaganda.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"As someone who saw the anime almost a decade ago, which was an adaptation of a manga by the same name, I was very curious how this story could possibly be adapted into live action without looking very silly (see the Japanese live adaptation films).Without spoiling anything, The Grey is not another live-adaptation of the manga, nor is it a sequel to it. It's more like a spin-off. The events that happen in Parasyte, in the original material, we only saw what happened in Japan. The Grey looks at what happens when the parasytes affects a different country. In this sense, you don't have to read the manga or watch the anime, as the TV series cover the worldbuilding fairly well.Now, the big question is, did it end up looking as silly as the films? No. I'd say the special effects in The Grey were awesome. Probably the best parts of the show. It will no doubt look a bit cartoonish still but I was very impressed. How much of it was practical effects? How much was it VFX? They have blended it very well.However, the shaky cam definitely didn't do the show any favours. Maybe it was a necessary evil to make the VFX looks as real as it did, but I rather have the camera stationary so we can focus on the fights, because some of the fights were pretty insane. But again, it might be because the cuts and shaky cams hid a lot of glaring issues and is why it was used.Still, Parasyte was and still is an interesting series just because it asks some interesting questions about humanity, survival, and morality. I don't think the philosophy was as in-depth as the manga or anime, given there were only 6 episodes, but there is enough to ponder here and definitely makes me want to watch the anime again (highly recommended but also has its fair share of flaws). For those who knew the source material, the last couple minutes in this show was super cool to see.In summary, Parasyte has an interesting premise and the TV series did an excellent job adapting it as a live action. Slowly, I think Netflix is producing more and more quality live adaptations which had been known for a long time to be a joke (Cowboy Bebop and Death Note is still a joke but Alice in Wonderland and One Piece was very good).",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"This South Korean show is like a violent gangsters/police/military version of The Host (which also featured an alien turncoat). It's reasonably well-acted and paced. I like the characters, although some are under-developed. The premise is ridiculous but sufficiently interesting to hold one's attention (the high-quality CGI helps). The ending is appropriate and satisfying.For those who haven't seen the anime (and gotten certain expectations), this show is fine -- if you don't think about it too much, and just enjoy the ride. There are some memorable scenes.There are plenty of technical/plot/logic flaws (as some reviewers have noted). Just one of these small parasites can devour your brain in seconds and then control your body in frightening ways. This film makes John Carpenter's THE THING look entirely plausible by comparison.I give this eight stars, with a one-star penalty for lack-of-plausibility (see the negative reviews for details).

As a live action it excels (better than the live actions for my taste), also the animation is quite good when depicting the parasites. Regarding the plot it keeps you engaged every episode. While it is not a remake of the original story it remains in essence like the original manga and anime (unlike other recent anime/cartoon adaptations of netflix). I hope netflix keeps this level of good work. The 8 out of ten is because there was some cringy moments here and there but thats expected on korean series.For people who hasn't seen the original material Ill recommend to check that first as this is basically a well made spin-off.

Maybe there will be more interesting plots in Season 2 hopefully.Spoiler alert....
BTW, I think it's plot hole what the Grey leader lady always use her cut-off ear. She showed that her ear was gone by her infected husband.To me it makes no sense why half transformed head with one blade of Su-in can win all the full transformed head with 2 blades. This was explained by the infected woman, the sister of Kan-woo. Still it make no sense for me though. The speed of all the infected guys look the same for me.

I just finished the last episode and if I could, I'd rate 11/10. Don't want to give any spoilers but it just made the show THAT much better. There was also a part where Heidi tried to get in the car quickly to get away and the actress nailed it!! I even laughed because it was subtle but so good.

In the newly series it fight so well right away at the get go, as the script writer don't bother to any character development.Storyline is so poorly scripted. At one point the main male broke into the so dangerous parasyte warehouse for no reason. The next he performs some heroic rescue to the main girl. And then suddenly he wants to quit, before his best friend got killed. And that killer parasyte suddenly becomes so intellectual and start being friend of human, just because she got betrayed. The acting of the grey team boss is so inconsistent too, when she first appears acting crazy but when the story goes on she becomes normal as hell.No to mention the main setting of parasyte in the hand is 100 times better than parasyte in the head.Overall I don't get why any fan of the original would accept this.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

The action was good and understandable with a good flow, there is no dawdling on insignificant matters. The ending is a surprise and you might need to read into who is introduced and what significance they have to the universe.Needs to have more story and something of actual importance or value happen in season 2 to not ruin it.

The great storyline is COMPLETELY moved forward by plot devices.A person with a two minute head start in a car, yet the pursuers are right behind them in ten seconds.In just one episode alone, people coincidentally ran into each other at the exact right moment 11 times, in a city that has 1.5 million people. That is like people knowing each other and running into each other 11 times in Phoenix, San Antonio or Philadelphia, without the use of GPS and totally by accident.No security anywhere...none. People are walking right up to police sergeant's desks and rummaging through them with no one noticing.The main characters, police, bad guys & bystanders all make the most insane non-rational decision almost 80% of the time. You are chasing a villain that has killed multiple policemen with guns....and one episode later you say..'Let's split up'.In another fight, let's go in without any weapons at all, after seeing a bunch of your colleagues die when they had weapons.

This keeps the number of infected humans down, and we see no mass extinction.The story picks up when a supermarket clerk is nearly murdered by a psychopath, right before being possessed herself. Due to her injuries, the parasite was unable to fully take over her body, and they live a symbiotic relationship.It's unfortunate that with all this potential, it fails to execute on multiple levels. The dialogue is extremely cheesy and unnecessary. The parasitic creatures get to change their own rules, especially when one arbitrarily changes bodies, when it was implied that it couldn't happen.There is absolutely no character development in the show.

It's a true masterpiece, compelling story, amazing actors, the best effects ever seen, yes on a higher level than DC Universe. It gives a new angle on the typical stories you would see in the Horror Thriller genre. So I was very surprised to see the plot changes throughout the episodes.

It's based on a Japanese manga and has been adapted into a South Korean series that stands out for its storytelling and visual effects. The lead character's symbiotic relationship with her parasite adds an intriguing layer to the plot, reminiscent of other works like ""Venom"" but with its own distinctive twist.The show has been well-received for its ability to maintain suspense and provide a satisfying conclusion to the season, leaving viewers eager for more. It's a testament to the creativity and potential of South Korean television production. However, some reviews suggest that while the action and visuals are impressive, there might be room for deeper exploration of the themes presented.Overall, the series seems to have struck a chord with audiences and critics alike, offering a compelling viewing experience that combines horror, science fiction and drama in a way that keeps you hooked till the end.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"This is a very good show, with a commendable adaptation. The VFX and animation are impressive, and the storyline, along with the acting and cinematography, is solid. However, it's worth noting that the story differs significantly from 'Parasyte: The Maxim.' As a fan of the original, I found 'The Grey' to have a distinct flavor, but by the end of the series, it becomes clear why it took this direction. The characters are really well-crafted and serve their purpose effectively. While there are some similarities between 'The Maxim' and 'The Grey,' the latter definitely shows a lot of potential to become a great show. The ending strongly suggests that there will be a second season, especially considering the show's strong viewership numbers. It's still trending in the top 10 in my country, so I have high hopes that it will continue, and let's hope season 2 will be as good as or even better than season 1.

tt21874396,What a total waste!This short series HAD potential but was utterly trashed by horrendous writing.Flow of events ridiculously nonsensical. Inconsistencies are glaringly everywhere. The whole thing is just an idiotic mess.Characters both human and parasytes make obvious illogical moves or non-moves over and over just to drag out more nonsense. Dialogue is poorly constructed and silly.The main nonsense apart from so many others is there is no solid reason (except for a weak stupid excuse that has no basis whatsoever) why the half-parasyte need or want to aid humans other than the director wanting to force in without any rhyme or reason a 'sympathetic' character - which is just laughable.The narrative keep pushing the fact that the parasytes ultimate aim is to survive. And they could all survive half-human or not. Why the meaningless conflict with that half-human???The two Japanese movies some years ago were much much superior to this junk plotting.,negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

tt21874396,"You know when this started I had lots of doubts and worries because Live action Anime Adaptations usually suck and they usually are terribly produced, But watching 2 Episodes in so far.. or well 1 n half actually lol and I thought this is such an insane Anime adapted series is so Good!! So when I found this series I thought aww damnit its in Korean.. n produced by koreans.. nothing against them and all but its a Japanese anime so you kinda wonder how could they do it justice really???????? I dont think I have ever seen a film or show that adapted it from another country and did it this impressively and quite frankly I dont think the Japanese could have done it as good as these Koreans have. Korean films n drama have been renowned in the last 10 years with Kpop also becoming a huge worldwide thing, Korean cinema has been impressively improving many folds every year that its become probably ranked top 3 worldwide in quality & fandom after American Hollywood & than United Kingdom British stuff, so I would have not doubted the Koreans ability at all if it wasnt for the series being about an anime.So anyway the graphics are amazing!! Its so crisp and clear & it can honestly match Hollywood in how realistic it looks when the aliens show themselves and fight. Japanese Live anime adaptations usually are a hit or miss in where they either have good acting n bad graphics quality or vice versa, But this Korean one has great acting and great quality CGI/VFX. I Read some online reviews knocking their graphics on looking fake or bad and I thought these websites are out kf their minds!? Its like have they even seen much Live Anime adaptations? For these ppl to act as if this is some C grade Hollywod movies... its ridiculous!! Sure its not quality like Transformers films or James Cameron Avatar film or Star Wars films but why would anyone even compare it to them? Those are all insane high budget films and this Parasyte Grey is a Tv series.Some other complaints I read from people were about the pacing being to slow, they expected much more monster battles per episode without even understanding the simple fact its a Tv series ppl! They can't give you movie quality lengthy battles lol. I just think ppl tend to forget this is not a hollywood series so maybe these ppl are unfamiliar with how asian series tend to be or specifically Korean ones possibly? I think some people were also dissapointedthat the main anime character is not the lead character in this series and thats okay really cause in the Anime and now this live action series they tell you that the aliens appeared all over the world so whatever happens in the Anime is somewhere else, while this series plot is in Korea, their is no contradiction at all and you could consider it as an expansion side story to the anime if u like cuz I know many ppl for sure have at one point wondered ""How everyone else is doing in the world vs this threat?"" and now we got our answer! Maybe next time they do an American one lol. If I was to add a complaint it would be the main character, I feel like she is written to be.. to quiet?? To timid?? I just feel most ppl in her position would be more frantic in personality or lively I guess? The male lead is good though, as well the head female unit leader she adds some nice flavours to the series with her... I guess.. wild side sometimes? Or maybe wrong choice of words.. shes like kooky sometimes mid sentence as if shes got The Joker inside of her waiting to burst out at anytime in the middle of speaking a sentence lol or maybe Ingot her all wrong ? Anyway the old male cop its too early to pass judgement yet but he seems okay.Now to continue watching and return to report back n edit my review if any changes are needed, Enjoy the series everyone ^_^",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

But the anime and this show merge together somehow. So clearly they will be making more which is great because this is an amazing series. However like all police or military dramas it has flaws. I mean it's cool to show you shots and it makes things more intense. But for example the music festival when she shot randomly at the cars that would not happen. Police especially task force police are trained extremely well and would never shoot randomly. Plus the city or county would be liable for any damages and injuries. Bringing me to my next point if this was to actually happen the military would have taken over instantly. Actually if this really happened The USA would have taken over 100% and many world militaries are interchangeable with the US military. Well or they are able to be used and taken over. So if this happened you would have the US military involved and I wish they included this as it was a global event. Thus a global task force would be working to take this parasite out.

The tragedies depicted in this series about the true human cost are quite moving. There is plenty of character growth as well, and there are debates around individuality versus collective objectives of existence.The series leaves you guessing about identity, with twists and turns at every junction.

Every episode got me hooked that I finished this series in one day.So, why did I gave this series a 9/10? As much as I love this storyline, it's always corny how some lead characters tend to make stupid decisions. Just like how one of the male leads decided to explore the parasyte's headquarters alone and nearly died. Furthermore, the woman leading The Grey team is way too hard headed that she became an unpleasant character with her own stance. Sure, you wanna defend humans more. But, with all these evidence why don't you trust Su-in for once? I feel the director wanted to stretch this persona until the very end of the story.The open ending scene to this series made me smile so hard. Firstly, the moment the male turned I was shocked to see my favorite Japanese actor, Suda. Then, my jaw dropped when he mentioned Shinichi Izumi. The last part where they zoomed into his right hand was top-notch. It was so good that I had to replay that scene a hundred times. This 10 seconds scene stole the whole show and a treat to the original anime fans.In conclusion, this series is worth the watch as it only contains 6 episodes.

tt21874396,"Parasyte: The Grey is a captivating South Korean adaptation of the highly acclaimed manga and anime series ""Parasyte"" (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu) by Hitoshi Iwaaki. This Netflix series takes the core essence of the original story-a world where alien parasites invade human bodies, causing a crisis of identity and survival-and transposes it into a new cultural and narrative context. This review delves into various aspects of the series, including its plot, characters, themes, visual aesthetics, and overall execution.Plot and PacingThe plot of Parasyte: The Grey follows the unsettling invasion of Earth by mysterious alien parasites. These entities burrow into human brains, taking control of their hosts' bodies, often resulting in horrific transformations. The central character, Jeon Sang-woo, a high school student, becomes partially infected by a parasite that fails to fully assimilate him. This creates a unique symbiosis where Jeon retains his consciousness and personality while gaining some of the parasite's abilities.The series is well-paced, balancing moments of intense action with slower, more reflective scenes that explore the psychological and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters. Unlike many action-heavy series, ""Parasyte: The Grey"" invests time in building its world and developing its characters, ensuring that viewers are not only entertained but also engaged on an intellectual level.*Characters and PerformancesJeon Sang-woo is a compelling protagonist, portrayed with depth and nuance. His internal struggle-navigating his new identity while retaining his humanity-is depicted with a relatable mix of fear, confusion, and resilience. The parasite within him, Migi, is a fascinating character in its own right. The dynamic between Jeon and Migi, blending tension and reluctant cooperation, is one of the series' highlights.Supporting characters, including Jeon's friends and family, as well as other parasitic hosts, add layers to the narrative. Each character brings their own perspectives and motivations, enriching the story. The performances are uniformly strong, with the actors successfully conveying the horror and existential dread that underpin the series.Themes and Philosophical UnderpinningsParasyte: The Grey delves into several profound themes, including identity, humanity, and the nature of existence. The parasites serve as a metaphor for various forms of intrusion and transformation, prompting viewers to question what it means to be human. The series also explores themes of survival and adaptation, both on an individual and species level.The ethical dilemmas faced by the characters-such as the morality of killing parasitic hosts who retain some semblance of their original selves-are thought-provoking. These themes are handled with a deft touch, never feeling heavy-handed or preachy. Instead, they naturally emerge from the narrative, encouraging viewers to engage with the material on a deeper level.Visual Aesthetics and EffectsVisually, Parasyte: The Grey is striking. The series effectively uses practical effects and CGI to bring the grotesque transformations of the parasites to life. The design of the parasites is faithful to the original manga, maintaining their unsettling and otherworldly appearance. The action sequences are well-choreographed, blending tension and horror with visceral impact.The cinematography is another strong point, utilizing a muted color palette to reflect the series' dark tone. The use of light and shadow enhances the sense of dread, creating a visually cohesive and immersive experience. The settings, from urban landscapes to more intimate, personal spaces, are meticulously crafted to support the narrative's mood.Sound and MusicThe sound design and music of Parasyte: The Grey play crucial roles in building the series' atmosphere. The soundtrack, composed of eerie and atmospheric pieces, heightens the tension and underscores the emotional beats of the story. Sound effects, particularly those associated with the parasites, are disturbingly effective, adding to the horror elements.Cultural AdaptationOne of the intriguing aspects of Parasyte: The Grey is how it adapts the original Japanese story to a South Korean context. The series retains the core themes and narrative structure of ""Parasyte"" while infusing it with cultural nuances that resonate with Korean viewers. This adaptation respects the source material while offering something new, making it accessible to a broader audience.Parasyte: The Grey is a standout adaptation that successfully blends horror, action, and philosophical inquiry. It stays true to the spirit of the original manga while carving out its own identity. The series excels in character development, thematic depth, and visual storytelling, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre. Whether you are familiar with the original ""Parasyte"" or new to the story, Parasyte: The Grey offers a gripping and thought-provoking experience that lingers long after the final episode.This series not only reaffirms the enduring appeal of Hitoshi Iwaaki's creation but also showcases the potential for cross-cultural adaptations to breathe new life into beloved stories.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Surprisingly good Korean, live action adaption of Japanese manga and anime Parasyte. Also proof that an adaptation can take an original story approach and still remain true to the original source material. But perhaps most surprising, and my favorite part of P:TG is the characters. By and large, all characters are likable, interesting. Importantly, these characters are ones the viewer wants to grow, develop and succeed.Who would like this? I'd say fans of TV shows like the Strain, Helix - movies like the Resident Evil franchise and all the adaptations of Body Snatchers. It's been a while since a good version of the Body Snatchers. Parasyte: the Grey takes itself Very seriously, and helps if the viewer can suspend disbelief and immerse themselves into the experience.Essentially this show follows two main characters Su-In and Kang-Woo. Both are basically ordinary people living in South Korea. The story belongs to female lead Su-In who works as a grocery clerk, but is revealed that her life has been one with traumatic misfortune going back to childhood. Kang-Woo is a low level gangster who finds himself a pawn of his own organization. Their lives are both upended by the introduction of a radical environmental element - parasite eggs falling from the sky that seek out a human host to possess. More characters are introduced including law enforcement and possessed humans, the parasite enemies.Most the character development involves the two main characters who both change radically from the first episode to the last. Su-In is literally changed into a new entity, and Kang-Woo has to face inner demons for abandoning family to become a criminal. To stress my favorite part of P:TG, following the characters journeys is entertaining and satisfying.I really enjoyed the performances, especially of the lead Su-In. She plays two characters who are quite different, which speaks to good pre-production work and direction on set. Anyone who has watch AAA South Korean TV shows will have an idea of what to expect in terms of production quality.Like the best genre work, P:TG asks interesting questions about the human condition. A big reason for this is the reflected humanity in possessed humans. Their clumsy and robotic social interactions are a great counterpoint for how we go about our daily lives. The parasite entities are individually very powerful, but can be defeated via human team work via our social structures/institutions.There's also an ax grinding ecological quality to the show revealed in the first episodes introduction, but luckily that thread is not stressed or focused upon. It feels more like foreshadowing for future content if this TV show has a few seasons and is allowed to mature.Effects are very good. Action scenes are horrific and an excellent part of the show. There is a lot of content that could descend into stark pessimism/nihilism, but it never does! Heroism and optimism are two stressed qualities throughout the arc. A lot of this stems from honoring those lost, which is a profound message.Truly, an excellent first season. While the first season arc is complete, the last episode does end on a minor cliff hanger which will likely serve as the takeoff point for the 2nd season. Recommended for fans of horror genre, and maybe for someone who wants to go outside of their general comfort zone.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Like most people, I associate South Korean media with dark and depressing tales about the depravity of mankind and the inherent cruelty of the human condition (as you can probably tell, I don't watch a lot of K dramas).So, colour me surprised that Parasyte: The Grey is not only as action packed and gory as a show (apparently based on a manga, which tracks) about head replacing alien parasites who can transform into all manner of bladed weapons would be, but it also has a lot...heart.First off, the show has some truly excellent action scenes. I don't know why, but East Asian media seems to capture what live action ""anime"" should look like in a way American and Western media more generally just can't. The action is fluid, fast, and a bit incredulous, but doesn't cross into the uncanny valley quite as much as you'd think.Parasyte in many ways reminds me of how action films USED to be; without all of the moral, self-deprecating baggage we expect from contemporary media.I liked that the government agency tasked with hunting the parasites is competent and rational, and the people involved generally make good decisions. Choi Jun-Kyung (played by Lee Jung-hyun) is a fantastic, classic action movie protagonist; she's not only capable and confident, but willing to entertain other ideas and perspectives. In a sense, the show reminds us WHY good leadership matters, with leadership being a running theme throughout the series.Jeon Su-in (Jeon So-nee) and Seol Kang-Woo (Koo Kyo-Hwan) are the emotional heart of the show; Su-in's character gives the show opportunities to ruminate on what it means to be human and the give us greater insights into the parasites, their survival strategy, and perspective on life. It's nice to see a show for once acknowledge that hey, humans have done a lot of impressive things with nothing more than our brains and capacity to organize. It's worth admiring.I also liked that the parasites weren't these uber competent beings tha the humans had no hope in defeating. I mean, realistically, they're organisms that cannot exist without hosts and have very rudimentary goals and needs. They don't have culture or art or techology; they are, for lack of a better term, DUMBER than people are. That they act somewhat like animals and show a complete lack of understanding of humanity, learning about us on the go, not only makes sense but is again, REFRESHING.I don't know how much of this is from the manga, but it makes me want to go back and read it.The show isn't entirely perfect; the CG can look a bit wonky and there is a price to pay with the earnest simplicity the show offers. I think certain things wrap up a bit too conveniently and the show doesn't really offer much in the way of a compelling hook for what comes next. But overall, if you like sci-fi action and aren't put off by body horror, I highly recommend this one.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

The monsters were also very boring .A parasitic monster enters a human . It eats the human's brain. Then it cuts cut off the human's head . It grows a new head and takes over the human's body and pretends to be that person . Sometimes the monsters kill humans for food , as that's all they can eat . It is very 'matter of factly' portrayed . So as they were going down that road , they should have used the analogy that humans kill animals for food too . It would have been somewhat logical and fit into their general concept.( NB . They did tried to make it gruesome by showing human body parts and deceased humans in plastic coverings but it lacked substance contradicted their entire theme)There is a government secret organisation who deal with the monsters . The organisation is called The Grey . They are independent of the police .After incidents regarding the monsters rise , the active head of The Grey , Choi Jung ,holds a conference whereby she tells the police about the existence of monsters and recruits their help.The actress who plays Choi Jung ,over plays her role.

They don't smile , frown , get annoyed, laugh etc . They are robotic like. They speak in a monotone voice of a robot ( like in films made in the 70s) . YET NO-ONE NOTICES THAT ! They all believe it's the real person ! Lol!2) Choi Jung is THE expert regarding monsters .When the main detective who she always talks to becomes a monster she doesn't notice either ! He talks in a monotone robotic voice, has no expressions and yet she doesn't notice!It's ridiculous ! Her character is incredibly stupid! . (The actress is terrible in role too . Awful actress!)3);There is a major incident with monsters killing humans . The policeman Cheol Ming wants to follow his friend Jeong Su-In who is in a truck ,as she is in danger . He knows his fellow colleague is working for the monsters yet he lets him get in his car and even lets him drive . Then Cheol Ming is surprised when his colleague takes him to another destination off track . His colleague asks him to join him by working for the monsters as the money is good .Instead of pretending that he will so that he can get out of a dangerous situation he shouts at his colleague and says he'd never do that . Cheong Min knows that his pistol will not kill a monster but when the Pastor who is the leader of the monsters shows up he shoots him. The body that the Pastor is using is destroyed but the monster isn't . So the monster cuts off Cheol Min's head and gets into his body and grows a new head. So the monster becomes Cheong Min4) One of the prominent female monsters is very vicious and hunts and kills humans. Suddenly without any logical explanation she starts helping humans .She mumbles some nonsensical garbage which I presume is meant to be her reason . These parasitic Monsters are not capable of having any kind of emotion. They merely exist . So why would she start helping humans!5) The physical apprarance of the monsters is not original . It's been done many times before.The monster gets these long tentacles like that of an octopus, growing out of its head , which it uses to attack people . The way it moves when attacking people is laughable . The movement is like when a woman who has long hair, moves her head fast from side to side. Her hair would have a momentum and say there was a light ornament as she was doing that, she'd knock the ornament of its pedestal with her hair . It's the same kind of movement the monster uses . Actually they could have used that movement to their advantage by having rock music in the background .That would have been cool and amusing .The positives of this series :
The female lead character Jeong Su-In, is believable and a plus in the series..The actress is good at her role. The main lead character Seol Kang is brilliant . His acting is fantastic ! The men who play cops are good too. The CGI effects were okay .",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"They've done a great job adapting the story to live action without stepping on the toes of the Anime.Rather than take a stab at adapting the anime 1:1 (which always ends up falling short), they take the smart approach of dealing with the Parasites that fell in other areas (Korea) and run with the story there. By doing so, they dont run the risk of upsetting folks by not matching everything, while also simultaneously expanding the universe they've built.I will say, though, that the show writers seem to have expected you to have watched the Anime -- which is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing in that they are able to gloss over a lot of the ""cumbersome"" dialog from the Anime assuming you know some of the details (which also helps when things happen and you ""get it"" without overbearing exposition). The curse being that it adds a slight barrier of entry to the show, as a first time watcher with no exposure to the Anime may have questions that go ""unanswered"".That being said, if you liked the anime you will like this show.

It explores the laws of life on the earth, whether it is humans or parasitic beasts, how the two species survive has nothing to do with the earth, it is the law between the organisms themselves, you can survive the fittest, you can coexist peacefully, or maintain some kind of balance under the unwarranted dividing line.But for the Earth, it has remained the same for millions of years, and it has not changed a single bit.This is the ultimate proposition of Shinichi's thinking at the end of the comic, in addition to reverence for life itself, but also for the creator of nature, the earth.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

I have been IN LOVE with Korean cinema and tv since I first saw the movie ""Friend"" more than 20 years ago.As you may have guessed, I'm also a huge fan of anime. Now, the original ""Parasyte"" anime was not bad. It was a fun animated series. It didn't hold a candle to this. The characters are well though - out. The plot has enough twists to keep even someone like me guessing as to what's going to happen next (which I love). You don't even know when someone is going to be killed off (or how suddenly). And the production values -- come on, they're Korean production values. The production values are SO over the top. Why do you think this has ten solid stars?The entire cast is excellent. The acting is very natural. Jeon So-nee plays the shy, introverted, humble, brave and beautiful and vulnerable orphan, Su-in. This is the first time that I've seen Jeon So-nee in a production but she's won me over so far in the four episodes that I've watched with my son. I'm familiar with the actor playing the secondary protagonist, Koo Kyo-hwan. I've seen him in ""Peninsula,"" ""Kingdom: Ashin of the North"" and ""Kill Boksoon."" He's great.

To make it more understandable, they even made the sheriffe as a used-to-be helpless housewife who lost loved ones due to the monster. Mind games are mostly carried out by the mosnters which made human-being just like purely preys, both physcially and mentally. Unlike the original anime where human-being are smarter than the mosnters only physically weaker to them. These monsters are supposed to be strong animals and weak on minds. They learnt from human to be like human and to prey on them. In this series human are just preys or victims of the monsters.

Whether it's parasites learning more about their being or human characters trying to understand and fight against this new threat, you are in for a layered, multi-perspective story with some great twists, character depth, and story development. Those long-term fans of the Parasyte franchise will also appreciate the similarities between Jeong Su-In and Shinichi Izumi in their symbiotic relationship with their parasites. There's also a great character arc for gangster turned fighter Seol Kang-Woo that needs to be seen.True to Korean horror, the visuals here are on a whole other level. Tight-knit fight choreography, frantic and violent carnage, and an adherence to polished flair throughout combo for some fantastic scenes. The CGI is especially great too, as is the cinematography. There's a mix of action aesthetic to the sci-fi horror and it works quite brilliantly in the overall look..... The acting, especially by the cast that have to perform as either parasite or human, is especially skillful. They transform into their roles. You can see how seriously everyone takes their roles and there are no bad performances here..... The soundtrack is also quite suspenseful, with a few bits that lean especially heavily towards more tense fare. There's also especially strong detail in the sound effects, especially with the way the parasites sound when they're fighting.Whether you're a fan of the Parasyte series or you're a newcomer, you'll definitely enjoy Parasyte: The Grey.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

The Puppet Masters film (1994) is less well known though. Parasitical alien creatures rain down on South Korea (and presumably elsewhere) taking over human hosts by wriggling in through ears.

One woman is altrady seriously injured when she encounters the parasite and forms a mutant with both personas surviving.

tt21874396,"Positives:
The concept is good. Although the first episode is long, it didn't feel too slow or boring.The lead character, the actress, is likable and makes you want to root for her survival.Negatives:
The episodes are 45 minutes or longer, with the first episode lasting 1 hour.Other than the lead character, there wasn't any character that I liked that much.I thought it would be as cool and amazing as ""All of Us Are Dead,"" but it's not that engaging.The way they were talking about the parasite in the ending meeting of the first episode, the man who became a parasite at the start, and no one except the lead character reacted before it starts attacking, the parasite writing in the diary ( I mean really?), these things looked like a joke or lazy writing.After almost every few minutes, a new lead or side character is introduced, which could confuse the viewer.There are not even a few characters to root for, no romantic tension, no good action scenes, and the first episode didn't even end with a cliffhanger or something.Overall, the first episode was average but for someone who hasn't watched many shows may even like this episode, to me, it was 2.25/5. Just because there are only 6 episodes and the lead character is likeable, I might complete it someday.

tt21874396,"When I saw that a Korean version of Parasyte was about to be released, I was both excited (because I really liked the story and concept of the manga) and afraid of the final result, as it is a short episodes Netflix production, and Netflix Korea messed up the previous series I was really looking forward to (Sweet Home part 2).Honestly, if you don't know much about the original story (either from the manga or the 2 parts movie) and don't really expect much in terms of quality work, this will be just fine for you.But as for me, I started watching Korean series because they were so good at taking their time to set up characters, background stories and atmospheres, and not aiming for a second season (meaning, just making a single season series and taking their time to tell a story from the beginning till the end). The original Parasyte was great, because it was questioning our place as humans, and what makes people humans (plus maternity, friendship and other stuff).This one... is just a typical Netflix series: some fun moments and visuals, some entertainement, but you just forget about it a month later.As for the series quality, the CGI aren't that good, they look somewhat cheap (this reminded me of Connect, another cheap Disney+ Korean series), the characters and story aren't that compelling, and the short format (6 episodes) isn't fit for korean series. Well, maybe they'll do just the same as they did with Sweet home, releasing a second season many years after, with a huge time lapse and characters change right in the middle of the season...Before thinking that this is a piece of art, just read the manga and watch the movies. You'll then realise that this is just a cheap rip-off.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

Let's make the guy a girl, let's make the alien take over half of her brain instead of her hand, lets completely ruin the original story for no reason whatsoever. Just a complete waste of time.

tt21874396,"""The Parasite Grey"" TV series, despite its intriguing premise, suffers from a lack of originality and a meandering plotline, leading many viewers to label it as a derivative work that bears striking similarities to the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. The series attempts to explore a post-apocalyptic world overrun by parasitic organisms that transform humans into grotesque and violent creatures. However, the story arc follows a formulaic path, recycling familiar tropes without injecting fresh ideas or character development. The show heavily relies on action sequences and special effects to maintain viewer interest, yet it ultimately falls flat due to its uninspired narrative and predictable twists.One of the redeeming qualities of ""The Parasite Grey"" is its cast, who deliver commendable performances despite the lackluster script. The actors bring depth to their roles, portraying a range of emotions that hint at the personal struggles and relationships within this bleak world. Their efforts to breathe life into the otherwise one-dimensional characters are commendable, but even strong acting can't salvage a plot that seems to be on autopilot. The interactions between characters are occasionally compelling, suggesting that with better writing, the show could have been more engaging and nuanced.The show's CGI and special effects are visually impressive, contributing to the sense of chaos and horror in this dystopian landscape. The scenes involving the parasitic creatures are rendered with meticulous detail, creating a convincing atmosphere of tension and danger. The production team clearly invested in high-quality visual effects, and this aspect of the series generally receives positive feedback from viewers. Unfortunately, the glossy appearance of the CGI cannot make up for the series' lack of substance, and it's not enough to elevate the overall viewing experience.Despite these technical achievements, ""The Parasite Grey"" suffers from a dull story that lacks the suspense and complexity necessary to keep audiences engaged. The plot tends to follow a predictable trajectory, with little innovation in terms of character arcs or narrative structure. The show often feels like it's going through the motions, with repetitive scenarios and an overreliance on action sequences to drive the story forward. There are few, if any, meaningful surprises or revelations, leaving viewers with a sense of monotony rather than anticipation for what's next.Overall, ""The Parasite Grey"" presents a mixed bag of quality acting and impressive CGI overshadowed by a dull and uninspired story. While the series may appeal to those who enjoy post-apocalyptic themes and high-octane action, its lack of originality and engagement may turn off viewers seeking a more compelling narrative. The show often feels like a missed opportunity, failing to capitalize on the potential for character development and deeper storytelling within its setting. The result is a series that, despite its strong production values, ultimately comes across as a boring and uninspired rehash of familiar ideas.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Not long ago, I rewatched the anime and even now, it remain as true gem. Parasyte the Grey (Gisaengsu: Deo geurei) does not pay tribute to the series, only tries do to better and fails imensevely, that was my first introduction to the ""dorama"" catagory and I was surprised it is so shalow; the dialogs seem to have been made by I. A. and do not represent the original source, and the CGI is just bad, it's like and reimaged of Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu in other universe not in the same timeline. They placed Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu lore in Parasyste the Grey, but charactazation it's not there, Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu it's not good because the history is about parasytes in human bodies, but the deep characters that are in the show that makes the anime so good even nowdays. The biggest flaw in Parasyte the Grey has to be the parasyte telling who it is to a random stranger for no good reason. I mean if you are a parasyste and need to hide yourself, you don't tell anyone; you can tell to your host because that host will know eventually, but telling who you are to a random stranger can put you at risk and make your survival at risk, that was the whole point in the anime made by Mig in Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu why any parasyste reveal themselves to anyone other their kin, if they do to a human, why let the human live? If that information can put your wellbeing at risk, you as a parasite have to kill anyone who knows you are a parasite.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

Romero, who once said that Horror was a way for him to make a social statement and guess this series somehow delivers that in a great way (in one episode there's a strange- and quite actual- discussion on what to do with the bodies of working and high society people). There's also the long and neverending question between slow and fast zombies. After Train to Busan we got a peek to what South Korea seems to prefer, and I'm glad with this, but if you add the fact that these zombies share also some similarities with vampires (the fact that they're scared/damaged by light) it just climb up to other levels of awesomeness. I would like to say that what most attracted me to this series is the fact that the zombie Genre had long been quite unexploited and Kingdom is a rare gem because not only it's an era drama/horror series but also all the things I've stated before.

tt6611916,"As my title suggested I am amazed at the successful combination of different genres so to speak. It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the ""subtle"" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning!

tt6611916,"I just finished binge-watching Kingdom. I'll now explain my headline lol. Here is my review. The story takes place during Korea's medieval Joseon period amongst a mysterious plague. The shows pacing is perfect. The acting is impeccable and all the actors and actresses did incredible. The action was absolutely epic af. No exaggeration. Blood and Gore galore. The battles are the Koreans version of GOT. Korean anything in cinema is my absolute favorite. I feel like they reinvent the wheel constantly for outdoing their previous entries all the time and that ""us"" as American Filmmakers can learn a thing or two from them. The money they invested into this show definitely shows with each episode costing a tad more than 1.78 million dollars. The cinematography is to die for literally lol. The shots in both the action scenes and dramatic yet everyday scenes that were filmed are superb. The tension of the shots is evident at every angle. If you never liked reading subtitles prior you need to fix that crap immediately because this show is so worth it. I hope and pray that they make a season two because as it stands this is my favorite show of 2019 and it's only January and this will undoubtedly remain my new favorite show. Netflix was smart to invest in this show. Horror done right. The zombie design was magnificent in the most grotesque way possible lol. The few plot twists they had in season one were definitely unexpected to say the least.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"I was recommended to watch ""Kingdom"" by a friend, as he knew I love everything zombiesque, and somehow the South Korean horror drama ""Kingdom"" had managed to elude my radar.With ""Kingdom"" readily available on Netflix, I sat down and watched all 6 episodes of the first season in rapid succession. While ""Kingdom"" is no ""The Walking Dead"" in a South Korean interpretation, it is still a rather enjoyable TV series because of equal parts zombie action and storytelling.""Kingdom"" is somewhat hindered by a rather slow pacing, that while it definitely helps the movie and story, it just made me feel that it took the series forever to get up in gear and to become good. But the slow pace was necessary, I suppose, because it helped establish the character gallery quite well, while offering bits and pieces of adrenaline-filled segments to the audience of things to come.While ""Kingdom"" is not following the average (and generic) zombie formula, it is still a very enjoyable show and it is an interesting approach on a zombie outbreak. One thing that I am usually not enjoying is agile, fast and running zombies, but it actually works quite well in ""Kingdom"" for some reason.This is a TV series where zombies are a part, yes, but it is not a TV series about the zombies. No, this is a drama about well-defined and nicely portrayed characters and their quests for survival, hunger for power, revenge, political plays and such.The TV series have a very nice ensemble of casted actors and actresses to portray to the various roles and characters in the show. I was definitely more than pleasantly surprised to see Doona Bae (playing Seo-bi) in the show, and she brings with her a lot of grace.The zombie make-up is adequate, and it serves its purpose quite well. As stated above, this is not a TV series about the zombies themselves, so it is not richly endowed with gross and ghastly special effects displaying gore and other such grim things that are often a major part in the zombie movies and TV series. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, naturally as a massive zombie fanatic I would like to see as much blood, guts and mayhem as possible, but the toned down brutality and gore of ""Kingdom"" actually suits the theme and atmosphere of the TV series quite well.The downside to ""Kingdom"" is the slow pacing of the story. While it was a mere 6 episodes running just short of an hour or so each, it felt much, much longer. But it is hardly a deterrence for me to shy away from season 2 if it should make its way to Netflix.""Kingdom"" is definitely well worth watching if you are a fan of the zombie genre, and need something to fill the time in between other zombie shows.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

And some ridiculous characters who I assume are there for some sort of comedy value.One minute it's trying to be serious walking dead style horror, the next minute you have bumbling Laurel & Hardy type characters screaming like girls and falling about the place.As for the people giving it a 10 rating...if you consider this a perfect ten, holding it aloft with the Likes of Breaking Bad and the Wire you need your head examined.",negative,"Action, Drama, Horror"

I enjoyed this, don't get me wrong, but I was really expecting there to be higher stakes and significantly more tensions throughout. For a horror series, it was only until the final episode that I ever even got a good jump scare. I respect the use of actual extras to perform as the zombies, but holy crap--some of these extras are so silly in their body language/performance/movement that there is no hiding their human-ness regardless of how much makeup you put on them. Characters are very simply defined without much moral ambiguity, increasing the simplicity of the story.Will watch season 2, but this series is not yet ground-breaking beyond it's production value.",negative,"Action, Drama, Horror"

great displays of loyalty and revenge, along with espionage and evil doings.The fight scenes are plausable, not the typical Chinese martial arts over the top stuff, no one flying through the sky or running up walls.It is really one of the best zombie based shows I have ever seen, the movie is good too. I hate subtitled material, but I don't mind this at all, it is well worth it.

tt6611916,"Review of Season One:KINGDOM is the second top-notch zombie production to come from South Korean, following the film TRAIN TO BUSAN. This one's a six-part Netflix miniseries that explores a zombie outbreak during the Joseon dynasty. The series is a strong mix of GAME OF THRONES-style political intrigue and plotting with plenty of zombie action; the zombies themselves are fresh and frightening, thanks to some twists with the mythology and 28 DAYS LATER-style speed and ferocity. Netflix have really gone to town with the production values here and many of the visuals are good enough to make framed prints. The scenery and sets look luxurious and the costumes are brought to life in glorious colours. A small but distinctive cast, including Doona Bae, play characters with depth and humanity. In between the zombie attacks there's endless plotting, twisting and oodles of suspense, while the stand-out set-pieces in episodes three and four are among the best I've ever seen. Needless to say, I can't wait for season two...Review of Season TwoThe second season is a slight step down from a first, but only a slight. The zombies only really pose a threat in half of the episodes and for the rest the new focus is on political intrigue, which is present times ten. I found some of the plotting to be slightly over-elaborate; the whole issue of the queen and her child was already fully explained in the first series, but seems to take up a lot of space here. Plus I always find flashbacks to be a slightly lazy way to pad out the story; GAME OF THRONES and BOARDWALK EMPIRE suffered from them too. Otherwise, there are still great production values, strong performances and expert choreography to enjoy, and a left-field twist at the climax ably sets up a very differently toned third season.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"Set in Korea's Joseon Period when, shortly after the king is taken ill, a mysterious plague starts to threaten the nation. The remains of a doctor who had died shortly after treating the king were eaten by starving peasants and shortly after they became ravenous zombie-like creatures, attacking anybody they see, spreading the condition. Crown Prince Lee Chang, the King's illegitimate son, starts to investigate. Rumours spread that the king is in fact dead and that the Queen's family is waiting for her to give birth; hoping if she has a son he will be the next king not the Crown Prince. When the Crown Prince is declared a traitor the army is deployed to find him.If you are a fan of zombies but feel most films/series are just more of the same these days this is a must see. Those infected by the plague might not follow all the standard zombie rules but the way they move at speed and as a mass adds to their scariness. These beings also are apparently unable to go out in the sun and seek shelter at night; this leads to tension rising as dawn approaches. The setting adds to the feeling that this series is something new; not just a different country but also an historical period that provides different problems to our own, notably the rigid hierarchy and palace scheming. The combination of court politics with zombies might seem an unusual mix but they work to give a great story. Everything looks great with beautiful scenery contrasting with the brutality of the action. The cast is solid, most notably Ju Ji-hoon, as the Crown Prince; Bae Doona as Seo-bi, a physician researching the plague; Kim Sung-kyu as Yeong-shin, a mysterious tiger hunter; and Kim Sang-ho as Mu-yeong, the Prince's bodyguard. The main plot lines are nicely wrapped up after two seasons but new details leave things open for a third; I have no idea whether there will be more though. Overall I'd say this is definitely one to watch.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"It hasn't been a mystery that South-Koreans can make very good movies but now Kingdom shows that they can also make quality shows as well. Kingdom is only two short seasons long (plus an additional long episode that came out in 2021 called Ashin From The North) but it's addictive to watch. The cinematography is just on top, and the acting for Asian standards is certainly not bad. Okay you have the occasional overacting from a couple actors but overal it's all very well done. Like Sang-ho Yeon's Busanhaeng (Train To Busan) the zombies are just something different than the usual thing we're used to. South-Korean zombies don't wander around slowly looking for brains like in American movies. Here they run like they are the next Usain Bolt and that what makes it suspenseful. The make-up is all very convincing, credits to the make-up artists for that. I binge watched the two seasons in a couple days followed by the extra long episode from 2021 which explains a lot in the end. You don't necessarily have to watch the extra episode but it's of the same quality and certainly worth watching. Kindom is another example why I love South-Korean cinema. They are the best from all Asian countries and that by far.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"I have some issues with this, but overall I really like it - it just keeps moving. The short run length of 6 episode for the first series is a breath of fresh air after drawn out shows like the marvel ones and umbrella academy.This was obvious in the second episode when our ""heroes"" needed to find someone and they were in the Frozen Valley - as soon as I heard that, I was prepared for a long drawn out journey to said Frozen Valley - but no - they were there in the next scene! This is very jarring compared to a US show that can draw out any event over several years, so it was refreshing to see a plot move along at pace.On the downside, I don't like my zombies to only come out at night and move quickly - the scary thing about zombies is while one is easily despatched through decapitation, they just keep coming and you are overwhelmed by slow moving numbers.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"Netflix Kingdom is like a lot of Netflix shows.
It has huge production value, more so than most of Netflix shows.
The costume design, the practical effects and VFX for the zombies, all the details in Korean culture, the landscapes, the different colors et cetera. They all really feel like the show is taking you into that certain time.The first 6 episodes were also really good in action, when delivering so. Also the last episode had some really slithering tension and really great built up, leading to a cliff hanger. Don't really know what to think of that, but I'll take it for now.But it also falls for the same tropes of many Netflix original shows. First, it has some pacing issues. The 3 & 4th episode in particular feel practically only like retelling the second episode and in all these 3 episode the only thing happening is actually zombies killing people in villages. That leads to a dragging narrative for quite some time.The other flaw I had with it where the lacking characterization of many characters. While it looked gorgeous on the surface, the substance wasn't always there to back up. It certainly touched on themes like royalty, treason & honor, but it never gave its 3-4 characters at center much time to fully come to life.The acting & humor is very Asian-like, so you'd have to be prepared for some of these jokes, as the performances are very much like one would expect from a Korean production. But that's not really a flaw if you have your expectations.If you really don't care about much substance, or explained depth narrative than the show is absolutely perfect. It's zombie action, put into a unique setting, with unique ideas and themes.
I'm probably gonna check the second season out, so I'm curios what they are going to do after that cliffhanger.6-7/10",,"Action, Drama, Horror"

But by the 3rd episode the tone completely changed and it seemed like the show didn't take itself seriously anymore. I hated the bumbling buffoonery of some of the town leaders.

tt6611916,"When I started watching this series I didn't know a great deal about it. I expected to be a a Korean drama with zombies set in the past and lots of sword fighting. I was not disappointed. It was exactly what I expected and a little bit more.First of all, I like the mythology of zombies in this series as they remind me of the traditional image (not the Hollywood version) of another monster whose name starts with v.Then after the first zombies appear, the court intrigues peaked my interest more so than the walking dead. Which mean there are more layers to the story and the suspense comes not only from the survival point of view but also form the character motivations. Another good point is that every episode is edited to perfection, there is no dragging along, no fluff to fill the time. The series is focusing on telling a story.Visually, it's top-notch, beautiful scenery and terrifying zombies. I'm hesitant to say it's historically accurate (well, because of the zombies) but I shook my head when I heard people want a strong female character in a period drama, just for the sake of modern trends. The old Korean society had strict hierarchy and the role of women was strictly domestic. Let's not start a dispute about depiction of history.I have 2 negative opinions about the first season of the series (as of writing the only one). First, the way it ended. Huge cliffhanger. Not a big complaint as the second season will come out this year, too. Second, another part of the ending. It wants to be a twist but it's unrealistic. I know I'm talking about realism in a zombie movie again but everything up to the last episode was perfect. Perfect explanation for everything and no obvious plot holes. It's bugging me that two consecutive nights are so different from one another.If you want to enjoy it, just watch it and be surprised at the plot twist, don't try to use physics to verify the possibility of some stuff. It's an amazing series. Way better than Walking Dead.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"This drama makes very effective use of suspense and these zombies are not at all sluggish, slow-moving, or entirely brainless. The biological explanations for dead humans running and trying to eat living humans seems pretty plausible. The only thing lacking is intimacy in the series--you don't really get to know any of the characters intimately, there isn't much character development, and relationships don't really evovle and develop. But in terms of a plot-driven storyline this drama does a great job. Sometimes the shock effects seem gratuitious and uncessary especially after the viewer is introduced to the zombies and have a good idea of how they operate. Scenes where a character is being stalked and pounced by these zombies during the last few episodes seem a little pointless. Suspense is really only exiciting when the predator is unknown and not well-understood. Otherwise, we can pretty much predict what the monster will do.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

Just the way papa likes it. rofl. They added a really nice twist to zombies in this series as well. I'm a fan for adding your own ideas and flare to how a zombie should act, but I had one hell of a grin on my face when.......oh, I guess you should watch the season finale and see what I was going to say?!The 1 and 2 star reviews don't seem to be zombie fans.

tt6611916,"This new Netflix original Korean zombie series succeeds in surprising with its fast paced narration and a few unexpected twists in a beaten to death genre.
This show takes a new approach by setting the zombie drama in the backdrop of a period show.
The politics of the monarchy forms the content of the screenplay. For the most part the zombie and political part of the show remains seperate but converges as it reaches the culmination point.
The variety of zombie deaths, the types of kills and the adreneline pumping chases are nothing short of great. It didnt hinder the experience in any way.
The locations this was set in,the aerial views and the scenic beauty captured via the lens provides an immersive experience.
The background scoring was good enough to capture and produce the thrill, especially during the final episode.The tone is really dark in this show. Apart from the zombie elements, the treachery and vile of the characters and their actions to protect power is diabolical at the least.The show does seem to slow down in its pace during the middle but compensates with its heart racing finale.The mini plots during the showcase of zombie disease spreading is done well without holding back in its disturbing level.Ultimately, this show is not a complete one and it never intended to be one. It sets up everything for a high potential second season. While doing this, it manages to surprise the viewers during the last episode.This is a short pacy zombie period show which does not demand much of your attention and can be binged as a casual view.PS: If you are new to Korean drama, the antics, goofs and few mannerisms of the actors may seem over the top, but it is sort of unique to the korean culture and is seen in every Korean movie and drama.

What makes this show unique and possibly one of the best zombie shows I've ever seen is not just the superb acting, but the complexity of the show.

The cinematic experience is on a par with the best of Hollywood when needed, and the attention to detail in the palace's and costumes is second to none.
I used to watch the walking dead but the zombies became so slow and boring that I gave up on it. The zombies here are on a par with World War Z and then some, and just to make it more interesting they are also ever so slightly evolving through the show.

Talking about 'the walking dead', that show is almost completed 150 episodes and has maintained the rating 8.2 even after season 7,8 being lowest rated of the entire series, still it's going strong with it's latest season 9,10 being entertaining again. And this show has 8.3 rating after just 17K votes. If ratings don't matter to y'all then also stop bragging senseless talk. And the comparison with GOT is out of the world.

Then season 2 happened and it lost its magic. Well this is how I feel about kingdom. This show is amazing. I'm a huge South Korean cinema fan but I tend to stay away from their shows because they're usually just teen dramas but I heard this show was different and was planning on watching it but then I remembered how Netflix loved cancelling their originals so I held off on it. Now a few days away from the season 2 premier I decided to finally start watching this show and I watched all six episodes in one sitting.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIMEWhile season 1 was a great run, many are extremely disappointed with this highly anticipated sequel:
terribly slow pace, too much talkingfocused on political power struggle and drama with highly guessable plotswhere the fvck are the zombies????!!!!Looks like another TV series forced to finish deadlines in less than a year.

There is so much more to the story than the usual zombie attacks in every scene, with their endless bone cracking and growling noises. There were one or two scenes where I found the acting to be a bit overdone and cheesy, but season 2 is phenomenal! I really enjoyed the depth the characters have developed.

tt6611916,"This series is great although, the one negative is the English dubbing / translations. I am confident that the Korean version isn't as silly or infantile as the translations would have you believe. In fact, the story and acting are enough to help you overlook the Anglo-slaughter of the dubbed version. I liked Ju Ji-Hoon's performance so much I googled him to see what else he was in so I could check them out.The reason for 7/10 is because there are a few moments throughout the seasons where the characters would have to be willingly stupid in order to not draw a straight line between what they've learned and uncovering secrets. I don't think a person of average intelligence wouldn't clue in to some things that characters in the show seem baffled by; again, this could be simply the result of poor translation, but that's the experience I had so it was hard not to be influenced by it.All in all, I am hopeful for future seasons and to see what happens to the Kingdom going forward.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"""Kingdom"" is a well done series with characteristically Eastern production. The sets are well made, the scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack is compelling and the action is fierce. The acting, of course, is melodramatic as usual, but while fans of campy Chinese Kung Fu movies (yes, I know this is Korean) will not find anything unusual about grown men behaving like injured, hysterical children in response to any hint of tension, viewers unaccustomed to Eastern melodrama will be repulsed.

tt26628595,"Watched this from ""recommendations"" on my Prime. I was a skeptical at first, having no experience with the language or Korean dramas. It's funny, but after the first episode, you forget you're watching subtitles.This is incredibly well-written and well acted. It grabs your emotions and makes you invest in the characters. There's enough back story to explain things without it going off on to some uninteresting tangent. There is great chemistry between actors (not just the lead ones) and an amazing sense of anticipation. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, a twist comes in. Realistic twists, not some far-fetched thing to wrap up a side story.As soon as my phone pings, I'm on the tv to watch it full screen.

tt26628595,"So this kdrama is actually very dramatic and entertains throughout. Really loved the fl's character development and change in her personality as she slipped in her second life - it was super satisfying to watch. It's all fun until you see a lot of loose strings in the plot towards the end. Just to name a few points I didn't enjoy..1. Firstly I just didn't like the chemistry between the leads. Like don't want to shade the ml but he's just not good at acting. Where were his expressions excuse me? Nah they just didn't do it for me.2. Just don't understand why was the plot so non sensical after 12th ep. What's with all the murder scheming and stuff? And wtf was the point of pretending to get back with min hwang, like fr? So not needed. And Yoora and her actions were totally uncalled for.3. The writers did the second leads so bad like where was their screen time? They made such a cute pair. I really wanted to see them more instead of that crazy race of killing everyone.4. I know this is fiction and I have watched a lot of rich lead kdramas but still I always wonder do the characters have no real work to do? Like do they just scheme useless traps all day? Take yoora for example it just seemed like her full time job was to stalk ji won. Also how can you make a person hr head/ chairman's secretary/ lawyer at the same time lol. And even after that he has got time to dig everyone's dirt.Oh and did I mention I just couldn't take min hwang seriously the whole time?? Like it's not his fault it's just that I've seen him in welcome to waikiki before and I just can't seem to take him seriously ever again iykyk. The female casting was done perfectly - ji won, su min were all great choices and did a fabulous job.

a woman who witnesses the affair between her best friend and her husband, and is murdered by them, she goes back in time to change her future and seek revenge.This kdrama is also based on webtoon. (This has became new trend), but as per webtoon readers, makers have done some changes.You get invested in the drama from 1st scene.Story progresses with ample twists & turns, though we already know where it is heading.Casting of Park Min-young as FL and Lee Yi-kyung as main villain is perfect. Specially Lee Yi-kyung is not only good in his villainous acts but he was equally good in comedy scenes. Park Min-young does what she is famous for. Her acting is perfect.Na In-woo has wooden face but he is ok as lead as his only duty is to support FL. Good enough romantic scenes between leads.1st female villain, is good in dramatic scenes but she screamed a lot, which was annoying.In later episodes they bring another female vamp, which is not needed, she just increases the screen time.It's a soap opera type kdrama, good watch for kdrama lovers.Supporting cast is good.

tt26628595,"I've seen manhwa adoptions before (both with actors, as well as in animated form). Some better than others but when I stumbled over this one on my prime account, I dropped my viewing plans and cleared my schedule and watched the first 3 episodes (hours).I don't know if it's the score (music), the scrip (that looks like it holds hand in hand with its source (love that 👌) or if the actors, direction or lighting and stylist had a finger in making this magical. Perhaps all of the above because it just CLICKED for me. I got swept off into the story, it took me where I first went in the manhwa and I couldn't say any negatives about it,Sure, Su-min doesn't have her ""pink'ish"" hair, nor does a-hole of the year not his brown'ish hair but the actors ARE these characters. I have NO trouble believing them or notice who is who from a glance since the behavior (dirty or sweet) shines through everyone of the main cast.Deep respect for the actors here. Not sure if they read the manhwa and laughed, cried and raged at some characters and that's why they are so incredibly adjusted to just BE THEM! But everyone had me mimic their faces. I was so caught up in it! Sumin pouted and I wondered why my brows hurt: I was glaring at her while at the same time ""mirrored"" her pout because I was so deeply invested into it.When our heroine cried, feared or raged internally I ""felt"" all those emotions and was sobbing at several points, to the point that I had to apologize to the rest of the house that I just found a REALLY GOOD series, so that's why there is cheering, shouting and crying 😅Needless to say, I cannot speak highly enough for this.I know some will take issue with the lack of hair color on a few character, however I understand and have to respect the different culture of ""blending in"" rather than looking like a peacock in between shoots (or have horribly wigs that fans would perhaps also fault them for).",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The script its so similar to the original one. I've been screaming like a crazy, getting mad, crying. And my heart can't wait to see the next episodes each week. The story is very shocking, and you can easily get into Jiwoon's life, understand her, and get encouraged with her, hoping that she can recover the life that she could live once before, being happy, and be loved.

tt26628595,"I honestly had very little expectations for this, but it's surprisingly kept me interested so far. It's got comfortable pacing, nothing moves too fast or too slow. There is no dragging or overextending of emotional moments, it feels like everything is moving just right.At the same time, I have to say I really dislike the tendency of kdramas to ""justify"" the main couple by throwing in flashbacks of how they've actually met before. Marry my husband joins other very good and prominent dramas with this cardinal cringy sin, which I completely dislike. I think it even takes away from the plot.Otherwise, I really like and feel inspired by the storyline of having the second chance to do your life all over- and I really like that the main character does a full makeover physically and mentally. She questions her own past actions and decides she is going to fight for herself. She chooses to no longer be a pushover, and tries finding people who deserve her. I think it's really fitting to have this drama released in this day and age.I heard it's a webtoon adaptation- I don't really know much about the webtoon so I can't comment on how well it was adapted.

Besides from being socially responsible, in that it is not working to actively promote the patriarchy like so many other k-drama's, it's also very entertaining and for me thoroughly enjoyable.

It seems they are trying to drag the plot longer because the it was received well initially.The later writing really convinced me that the main character deserves to have a tragic life and die. It's all because of her terrible personality.Imagine someone gives up at the first sight of difficulty, refuse to listen to any explanation and deeply involved in her own beliefs and refuses to listen to any reasoning. Also makes audacious assumptions and don't even bother to prove if those assumptions are right or wrong. Hey I have an assumption and I'll just live by it. That's what her sounds like.It's horrible too watch at the later episodes.

tt26628595,I loved the webtoon so much so i was pretty excited when this released. But man I was disappointed. The lead actress seems timid and watered down version of what was actually the character of ji won. The lead protagonist is supposed to change after coming back from dead. But I see no oomph or pizzaz or badass attitude in her. Miscasting imo. For other characters i pretty much like them. This is just my opinion.

Ep 12 introduces the boss' ex, a vicious, ugly woman, who can't get over the fact she's not his ex-finace and of course, she plots lots of revenge. This character bored me to death, a waste of screen time. If your ex doesn't want you, what are you doing pursuing them, going behind their back doing these devious horrible things.

The positive and assertive action taken by FL definitely influenced all the good people around her, most especially the ML who is normally seen as boring, though he has all the money and power anyone will ever have.

Think moments of legend of the deep blue.This drama had me hating the characters including the leads at times, the, liking them, then frustrated. The fact it evoked so much emotion seriously means a lot. Like let me re-iterate that I struggle through most dramas these days. I found it refreshing and honestly love the actors, although I'd say the ""villains"" are much much weaker than the leads. I also don't think some people realize that Dramas are basically leveled up Soaps. Seriously there's always going to be cheesy, soapy moments mixed in. That's just the nature of it. Regardless, the acting and story line was good. I also chuckled at the way the leads found out the truth. A funny add in.Would I recommend this? Yes. I put it off after being recommended it by 2 friends and I should have watched sooner. Enjoy!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Korean Drama '' Marry My Husband '' is a fantasy melodrama with a romance to boot.The drama, first of all, has a strong start. The melodrama hits its peak then, with the villains being truly despicable, creating the right environment to cultivate a revenge plot hereby.The romance was also cute, especially since the main couple had loads of chemistry.On the other hand, the drama started getting messy, with idiotic twists, cheesy romantic scenes, and an ending that was rushed to conclude everyone's storyline.At least, the performances were all enjoyable.So, overall, six out of ten.....",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt26628595,"Infidelity is the core of a story that is both the root of the personal conflicts and an everpresent issue among the characters. The good men are for the most part expensive clothes models and helping hands, always nearby and using muscle as needed. Narrative is a little extended, there was that choking episode that seems to have been a filler and some slower paced plotting in the early episodes, that whole campground sequence was stretched. Actress playing Soo-min the antagonist has some over-the-top scenes. Ji-Hyeok is a bland idealized boyfriend. Ji-won the protoganist has the largest character arc going from a sickly mouse to a rich and strong executive, some interesting writing has her going out of her way to aggravate her opponents. Everybody gets their just due, the meek and mild have learned to be more assertive and successful, others have funerals or incarceration. Direction uses a little too much of the K-Drama rewind technique, showing an event then following up with how it happened afterwards. Some sci-fi time travel aspects are dealt with, certain events have to occur but not neccesarily to the same individuals. 16 episodes wind up with a happy ending as a second-chance at life tale.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The secondary characters were also incredibly well written and were lovely in their own way getting their own full thought out stories.

I've seen the 6 first episodes so far so I can only hope the quality of acting and realization will remain top notch with the next 10 episodes. I didn't read the webtoon and I'm happy to discover the story every week without any bias. The choice of PMY as MFL was a good idea. She shows fragility and strength beautifully.

tt26628595,"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2024 South Korean time travel, revenge romance with 16, 70 minute episodes.First I provide a unique synopsis then reviewSynopsisIn 2023 Kang Ji won (Park Min Young) is married to Park Min Hwan (Lee Yi Kyung) and is living a miserable life where she is emotionally abused by her husband his mother. Things worsen for her when she is diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. The one bright light in her life is her ""other half"", her childhood friend Jung Su min (Uhm Seo hyun). Or so she thinks. What remains of her life is completely shattered when she finds her husband and best friend in the midst of an affair. Even worse they are not remorseful and mock her poor condition. Things get physical between her and her husband and he winds up pushing her, in her weak state, into a glass table. As her life light dims, she hears her best friend and husband talking about life insurance and how she was just going to die anyway. She comes to finding herself having traveled back in time to before she married her murderous spouse (2013). Fate has given her the opportunity to change her life path and get revenge on those that wronged her. You want my husband? Well you can have him. She discovered she can change her fate by having key events transfer to someone else. And she cannot think of anyone who deserves her horrible husband more than her former best friend. Can Jiwon get revenge, change her fate and find love in the second chance?ReviewThis is an interesting and unique time travel romance. It ends happily. I would watch it again and recommend it to others. I read that Park Min young went on a very restricted diet to be even more thin for her role as a cancer patient and want to say she just, overall, did an outstanding job of portraying the role. I think she is a remarkable actress and I seek out series where she is in a lead role. Having seen Lee Yi Kyung in comedic roles, I was unsure he could play the sleazy, evil ex husband well, but he did an incredible job making the viewer loath the character.SpoilersI think it is a dramatically different experience watching this after having read the web novel and/or webtoon versus never having read either. It does follow the webtoon closely, which is good, but there are some deviations I do not think improved the story line or made it better adapted to a live show. I think they did it to add intrigue but, to me, the events from the webtoon were compelling enough.The things that were different from the comic to the webtoon:1. In the comic the Yoo Ji Hyuk (Na In woo), her former college classmate, who harbored an unrequited love for Jiwon, discovered her body after realizing she was missing from the hospital. He was so devastated by her death that he killed himself in the ocean. He didn't ever have a fiancé and Jiwon was his one true love. He always knew he loved her but stayed away because he thought she found happiness elsewhere and didn't want to interfere. That's why he made an effort to get closer to her when they regressed. He wasn't going to let her husband ruin her life again. In the live action version they chose to have him die in a car accident which, I felt, was less impactful.2. In the Webtoon version, the lady supervisor, who becomes a good friend of Jiwon, had a very different romantic story. In the Webtoon, Yang Juran's (Gong Min jeung) love interest was younger than her and had a fun, carefree personality. Because her married life was so difficult and she was so serious at work, it made sense for her to fall for the younger man. There was some moral conflict in the comic about whether it was okay to fall for him, but she lost out at the end. In the live action, Mrs. Yang's love interest is Lee Suk jun (Ha Do kwan) who is an austere, older executive who is unapproachable to most but shows a softer side to Mrs. Yang. It took out the whole Noona trope and added in a cold executive vibe which I did not feel was a good fit for a side romance.3. In the webtoon, Jiwon convinced Mrs. Yang to get tested for her stomach and that's how she found out early enough to fight the cancer. It became a plot hole, in the live version, when Mrs. Yang's cancer was not terminal like Jiwon's was in the Webtoon version. Yet, in the live version, Mrs. Yang caught the cancer early, without any intervention from Jiwon. That type of cancer is infrequently caught in the early stages so it made less sense for Mrs. Yang to catch it early all on her own.4. In the live action version, I didn't like how active of a role Jiwon had to take to take down Minwan and Sumin. In the scene where she catches them cheating, she gets in a physical altercation with Sumin and Minwan which makes it look like she was the aggressor and the push that wound up ending her life was just them fighting back harder than they should have. They did not highlight, in the live action, that she was still alive after she fell against the glass table and they did nothing to try to save her life. The moral ambiguity continued through the live action when Jumin was completely willing to let Sumin die in her place. In the comics, once Minwan and married, they continued to attack each other. They self destructed. Minwan's azoospermia took a more active role. After su-min ""lost"" her fake baby, the mom was a nightmare about conceiving and blaming her all the time. The home life was hell with the mom. She went to get fertility testing at the moms behest and demanded Minwan get tested too and that's how she found out. She brought it to the mom and the mom was so angry she had a stroke. In the webtoon , Sumin became her mother-in-law's sole caretaker and tormented her to get revenge for the way she was treated. But she was also was cruel to the mother-in-law after the stroke simply because she was not a very nice person as evidenced in the way she treated Jiwon when she had terminal cancer. Sumin's evil nature was further revealed in the Webtoon when she resolved to kill the mother-in-law by putting air in her IV line. There was a witness and she was caught and sent to prison. Meanwhile Minwan decided to get ride of Sumin for insurance money and cuts her brakes. He hears about his mom and rushes over, forgetting about the brakes and dies. Sumin then escapes from custody and tries to run over Jiwon with a car but Mr Yu jumps in front to save her and goes to the hospital. SuMin is captured again. In the webtoon, Sumin, the mother, and Minwan bring about their own destruction while the Jiwon and Jihyuk build their relationship and remain happy. I liked that the Webtoon did not make Jiwon actively steering events so that others died. Having them self destruct made her a much more heroic and sympathetic character.5. In the comics the characters weren't quite so intensely bound by the concept of ""transferring fate"". No one died by a coffee table again. Their actions had a real impact on the timeline and they weren't as helpless.6. There was no ex fiancé in the Webtoon. It was a huge cliche and caused way more drama than necessary. Oh Yu Ra (Kwon Bo ah or simply BoA) was a bland, stereotypical spoiled chaebol type with little dimension beyond ""she's just crazy"". It created a love triangle that was completely unnecessary to the plot.7. The twist that Mr Yu regressed as well was made way too early in the show. In the comic it was a last reveal, and done through a letter while Mr Yu was in the hospital. Jiwon learned everything he had done for her and how long he loved her and why he died before. Her father brought him back from death. He overcame his fate to be with her.8 The romance between the sister, Yoo Hui yeon (Choi Gyu-ri), and the chef, Baek Eun Ho (Lee Gi Kwang) was way cuter in the comics. They barely developed it in the show. She tried really hard to win his heart and he had lingering feelings for Jiwon but eventually came around. They shared a love of desserts.#ParkMinYoung#ChoiGyuri#LeeGiKwang#KwonBoAh#UhmSeohyun#LeeYiKyung#LeeGiKwang#MarryMyHusband.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Production is good. Concept is good. Acting is not bad. Storyline is confusing. It's as if these people are written to make bad choices in life. I'm wondering if this is a cultural thing. I know many people who are invested in K dramas and would spend weeks and weeks watching episode after episode. They miss sleep to know what is next. And they all have one thing in common, they have this Mexican soap opera drama view of life. The reactions of the characters to incidents are very curious. This isn't a spoiler as it is the theme of this series, but the reaction to a close friend's betrayal is confounding. The people I know who are very into these k-dramas are also the same people who posts about self help memes on their social media. I wonder if there's a correlation?This is drawn out to the point where the scene is sooo thin that I wish they just get to it. The long drawn out gazes if taken out, probably would cut this series by half.The good thing is that the women are shown here as capable, talented and also conniving.These are my observations and frustrations trying to watch this for future topics of small talks.

tt26628595,"I always like Park Min Young shows and her sweetness radiates here. She has always been good at looking sad too. But she lost too much weight for this role and it was not really necessary for the story to be that thin. It does make one sympathetic towards her sick character. She does showcase many lovely outfits. Fashion is quite a part of this show and both her and her tall co star Na In Woo have hair and wardrobe makeovers and lose their glasses. Superficial but lots of fun how they transform quite a lot from their ill fitting outfits to the latest dresses and sharp suits. The most interesting characters are the villainous couple Lee Yi Kyeong is the comic relief. Talented musical actor as well. Song Ha Yoon plays the toxic friend who is just so jealous and obsessive. Seems over the top but there are people like that in real life. Her character is quite realistic and subtle at first. She is a villain that will go down in K drama history as a memorably insane woman.The story has a very similar premise to the recently series Perfect Marriage Revenge with the murder and going back in time. But this show is better. Things do move quite quickly from her murdered 2023 timeline to the 2013 second chance time. She then proceeds to fix things and it is fun to see her getting strong and the villainous couple getting their comeuppance. Ep9 and 10 are quite feel good. But there is some drag in the pace before they do. Then another murderous villain comes in played by BoA who is quite unpleasant to watch. Should have stuck to singing. They carefully plot to change their fate to the other couple and the director clearly differentiates what happened before and what is happening now. Still, if some plot digressions had been cut and the series was just 12 episodes instead of 16, this would have been a better show. The ending completely and thoroughly gives closure to all the characters with a nice big happy conclusion wedding babies and all. Not like some rushed ending series. So at least things ended well.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"This show cannot be classified conventionally, unless you use a lot of contradictory tags.Is this a soap opera?Yes, definitely, but with an unusual premise and with gender twists.Is this a comedy?Yes, and with very funny scenes and characters, but with a lot of tragic drama and a bit of thrill.Is this about women's empowerment?Yes, definitely, but with a very romantic male hero, which seems to be against the general idea, but the actor is so cute that his character really works.Is this cheesy?Yes, in a Korean-cheese way, which I usually dislike, but this time made the trick.Is this cartoonish?Yes, of course, it is based on a webtoon and it shows, but the actors are accomplished, and they bring to life what could have been just anime characters in black and white.Is this based on values?Yes, and it also shows. That is refreshing.Is this frivolous?Yes, but it also poses philosophical questions related to destiny and the possibility of changing one's life.I am not a particular fan of K-dorama shows, but I must say that I enjoyed this very much, despite all the «buts» and «c'mons» that I usually object when I give a try to this type of series. So, much to my own surprise, I honestly recommend it!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Was highly looking forward to this series. Notwithstanding all the personal controversies surrounding Park Min Young, the drama started out with fantasy-suspense plot of a woman who's been given a miraculous second chance after suffering neglect and abuse by her two timing husband and manipulation by scheming bestie, and finally dying in their hands. Na In Woo plays the male lead and director (and hidden owner) of the company where Park Min Young's character works. He is miraculously given a second chance too and together the leads embark on a path to seek revenge and reclaim their lives through overturning their past fates. After some middling dramas, Na In Woo stands out here, and a veteran like Park Kin Young is great at creating chemistry. Together with the revenge plot and the suspense of how the leads' fate will chalk out this time around, the first 10-11 episodes are excellent and gripping. However, after that the drama degenerates into a soap with the two main antagonists appearing more and more deranged: therefore seeming like caricatures than real people. The introduction of a completely unnecessary character in the form of the male lead's ex-fiancée further boggles the plot. It seems that the writers couldn't figure out how to unravel the tangles once they had been created. The ex-fiancee is introduced as a plot device to solve some questions and is simply not a believable character. In the end, the storyline in the last few episodes makes all the villains look like comic book megalomaniac anti-heroes and the plot loses its credibility: despite the fantasy setting in the first place.Unrelated to the story, I couldn't help but notice: Several times in the episodes Park Ming Young's character is referred to as being 'all skin and bones', and she is that. If she is unwell and has lost weight that's another thing, but it's a totally unhealthy look and alarming to think that other girls may want to emulate her. I wish the producers had insisted on her gaining some weight before she signed on.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

I love the satisfaction of seeing the villains get what they deserve, public humiliation at that! Wohoooo!I totally cracked up by the psycho best friend's reaction in the panties scenes. LOL.I seldom commend villains in a series but I think she did a great job in playing her character.One downside of this story that's why i'm giving it an 8 is there are too many bad and crazy people in it that it doesn't seem realistic anymore. It's just one after the other. Episode 12 is my least favorite when the ex-fiancé showed up. She's very unnecessary and her reasons for over the top revenge plot doesn't make sense at all, or at least justify everything she did.I like how they wrapped up the series for the main characters. It came to a full circle and you can't help but be happy for them. I also like how they show the connections from the future and the present scenes.Although I would say that their chemistry is just so-so - compared to the WWWSK tandem that will melt you.I would have loved to see the present development of Ms. Yang and Mr. Lee, though. As well as Eunho and Heeyeon (i love her bubbly self).Overall, this is a good watch and can be recommended.P. S. This is totally unrelated.

If you like soap suds with your dramas, this is a perfect fit. On that end, my complaint is that it became too sudsy near the end, where bad people turned into virtual cartoon characters of real people. In my view, a good sudsy drama has to stay a little farther from the line or its impact is lost. Once the former fiancée of the male lead enters the picture, it starts getting way too over the top. Still worth watching, just too much. The female lead shines, as always, just like she did in Ms. Kim, although I think she's gotten a bit too thin. The one who continues to impress is the female assistant manager who I have seen elsewhere. This actress has quite a range. The lead female villain plays the role in the only way it makes sense, a true psychopath. The former fiancé I found a bit bland, but, that is partly a result of dull writing which relied too much on plot events for her. Her dialogue deserved more snap. The other actors and actresses did there jobs, but this is not supposed to be so long. Nonetheless, a definite thumbs up.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Marry My Husband centers around an ill woman who receives the final blow when she learns her bestie and husband are having an affair. She dies soon after, but is given a second chance at life.Marry My Husband makes it easy to fall in love with protagonist Kang Ji-won - and that's already half the battle won for this K-drama. Park Min-young effortlessly portrays her as smart and kind, though not in a superficial way, but a little too naive and trusting. Yet, she's learning from her past (or, in this case, future) mistakes and evolving as a person. Thankfully, it's a gradual process that allows the audience space to root for Ji-won as the show progresses, while acknowledging that she can't possibly handle it all on her own.To that end, Ji-won is surrounded by a cast of equally charming, if fairly one-dimensional, characters. There's her bubbly co-worker Yu Hee-yeon (Choi Gyu-ri), who gives Ji-won a makeover, well-meaning but meek assistant manager Yang Joo-ran (Gong Min-jung) and her stoic but secretly soft-hearted boss and love interest Yu Ji-hyuk (Na In-woo). They are as tropey and archetypal as K-drama characters come, but in a way that's also their job, to not detract from who we're all here for: Kang Ji-won. It may not be the most groundbreaking of shows, but that's not what it's trying to be either. This Korean drama knows it's a guilty pleasure through and through, and embraces that wholeheartedly. There is something immensely satisfying about seeing a carefully drawn-out, deliciously manipulative revenge plan slowly but steadily unfold onscreen. It satisfies by giving the audience exactly what they want by letting Ji-won get her payback, with a handful of unexpected twists that are just enough to keep viewers running back for more.My Rating : 8.4/10.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"The short answer is yes, the long answer is no.The WEBTOON of ""Marry My Husband"" has a combined total of 69 episodes including the spins offs. Fitting 58 episodes of the main story into just 16 TV episodes obviously isn't going to do the story full justice, but I'll give this series a 10 anyway.The main difference is the pacing, as you could expect. I felt like a lot of the plot points were miss timed, or that they were shortened or lengthened compared to the webcomic. I'll be comparing most of this show to the comic... since that's what it was based on.From my memory, Eun-ho didn't have as much of a significant plot as he did in the show. He ran a cafe, not a restaurant, then left the country for a while and wasn't seen in the comic until near the end. Ji-Hyuk also didn't really interfere with Ji-won's plans and life after returning to 2013, he trusted her enough to know what was going to happen to handle a lot of the issues herself-this Ji-Hyuk in the show is much more overbearing. Yu-ra, from what I recall, was not as big of a plot point as she was made out in the show. I don't believe she came back as a vengeful ex-fiancé, if I'm remembering right she and Ji-won ended up on good terms; but I could be miss-remembering. She also doesn't kill Ji-won's mom, I do believe that Ji-Hyuk paid Ji-won's mom not to bother her again. Ji-hyuk didn't die in a car accident, in the webcomic he was so distraught after Ji-won's death-which I believe he whitenesses-that he ended up taking his own life; Min-hwan's death later ends up mirroring that, Min-hwan takes Ji-hyuk's fate. Ji-won doesn't change immediately like in the show, it was gradual and she wasn't as instantly opposed to Sumin; she had her head on straight and was more into playing the long game. She was better at concealing her emotions. Also in the webcomic the taxi driver, Ji-won's dad, gives her a candy not money, and Ji-hyuk never got that weird heart tattoo. Miss Yang's plot was accurate if not a little looked over, she had a lot more going on that she did in the show.Separating the show from the webcomic however, it was great! I loved it. But you do need to think of them as two separate entities. Unlike some book to movie adaptations, say Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings, which try to stay as accurate as possible to the story, this is not. It's good, it's just not an accurate comparison. I personally always enjoy the book more when it comes to BTM adaptations, but that's because you can build so much more character and world into the story with the time allotted. You can't do that with a show. This show does really good with taking the plot points and molding them into what they needed to be a TV show, this story could have only been a TV show, a movie wouldn't have done it justice.I really enjoyed it, thee really isn't anything I would change except for Ji-hyuk's death. He didn't seem desperate enough in the show, which is what I think the comic did really well. Ji-hyuk's emotions were more deeply explored in the webcomic, in the show he felt very flat or one note. His entire personality was Ji-won, whether she wanted him to or not, and I think that's unfair to both characters.Sumin's end could have been dealt with better, for some reason I feel like she broke out of prison at one point, but I could be mixing my comics together. This is such a common trope in WEBTOON that it's hard to keep them straight, ""There Must Be a Happy Ending"" is another comic very, very similar to this one. But out of all the webcomics like this that I've read I'm glad that it was this one that was made into a show. It's gotten so much love and I'm glad the author had gotten their flowers.If you're trying to get into K-Dramas, or maybe want to get into webcomics, this is a good start. I hope they come out with more webcomic to move adaptations. ""True Beauty"" is another one, but that story was never as good as this, so I didn't watch is all the way through. I'm just pleased to see that webcomics are getting more recognition!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

These two actors REALLY don't have a feeling for each other. If I think back on secretary Kim and sizzle that relationship was!The girl villain in the story has to rely on screaming and screeching to portray her evilness.. probably not the fault of the actress in this case, but how she is directed. The story only picks up when the evil doing ramps up, that's just not how a drama should grab your attention. There is no real character growth, not twist that is interesting in any way..

tt26628595,"I know only 6 episodes are out right now but honestly, I think I can already tell how the story is going to go.I read the manhwa and the manhwa was great! The storyline was enticing, interesting, and easy to digest. It went straight to the point, didn't have any unnecessary fluff and it was easy to follow and the plot twists was thrilling.I was super excited for the adaptation but I am disappointed. I thought it would follow closely to the manhwa but it didn't which made the episodes dull, boring, and un-organized. So far, it's giving ""Strong Woman. Do Bong Soon"" where some of the characters were 2 dimensional, the plot didn't make sense or at least the scenes leading up was anti-climatic, and the flow wasn't flowing. That's exactly what's happening to Marry my Husband. Like I need more revenge. They should have just done 12 episodes instead of 16.Some of the actors that were chosen were okay, they could have done better with the casting because the chemistry was barely there for the two leads.

I watched until episode 9 hoping the plot would improve, unfortunately it didn't happen, the episodes continued to be boring and dull. It will be impossible to watch until the last episode, sixteen in total at this rate it becomes tiring in this search for revenge. It lacks action, determination, pulse, it lacks a little comedy, it lacks joy. This kdrama is one of the weakest I've watched and followed until now.

Almost everything bad that could happen,it happened to her. And it just never stops! We know that the Korean dramas makers are keen to exaggeration but my God,did they overdid this time haha.Like it wasn't enough that female lead is dying from the cancer and married to a guy who mistreats her and mentally abuses her,used her as a source of money so he doesn't have to work,she has mother in law who is absolutely unbearable and humiliates her in every way possible and makes her feel like a worthless piece of cr*p all while her husbund is cheating on her with her sly,manipulative,evil ""best friend"" who hates her the most as it seems but keeps our female lead delusional and with fake sense of friendship and ""sisterhood"".Noo,all this wasn't enough so there is a female lead's mother who emerged so that she can conspire with all those people I described above to kill her daughter she hasn't seen 15 years and take all of the money that she was given by the unbelievably unreal male lead,aka ""prince charming"".Throughout all the series the creators showed us that everyone who came across the female lead's path hates her and treats her as she isn't worthy of any decency but of course there is a perfect prince charming who gives everything for her. She even ends up winning over his ridiculusy rich and grumpy grandpa to adore her and she ends up being the richest and respected woman in S. Korea.Her mother despised her,her husband,his mother,her best friend,everyone in school,her superior at work...but there is a perfectly nice,handsome,insanely rich guy who fell in love with her and made her life a fairiy tale.If I wanted to see stuff like that,I'd watch cindarella or sleeping beauty or beauty and the beast.

The show is pure entertainment and sometimes it makes you wonder whether it takes itself seriously. The smooth transition between plot development and outrageously funny scenes is nothing short of brilliant.This goes on for the first 8 episodes or so. Once it transitions into the later stages it takes a sharp turn towards typical Korean rom com. Which isn't bad in itself but it did leave me sightly disappointed. It left me with the impression that it started incredibly strong and ended on a low note.The chemistry between the couples is one of the show's strongest points. You can clearly tell they are extremely comfortable in each other's presence.

Age wise as well as attractive wise.2) Fast paced and 90% of the screen time is devoted to main couples.3) It's funny and entertaining. Yeah, I can't remember last time seeing a romantic show with funny lines and lots of funny scenes Finally, Kdrama is getting the humor right.4) Very likable side couple and their story so far.5) And the most important thing in the show :- Story and Romance. It clicks. It clicks from very first moment in the show. The chemistry between them makes you feel involve in the show from very first episode.🇰🇷 You don't have to wait for second and third episodes for it. And I have seen lots of Kdramas in the past and there are very few shows who manages to do that. It gets your attention and the next thing you know is that you are addicted. You just can't stop watching.6) Message to the director, writer and producer. Thank you for bringing this show on netflix. The feeling one gets from watching a romantic kdrama is something out of this world. Its a special feeling you get when you are in love.

tt14819828,"There is much to like in ""A Business Proposal."" The story may seem a bit cliched, but it's the execution of that story that makes it stand out from so many others. It's smooth and the writers are careful not to change the character for the sake of the plot, which is too common of a mistake that I've seen. What really makes this series stand out is the strength of the two main female characters in Ha Ri Shin and Jin Young Seo.Too often, we see young women in K-Dramas act indecisively and like wallflowers whenever they face obstacles. They tend to be too easily influenced by their parents or peers, unable to make decisions for themselves. And when faced with hardship, they tend to wilt faster than a flower in the scorching sun. Not these two! Ha Ri Shin and Jin Young Seo are strong women who are decisive, mature, and can think for themselves. They are also not afraid to stand up for themselves, which is something very refreshing about this series!My favorite series involving ""young love"" is still ""Our Beloved Summer"" but this one comes awfully close! My favorite shows of the older and more mature persuasion are too tough to call. With fantastic shows in ""Mr. Sunshine,"" ""Crash Landing On You,"" and ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha"" it's tough to decide. 'The pacing of this show is perfect! Everything moves along smoothly without extraneous scenes or ridiculous new storylines to keep the story going. Therefore, I was grateful that the series ended after 12 episodes. Everything was covered, and there was no reason to attempt to stretch things out.It's really hard for me to decide which character--and even actress--I like more between Kim Se Jeong (Ha Ri Shin) and Seol In Ah (Jin Young Seo). Both are marvelous as two young women who initially set out to scheme their way through a blind date that neither of them wants, to figuring out how to be with the men that they love. Both bring a refreshing strength and even feistiness to their roles. As I said, these two women are not wallflowers. They can take care of and look out for themselves. I've seen Kim Se Jeong before in ""Uncanny Counter""--and imagine my thrill to learn that there is another series of that one coming!--but this is my first exposure to the equally beautiful and captivating Seol In Ah.The only characters I pretty much despised were Da Goo Kang, the grandfather, and Min Woo. Da Goo Kang is a typical bully with nothing but selfish intentions. Meddlers always have that in common. Their attempts to control others under the guise of ""love"" is truly sickening. If it's selfish, it cannot be love since love can never be selfish. I was thrilled to find Ha Ri Shin not giving into Da Goo Kang's immaturity and selfishness. I was worried that she was going to cave into him. And Jin Young Seo was a true champion standing up to her own father, who was just as much of a bully as the grandfather. Bullies only get their power when someone gives it to them. At heart, they are gutless cowards.Ha Ri proves her strength by not seeing herself as an inferior person just because she doesn't come from a wealthy family. And Jin Young Seo proves her strength by having the courage to break free of her father's iron grip.Min Woo, a longtime friend and initial crush of Ha Ri, is a despicable young man who has a girlfriend, but behaves in a most insensitive manner when he demonstrates his feelings for Ha Ri right in front of his girlfriend! I was initially surprised that Ha Ri would not call him out for this. I certainly would not want a ""friend"" who does something so vile and cruel to someone else. Fortunately, she finally does let him have it, even though it was a bit long time in coming.The series is a step in the right direction if the aim is to project strong, female characters and demonstrate that they are people too as well as characters who will not yield to the cheap intimidation tactics that so many of their counterparts in the past have done. I was more than thrilled to see these characters did not take the road most others have traveled by, but instead, carved out their own road by showcasing empowered women.As I stated before, I hope to see more series with strong women in the future!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14819828,I have reviewed around 100 TV & Movie shows over the last 3 years or so and this is only my second 10 for a whole season ( The Queens Gambit was the other one ) - I think having to wait a week to watch 2 more shows only added to my addiction for this amazing romance. The only flaw that almost took it to a 9 was the disguise that Ha Ri used to fool the Chairman and Kang would only fool a blind man and Lois Lane. The fact that all but one episode ended with a good feeling was a tribute to the show runner and writers - it kept you wanting to come back for the next episode with out using cliff hanger tired tricks. What surprised me most was I enjoyed the un-dubbed voices without having a clue as to what they were saying without the subtitles - as opposed to being annoying - I found it refreshing to hear the actual voices of the actors . The lead actress Se-Jeong Kim was a delight and worth the watch all by herself.,positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14819828,"Well I cannot say this is my favourite drama of all time but it sure gave me two of my favourite characters and those are Shin Haa-ri and Jin Young-seo. These two best friends give us friendship goals in every frame they are in. They truly define that friendship isn't about class or status but a bond formed overtime which keeps growing on stronger and stronger.This Romantic Comedy drama shows the journey of our lead couple Kang Tae-moo and Shin Haa-ri and our second lead couple Cha Sung-hoon and Jin Young-seo.There are many funny moments in the entire series. Haa-ri's team members and Young-seo's cousin are hilarious at times and have good timing. Especially the cousin held on her role very well. She's most funny when she speaks in English. The cousin interaction in the car is one of the best funny scene I've seen this year.The series has successfully paved the romantic road for both the couples at their own speed. They haven't rushed into anything which I liked.Another thing I liked about the storyline is that there isn't any past connections of the lead characters which is seen in many K-dramas. There is a disturbing past of the lead character but is handled in a matured manner by the lead couple.And lastly the bond of the young generation with their parents. I loved how the Shin family had practically adopted Yeoung-su and in return how she is so down to earth and kind, caring and helpful towards Haa-ri's parents.Overall I liked the drama. The first half was really good and I feel they could have made the second half a bit short. There wasn't much of a story there and I found it a bit boring. The second lead couple is what kept me going till the last episode.Even if this isn't my favourite it surely is one which I enjoyed and loved the most. It was different in some ways and didn't have some ingredients a typical kdrama has. I also loved the ending. They haven't streched that part much and has wrapped up the drama as it should have been.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Then, stumble upon this romcom and it becomes my go-to relaxing content to consume everyday. The chemistry of the cast is so awesome that makes me cannot resist. The story lines are so funny yet some stories just so relatable. I rewatch the drama almost everyday, sometime just some cuts but it s like a chill pill for me.

tt14819828,"This was supposed to be the most popular drama of 2022, but in my opinion the series is the perfect compilation of every cliché in every romantic K-drama ever! At the beginning looks interesting, funny, good humor but after episode 5 it just gets boring.We have here rich CEO- poor girl, childhood trauma (ofc dead parents), he takes her shopping, fake relationship, some ex love and his super jealous girlfriend who gets involved in the main character life just for any reason. Than we have the nosy grandparent, who doesn't approve the relationship, the ""funny"" girl with the American accent who is just pointless and annoying.At the pick of the drama they present us with a random non specific illness that only USA doctors know how to treat. The lead leave for the states for a year just to come back, and spoiler alert, to propose.The two support characters are more realistic and likable then the main ones. The man lead is nice but lacks experience while the female lead for me is just not realistic with a below average acting. Everyone talking about the chemistry between the two leads but I didn't see or feel any, the love scenes were rigid, cold the did not give me any emotions at all. I am a huge fan of k dramas but this one did not deliver anything expected. The script was not original, no twists, everything was so predictable... to sum all together- boring.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Because if you compare this one to gems like ""secret garden"" or ""my love from the star"" it doesn't stand a chance! It is foreseeable and uptight, like a movie of the fifties. The female leads - both adults! - behave childish, insecure and have small self-confidence - what a role model for the girls of today! And the friends of the female lead: If you have friends like this, there is no need for enemies!

tt14819828,"Honestly, there is nothing particularly bad to say about Business Proposal. It's generally your pretty standard chaebol-meets-commoner k-drama, with good modern production values and solid acting.On the up side, it's one of those series where all of the characters are basically fun and likeable, none of the characters are egregiously annoying (okay, there's one weirdo who doesn't add much aside from being weird), and none of the drama derives from the sort of eye-rolling acts of dumb misunderstanding that fuels most k-dramas! And there are some real moments of brilliance in the first few episodes.On the down side, past a certain point it becomes pretty by-the-numbers k-drama, and while there's still nothing bad to say about it, it stops really doing anything to stand out. That said, with its 12 episode run length, it doesn't feel like it's padded or overstaying its welcome.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14819828,"8.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2022 South Korean romantic comedy drama with 12, 60 minute episodes. It is known by the alternate title ""The Office Blind Date.""Shin Ha-ri (Kim Se-jeong) often does odd jobs for her friend and heiress Jin Young-seo (Seol In-ah). This one is even a bit much for her but she still agrees to pretend to be her friend and go on a blind date, playing a vixen, in a deliberate attempt to ""botch"" it. Little does Ha-ri know but the blind date is none other than Kang Tae-mu (Ahn Hyo-seop), the new CEO of Ha-ri's company. Tired of the whole blind date circus, Tae-mu vowed to just get it over with and marry his next blind date. Tae-mu did not realize that the next blind date would be a deception and that he was not going out with an heiress, Young-seo, but an employee at his company. It is not long before he discovers that Ha-ri is not Young-seo but he is not sure who she is and when he asks for her real name she gives him another psuedonym she often uses with her friend's friends and not her real name which would have revealed she was actually his employee. Tae-mu still does not know Ha-ri works for him and hilariaty ensues as she hides the fact from him. Tae-mu's grandfather, Kang Da-goo (Lee Deok-hwa) has been pressuring his grandsone to find a suitable marriage partner as he is the heir to the conglomerate. Tae-mu bullies and bribes Ha-ri into pretending to be his fiancée in exchange for 800,000 won per date. While Ha-ri is not keen on this level of deception she agrees as she is constantly looking for money to cover her families' financial woes. Young-seo takes another route to escape the constant pressure of finding a marriage partner, she moves out of her father's house and finds herself next door to none other than Tae-mu's, Chief of Staff/like a brother, Kim Min-kyu (Cha Sung-hoon) who finds the heiress very alluring yet is angry at the way she deceived his boss/like a brother. The set up is ripe for laughter inducing moments and a multitude of misunderstandings. Can the four young people navigate the expectations placed on them and be able to find their own path to love?I loved this and would definitely recommend others watch it and I would rewatch it. That being said, there are some flaws that exist when compared to the web toon it is based on. The web toon was more flawless in my opinion as it stayed away from some tropes that can be tiring where this returned to them and deviated. Spoilers* In the web toon the grandfather liked Ha-ri throughout and would chastise the Tae-Mu anytime grandfather felt Tae-Mu was not treating her right. In the drama rendition the grandfather was more of a stereotypical Korean wealthy parental figure and disapproved of the relationship. In the end, there was a very short piece about him not coming back until she accepted the ring which indicated she finally won his approval but it was way too short relative to the length of time he had disapproved. There was also the separation trope in the drama rendition that did not exist in the web toon. I am not a fan of the separations that are usually a year or more. In real life it rarely makes the heart grow fonder and more often just causes people to grow apart. It was not necessary and they could have stuck with the way it was in the web toon. The chemistry between the actors was really good. Kim Seo-jong reminds me of Emma Stone in both her looks and her voice. It is said we all have ""twins"" running around in people that have similar features and I see that in international stars. I think Kim Seo-jong was well cast in the Ha-ri role as she was a pro at carrying out the comedic aspects of hiding like she did whenever her secret was about to be discovered. As many have observed, 12 episodes did not feel like enough. There was still room to carry out aspects that were reflective of the web toon. In the web toon Ha-ri did not give in to marriage right away and he was insistent on marrying her because he vowed to marry the next person he went on a blind date with and carried that through despite the deception. There was a lot of comedy associated with that in the web toon. There is also the concern that Netflix is setting a standard of a shorter number of episodes and one thing many like about South Korean dramas is the depth of story and character development that can only be achieved in at least 16 episodes. In this case, 12 episodes meant they rushed certain aspects of the story and did not fully tell others. I loved the relationship of Ha-ri and Young-seo and it made sense how she came to do the blind date as they would do practically anything for the other. Tae-mu and Min-kyu's brother like relationship was also very enjoyable and heart warming. It went a bit more risque in the bedroom scene than was necessary and I felt it deviated from the way South Korean dramas typically portray intimacy. All of the characters were well cast and it was enjoyable watching the character and relationship developments. I thoroughly enjoyed this drama but hope that Neflix will not continue to deviate from a formula that works so well for South Korea drama. As a huge South Korean drama fan I do not want to see South Korean dramas ""Americanized."" I rarely watch American dramas for many of the reasons that make me love South Korean dramas. American dramas are typically too short, too risque, don't have a lot of character or plot development and unnecessarily introduce sad elements.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14819828,"First of all if you're someone who doesn't like product placement this show isn't for you. Considering most of the characters work for well known Korean food brand Bibigo it does at times feel like one long infomercial. (Having said that I do fancy trying their kimchi ravioli).The show itself feels like a check list of standard Korean romantic comedies. A main character with an unresolved childhood trauma - tick, a main character ends up in hospital will others rush to be their side - tick, main male & female leads have a heart to heart in a kids playground - tick, etc. All that's missing is a character talking to a dead relative at a grave side/crematorium & no-one suffers from memory loss.Mind you sometimes it's enjoyable to watch something cliched, however the big dramatic pay off scenes at the end are rushed or not properly concluded. Two of the characters disappear, as if the actors had already moved onto other jobs, & so their big confrontation scenes were replaced with another character passing on a message from them. ""He/she couldn't be here so this what they wanted to say"". Another character announces they're going to start their own business & suddenly it's a year later & we have to assume whatever that business was is doing well. There's an emotional misunderstanding plotline between the main leads that in any other kdrama would at least last 1 or 2 episodes, but is over in 10 mins before it's even really started.Ironically seeing as this show is about a food company, it feels like the kdrama version of fast food. Enjoyable while watching but fails to be satisfying or fulfilling when over.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14819828,"This is a lovely show if you enjoy old-age social hierarchies, where the rich abuse the poor and men abuse women while making them believe they are lucky not to be allowed to take decisions on their own. There are some moments of a man saving the damsel in distress, but mostly a rich guy not taking a no for an answer is portrayed as the perfect plot to gain a woman's heart. Add some superficial friends to feature how women gossip, men compete for the highest branch in the tree where humanity lives, and you have this script where money is the only thing that anybody but the 'nice' (psycho) guy and his target consider important. The secondary story features a very attractive actor whose expressions actually seem quite natural. There is another actress playing a bossy lady in middle management that is also good at making her lines believable.

Tae Mu and Hari dated with marriage in mind from episode 1, fake, then real, they finally get together, but end up separated for one year so Tae Mu's grandfather could be treated for a life threatening illness in the states. I hoped Hari and Tae Mu would reunite and get married in the final episode! Now, I definitely hope there will be a Season 2. Tae Mu and Hari will finally get married and we'll get to see their lives grow. I also hope Young Seo and Seong Hun marry and possibly adopt a child from the same orphanage Seong Hun was adopted.

tt14819828,"I have now seen several Korean series and although almost all of them had scenes and characters that were meant to be funny, this one had more, so the genre must be romantic comedy (even though there is the contrived 'dark secret from the past' element in this one, too).Okay, so how funny is it? Not very funny to me; I don't really like it when the source of comedy is the characters shouting or hitting each other (e.g. The female protagonist's mother) or somebody tripping and falling down, or hiding in the bathroom when someone really badly wants to get in... Another source of humor is when the characters get drunk (interestingly, in Korean series, it is usually the girls - I'm guessing that this is regarded as cute). The scenes of the somewhat pitiful tertiary couple (Shin Hari's older co-workers) are sometimes mildly entertaining, especially the guy acting stupid. It is also somewhat entertaining that the rich guy (male lead) is compared to some dinosaur bird (I have forgotten the name), this is his name in the protagonist's phone and every time he calls her, this bird appears on the screen in animated format. It is also quite funny that the characters often watch scenes from an over-the-top k-drama, while they are also a part of one...How romantic is it? Very romantic, although full of clichés... Rich guy falls for poor girl and after lots of misunderstandings, trials and tribulations, they fall in love and he asks her to marry him. Okay, nothing original here, but like in other Korean series, the romantic tension is built up very slowly, in a somewhat old-fashioned way (you know, like in the world of Jane Austen), so lots of women will find it enjoyable (I don't mean to be sexist, men might enjoy it too, I just doubt it :)). This world is really materialistic (everybody envies the protagonist for the rich suitor, who flaunts his money quite shamelessly), but people's character also matters a lot, along with old-fashioned values (e.g. Respect for one's superiors and elders).I suppose the male lead is good-looking (although the guy playing the secondary male lead, his secretary, is better-looking, in my opinion), but I found it difficult to get over the fact that his hands are a weird red color all the time (a very different color from his face). The female lead is played by a pretty, lively girl, and the secondary female lead is cute, too. As an interesting inconsistency, the female protagonist first draws the male protagonist's interest on the blind date because she seems bolder and different than all the serious girls he has met before, but later on, it turns out that Shin Hari is a normal girl, too (only poorer than the rich serious girls). She is submissive, modest, hardworking, gets embarrassed all the time, talks to her superiors and older people in a respectful manner, etc. Okay, she can drink a lot of alcohol, but this seems like acceptable behaviour for a nice girl in South Korea. She is portrayed as somewhat competitive, but nothing out of the ordinary. Her best friend is slightly more interesting.In this show, both the primary and the secondary couple are shown to have sex before marriage (there are no graphic sex scenes, but it is obvious), so in this respect, it is somewhat more modern than other Korean series.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I like ML and FL and their chemistry initially but it gets boring and shallow soon when ML tries to win girl's friends and family showing off his wealth and repeatedly tells the shallowest reason for falling in love with FL.

That's exactly what Business Proposal is! All of the main characters, the two couples that we follow, are likeable, and they have great chemistry making it all the more enjoyable to watch. The actors are also a really good and not stiff or cringe at all (apart from the main character's mother's character that I found a bit too much with the constant beating and yelling, but that was part of her character, not the actress' fault in any way. I just would have hoped they maybe could have toned it down a bit. She was balanced out with the more quiet father, so that at least brought balance.

He literally looks lost onscreen, his attempts to show emotions or spiritual ups and downs are cringe worthy. This constant in-your-face show of his grandfather's wealth is pathetic. The female lead does her best, but her role becomes repetitive and bland. How many times can she apologize and cringe in visible discomfort?I may keep watching just to enjoy the story of the second couple who have much better chemistry between them.What a miscast for the male lead role.... What a pity. He's insufferable as an actor.PS: Watched Abyss with the same male lead. He actually can play if a role entails more than walking around in expensive coat and shoes looking rich.

tt14819828,"I have seen a number of high rated romantic Kdramas, and loved this one. It is fast moving, and has 12 rather than the usual 16 episodes. Couldn't fault the main stars and two supporting characters. I liked that despite maintaining the typical themes and style of romantic Kdramas (which really are great over and over!) it was also on the realistic side. There were no fears of kidnap and no shooting etc. Individual story lines didn't drag on and it flowed very well. I also liked how the two main romantic relationships were hiked up a level (i.e more typical of modern couples today) which is rarely seen in Kdramas (although the good ones do get it right - and A Business Proposal is no exception here). I didn't really find the grandfather that annoying(as wealthy seniors in these dramas often can be), and he was a good character I thought. Very entertaining and a pleasure to watch throughout.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14819828,"I decided to give this a try as I saw that the overall rating from viewers was quite high, but this was just okay for me. I kept hoping it would get better as the story progressed but it didn't. It was as if the writers were trying to cram as many silly tropes and cliches into this as they could. This was most likely because there was no depth to the story in terms of the plot. There was way too much faking and lying, and too many unnecessarily difficult situations and predicaments to the point that I felt somewhat annoyed during most of the episodes. I almost gave up watching it several times and I found myself fast forwarding trough some parts of the later episodes so I could hurry and finish it.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14819828,"This was one of the funniest kdramas I've watched and is one of the first kdramas I've saw that kicked off my love of romantic kdramas. Tae-Moo reminds me of the male protagonist in What's Wrong With Secretary Kim? Or maybe a reboot where the boss is super mean to his subordinate. The story begins when heiress Yeong-Seo is forced to go on another boring blind date by her father who wants a marital alliance with the rich cheobol family of Tae-Moo.Yeong-Seo hates the concept of arranged marriages, so she pays Shin-Hari, her middle-class but ""in debt"" best friend a substantial amount of money to go in her place. The ladies have a history of teaming up and finding hilarious ways to sabotage Yeong-Seo's blind dates, scaring the men off. Unfortunately, they meet their match in Tae-Moo, the handsome, super rich president of Go-foods, who unbeknownst to the ladies, happens to be Shin-Hari's ruthlessly focused, work-driven boss. Tae-Moo has also been forced on yet another blind date by his grandfather, who is demanding an heir. Bored and trying to find a way out of getting married, Tae-Moo is caught off-guard by the crazy Shin-Hari, whose outlandish antics amuses him. Only, he believes she's Yeong-Seo. During the date, Shin-Hari realizes Tae-Moo is her boss, and fearing she will be fired from a job she loves if the hoax is discovered, she ups the ante in an effort to ruin the date and escape. Only Tae-Moo is having none of it. By the end of the date he decides he's going to marry Shin-Hari at all costs, believing she is Yeong-Seo. This will not only get his grandfather off of his back, but Shin-Hari is fun to be around and will liven his life up a bit. Except, Shin-Hari brutally rejects his proposal, even complaining that he looks like a pterodactyl, which really ruffles his err, feathers. Now even more determined to have her, Tae-Moo forces Shin-Hari into a contract relationship after discovering she is not really Yeong-Seo, but an imposter. Shin-Hari's life becomes a hell of her own making as she tries to keep away from Tae-Moo only for him to reel her back in.Interestingly, Tae-Moo doesn't realize his own feelings at first, using revenge as a motive for the contract and his grandfather's demands.Now, there is a lot of workplace harassment where Tae-Moo uses his position as president of the company to get what he wants. Tae-Moo is absolutely ruthless, and his antics are cruel to the point where I felt so bad for Shin-Hari. The power balance was completely off, especially since Tae-Moo does not take no for an answer. He really pressures Shin-Hari throughout the series when she refuses him, leaving her a frazzled nervous mess. #metoo much? Tae-Moo said he liked Shin-Hari after their first date because she is honest, but all Shin-Hari does is lie throughout the entire series. Mostly because she is trying to save herself from the mess Yeong-Seo unapologetically gets her in.There is a subplot and romance between Tae-Moo's adopted brother Sung-Moon, who also works as his dutiful right hand man and Secretary. Yeong-Seo falls in love at first sight but Sung-Moon/Mr. Cha wants nothing to do with the girl who tricked his best friend. Actor Kim Min-Kyu is in top form here, and this is one of my favorite roles for him. The ensuing romance between Mr. Cha and Yeong-Seo is adorable and full of hilarious and often embarrassing hijinks throughout.Both ladies, Shin-Hari and Yeong-Seo are cute, adorable and fun. It's easy to see why these two very tightly-wound businessmen fall for their polar opposites.But while this show is a guilty pleasure it is not modern in how the power dynamics play out. You have a boss harassing and forcing a female employee into dating him, vowing to never give up, leaving her terrified to lose her job, and a situation in which a character sleeps with someone when she is too drunk to consent. I was able to suspend modern morals on this for the fictional show and characters.I rate this show high regardless because it has likeable actors who all did a great job, a fun concept, and great characters. Plus its just hilarious and engaging. I definitely enjoyed the series and recommend.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14819828,"This was entertaining enough, but as with many Korean romantic comedies it does get irritating when adults act so immature.The initial mistaken identity premise is more or less dealt with about halfway through, and then we are left with a similar premise to the recent Kdrama Encounter, where a big business owner and an entry level employee must steer their romance through all of the resulting political and social complications. Encounter did it far better, with a much more clever script and with adults acting their age.Having said that, the four main actors/characters are pleasant enough and this is far from the worst Korean romantic comedy series.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14819828,"The love story of a wealthy boss & an ordinary employee. We've seen this type of romance countless times, so I didn't expect Business Proposal to be any different.Nonetheless, despite the obvious plot, we're drawn in by the familiarity. The drama doesn't attempt to conceal its intention to fully exploit all of the cliche elements of a rom-com. It expresses its intent openly & strangely, viewers perceive this openness as a strength rather than a weakness.Another big plus is the fast-paced plot. Shin HaRi's identity is revealed in only four episodes & the characters' backstory is presented in the form of a one-person play, which allows viewers to focus on their chemistry. This kdrama is so easy to enjoy because it lacks the dragging storyline & the typical villains. The fact that it emphasizes comedy over romance helps people focus more on the story. Witty dialogue & cartooning exaggerated situations make for a good laugh.We can't forget about the actors. Kim SeJeong delivered another outstanding performance. Ahn HyoSeop captures the hearts of the viewers with his perfect looks that make him appear to have just stepped out of a webtoon. He's strutting his stuff as Kang TaeMoo, a narcissistic perfectionist who's also clumsy & cute. Needless to say, the chemistry between these two actors is incredible. Of course, Seol InAh's Jin YoungSeo & Kim MinKyu's Cha SungHoon's hot romance will make you want to start dating again. Apart from these four characters, my favorite is Jo YooJung, played by Seo HyeWon. She's the heart of the series' comedic element. Also, as an ARMY, I appreciate the BTS references.However, having reached a tipping point, the final few episodes showed Shin HaRi & Kang TaeMoo's romance took off. Yes, there're cliches, but given the show's unique charms, I found myself thinking, ""So what? It's hilarious."" It maintained a perfect momentum throughout the entire drama. As a result, I believe Business Proposal, along with Our Beloved Summer, will be one of the SBS's well-made romance dramas.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14819828,"Business Proposal is one of the more popular k-dramas right now, and I was curious to see why it has such popularity and high ratings.Firstly, I'm a big fan of Ahn Hyo-Seop with his soulful puppy-eyes and he is a great actor to boot, but this wasn't my favorite of his roles. His character's personality is mostly the same throughout, nothing special and rather boring, with Se-Jeong having much more personality in her character. I thought the overall premise was cute and fun, but I'm glad it was only 12 episodes as anything more would have been dragged out. I liked that the show wasn't afraid to poke fun at the k-drama cliches and make fun of itself at times. The second couple was also cute and I enjoyed both stories.Overall the story is simple and fun and this show is a pure rom-com. I enjoyed it but it didn't blow me away, and I personally like a bit more plot with my shows. It is a easy watch and a good way to become a fan of Hyo-Seop!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14819828,"Korean Drama ""The Business Proposal"" has definitely an old Korean drama feel to it. The romance is light and fluffy, there are enough funny moments between the couple, there is no love triangle, rather, a cute second couple, and there are plenty of trops that were enjoyable to watch.The leading actress, in addition, does a great job with her character and she is another reason to watch this drama for her delightful performance. The rest of the cast gives nice performances as well, but not as energetic as hers. The colors and the whole atmosphere of the drama are bright and light as well.Unfortunately, the series goes downhill towards the ending. The trops feel more and more stale and the story gets boring, to the point when the second couple was probably the only reason to keep watching.So, overall, 5 out of 10, as the first half was fun, but the second part not so much.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A few more breadcrumbs leading up to the plot unfolding, would have been much more enjoyable, especially considering how little they involved the hard work Shin Ha-Ri had done previously. I think that tied in with the two identities being slowly unraveled would have been more entertaining.I feel this show could have been something really amazing had the flow of the overall plot been more planned out, as the last episodes seemed to just be there without much substance.Still is a must watch, as I couldn't wait for more episodes, but toward the end, it wasn't as fulfilling.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

And the slow burn ramp up of the main story line pumped dopamine into my brain. My heart was pounding at times and sometimes it was floating. I feel refreshed and hopeful after the show :)I am a huge fan of the fake dating trope. And the Business Proposal killed it. It had all the aspects of shows that I love:1. A beloved, kind, hardworking, eccentric female lead who is great at her job. Shin Hari is so adorable and earnest.2. Lovable characters. Every character in the show is trying to do good and love in the way they know how.3. Love! Shin Hari is surrounded by love. She has her family that is caring and hilarious. Intergenerational scenes are high key the best type of humor and often feel the most pure and relatable. She has her best friend Jin Youg-seo and these two are tied at the hip supporting each other through highs and lows. They are so funny together and also keep each other in check. But in every relationship, there is so much love, from the coworker relationships, the sibling relationships, the friendships, etc.4. Laughs! This show is so funny and Shin Hari's earnestness results in her getting in all these comedic situations.5. Of course, character development. Most obviously, we see Kang Tae-moo go from being full of himself, to being a little bit toned down. And this is what love does! It changes people!6. Acting. I would go to bat for these actors. I thought they did such a great job with the comedic timing.Like some of the best sitcoms, I felt like I got to watch a slice of life show full of people embracing life in an open way. I think for many, this is what life is all about!AND OK for any h8rs, I also AM personally less into the rich boy, poor girl trope and the protective boyfriend tropes, that are sometimes exhibited here. I do concede there are points where Kang Tae-moo is kind of protective/competitive in a way that is sometimes uncomfortable. But I think for the most part Shin Hari seems super into it and into him.

I love swooning and long gazes, but if kdramas are limiting intimate scenes for some kind of moral authority, why does every show portray drunkenness like it's no big deal?But anyway, those long looks, and fake falling, waving goodbye to each 4th graders and bear hugs when a kiss (even a little peck) would be much more fitting for a romance, well that's getting annoying. No, I'm not suggesting kdramas lose their charm and become Americanized with raunchy or useless intimate scenes, but damn can my two leads do something besides stand 5 feet apart for the first 10 episodes??OK all that ranting aside, this one finally feels like its breaking the mold a little bit. There were still Hella kdrama cliches but it manages to play them out in less goofy ways. I really like that the back up love interests actually got their thing going early and they were very interesting.Lots of aspects of the relationship left unexplored, and a lot OVER done and dragged out but thanks a lot for a little heat and not as many ""long looks, freeze cam"" shots when we really needed to see that intimacy.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt20869502,"Drama itself is excellent. I loved it. But if you watched this subtitled, then you missed at least 30% of the story.Most Koreans wouldn't use English subtitle so they wouldn't know. Most English speaking audience don't understand the audio so they wouldn't know. But I'm Korean-American who lived 25 years in each country. I'm equally fluent in both languages but we turn the subtitle on for our daughter who isn't very good with Korean. And the amount of mistakes I notice is ridiculous. I am 100% certain it was translated by a Korean who never lived in English speaking country.One example is the nickname of Kwon. They translated it to ""Tactician Kwon"". Which is actually a compliment. But the original Korean word used was negative. It should've been ""Plotting Kwon"". Because he always plotting something against someone. There are literally dozens of these wrong translations per episode.Bong Joon-Ho's movies such as Parasite on the other hand are much better. I can tell he spends extra effort making sure translations are perfect. But Netflix Korean shows including Squid Game are horrible.Come on Netflix, there are 1.4 million Korean-Americans who can do better job.",neutral,Drama
tt20869502,"It is very rare for me to review a series before finishing it, but this was so darn delightful that I could not stop myself sharing the good news. After 3 episodes I wrote that if you are not watching this you are missing out. Also that Eun-bin Park is simply wonderful as the autistic attorney at the centre of this drama, coping so movingly with the challenges she faces.Having now watched the whole series my opinion has not changed. This is a joy to watch. All the usual elements of good K drama are here: fine acting, well drawn characters, believable relationships, deft plotting. I could go on: K dramas do so many things well.But the absolute clincher is the performance of Eun-bin Park. She makes us believe in her character's difficulties. But she also makes us believe in her ability to find a path through that does not contradict her autism. You are on her side the whole series through. She managed to convey a character that struggled with emotions but also gave us those emotions. Remarkable. Utterly believable.I am no expert on autism. I have read reviews here from those with experience of the condition both decrying and lauding the accuracy of the portrayal. Perhaps another reviewer got it right when he/she said that the condition is a spectrum, so those with experience can find that it varies considerably.",positive,Drama

tt20869502,"This drama has to be one of the most enjoyable ones I've seen in a while since It's Okay To Not Be Okay. Just basing from the first two episodes, the drama already has so much potential with the theme. The casting is amazing, and I especially love the choices for the female and male lead (who is such a green flag by the way). While it could be said that there were some instances of exaggeration and pacing issues, it still remained as a positive and honest depiction of how autism really is for many who are on the spectrum. Another thing I like about this drama is the honesty. Instead of depicting her as some sort of detached white male savant, her intelligence seems very realistic and according to how human intelligence really does function in real life, unlike some certain depictions of autism in western media. In other words, she's smart and tops her class, but she isn't unrealistically smart.I really hope the creators do this drama much more justice in the rest of the episodes, especially since this drama has so much potential to be on the hall of good K-dramas, especially with the Netflix promo, but with the quality we've seen in the first two episodes, I don't doubt it.",positive,Drama

This show does something very well : Visibility. Not only do you learn a vulgar amount of Whale and Dolphin facts! But it presents a topic that is covered appropriately with the intent to even educate the viewers (autism, amongst other) with a lot of thought and care put into it.. while maintaining the viewer entranced. Still, the way everyone has a role to play and actually matters (as well as some being very likeable, and in the case of the lead, mesmerizing) is what made the show for me.. setting the bar high for any other production of this type. I specially like that even the ""romance"" is well founded/introduced/formed.Although, I have to say that I enjoyed the first 5 episodes the most. After that, there are some slower moments with expected cliches/tropes that (frankly) the series could have done without. Knowing now that there will be a season 2 also helps, because the ending isn't particularly satisfactory and made the story feel a tad incomplete.. or more appropriately, capable of giving more.Can't give it enough praises.. but it would be a shame not to tell others to give this a chance.Easy recommendation!

tt20869502,"So the lead declined the part of the extraordinary lawyer Woo Young Woo because she felt she wasn't ready. And filmed another drama.As a result they didn't seek out another actor but decided to wait and ask again.. this time she accepted.She did her homework on what autism is. Met with a bunch of people and found out how she would portray her And I don't know if it because of that some scenes were altered or if it was there allready but the whole script comes across as genuine, kind and thoughtful.I have seen one other series with her that I know of and the lead is almost unrecognizable. So all I can say is give her the highest international possible for her performance. It puts the majority of performances of people with autism to shame.In the first few episodes a big effort is made to make the viewer aware of autism in general . And the preconceptions they still have to face.So far this has been done in a respectful manner and I hope they continue to do so.I am not a big fan of some of the special effects. Like the thundering steps of the younger son of a family and some other stuff.That is why I can't give it a 10. But I will gladly put that aside while watching the stellar performance of the lead. I am in awe of her appearance.She describes a friend / colleague like the spring sun or was it autumn, the episode with nicknames, a similar strong description befits her.Some cases don't have a happy end. And some do.So I like that. While it feels random, maybe it is. At least I felt that the writers tried their best and maybe that is what life is ... random at times.. sometimes you need luck, or an understanding judge.At the moment I am a bit fearful of the mother daughter storyline.. It has yet to unfold, if the writers did an extraordinarily great job I will adjust my ranking to 10. The reason I am fearful is because of how the father reacted to her when she asked about a customers behavior..
This action is defendable but one I am very conflicted with , so I hope this gets further explored later on.If they botch it up I will lower the current 9..
But even if they messed it up I will gladly continue watching this character grow.Goes into top recommendations together with sky castle.",unknown,Drama

There is a central love story which is written with care and kindness however in general, it glosses over the more difficult aspects of dealing with a relationship with an autistic person. As someone who has immediate family members who are high functioning, I do feel like this show is not realistic in treating the particulars of the disorder.

We have problems with showing them on us / our faces.Also, they are showing a case of Asperger's syndrome. Not all of us have such ""genius"" talents.

The British also lost their edge in human interest story, since Jane Austin era.Back to this show. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed another wonderful KD series.

Not like I can rattle off names of Hollywood stars dating back to Spencer Tracy, Audrey Hepburn, to Tom Hanks, Arnold, etc.My only criticism is that when I was getting all worked up, enjoying a feast, having almost my fill, the show just cuts off.

We lose our wacky clients, and all the courtroom scenes start to repeat whatever our characters were just talking about. I'm not sure I laughed at any point during the last four episodes.As a complete package, Woo is still worth trying -- there's a lot to like, and you might find the second-half transition less jarring than I did.

I just saw the episode where a doctor is asked to prove which injuries were sustained during which particular attack, and his answer is literally ""well I am a doctor"" and everybody went ""well he sure got us there"".....no. Just no.A grown man who falls in love with a person who as a person has only shown herself to be at the level of a 6 year old kid and acts like it to boot. Let's put this one in the highly disturbing bracket.Halfway through the show I couldn't take it any more and quit.As a court room tv show, EAW is not that good. The cases are original, but the way they are handled just are not satisfying in a realistic sense. As a comedy it's not working unless you find laughing at autistic tendencies funny.

tt20869502,"It's rather novel to build a show around a neurodivergent character. Perhaps that's why so much of what life is like for this community was overlooked. It did, however, show particular aspects very well. Other aspects were equally good, such as the law firm rivalry, and the budding romance.One senses American production values throughout. From the persistent - and annoying, background music to the lack of character backstory and development. For instance, how does the love interest know all about ASD? The throwaway line about 'working with disabled' - sure, but then, why did he decide to work in a law firm?That asinine whale sequence every time she had an idea. The first, maybe second episode - okay. But give the viewer - and the actress credit! We could know she was coming up with an idea, without whales flipping out of the water every time.In all, this story has a lot of unexplored potential. Still, I won't be watching the second series.

tt20869502,"This is a simply marvelous series with an astonishing performance by Park Eun-bin. The show began with diminutive ratings in Korea on a minor cable channel but reached stratospheric ratings because of word of mouth and was widely popular on Netflix internationally. It's a gem of a 10 and I say this as someone who tries to combat ratings inflation.Autism has been captured by a number of Korean shows, most notably The Good Doctor (remade in Japan and the United States) and It's Okay to Not Be Okay. In both of these, as in Extraordinary Attorney Woo, the focus is on relatively high-functioning individuals and the writers have to be careful not to minimize the effect of the social awkwardness and lack of awareness that is commonly encountered among autistic individuals. All three shows occasionally stray in this regard, but overall they do extraordinary work in evoking understanding and sympathy without descending into maudlin pity.In Extraordinary Attorney Woo, Park portrays a young woman whose tremendous memory and strong character helps her to have great success at university and law school and to become the first autistic lawyer to pass the notoriously tough Korean bar examination. Despite finishing at the top of her class, she is unable to get a job at any law firm, due to the routine prejudice she encounters. Nevertheless, through the intervention of her father, who was a classmate of the (female) senior partner of a leading firm, she is hired out of the ordinary hiring cycle and begins work on a series of cases that form the basis for ever episode (one story takes place over two episodes). The show also depicts Park's interactions with her colleagues and clients, with opposing counsel, and with judges, all of whom have to adjust to dealing with the extra-normal behaviors of an autistic individual. Some do better than others.The cases that Park and her colleagues must deal with are engaging. They repeatedly show how rarely anything in life is black and white. In one episode, a North Korean defector is accused of robbing a woman who owed her money but the woman's injuries turn out to be much more likely to have been caused by her abusive husband; in another, Park must help a community resist the building of a road that will cut a village in half in the service of a housing development, where the alternatives are either impractical or much more expensive. Perhaps the least realistic is the case where Woo defends a somewhat delusional young man, the son of the founder of one of the notorious cram schools to which even quite young Korean children get sent after school to give them an edge in getting into college and where they have to spend innumerable hours after their regular school, deprived of play time and even food and sleep. The defendant hijacks a bus that is supposed to take the children to school. He announces that that he is the leader of the Children's Liberation Army and takes them to a local nature spot where they are told to have fun and be healthy. But while that case is not very realistic, the issues that are raised are very much on point and must have struck a nerve in Korea; it made for one of the most enjoyable episodes of the show.Generally, while the trials are inevitably compressed as demanded by the format of the show, the writer, Mon Ji-won, has done a pretty good job of showing the kinds of ethical dilemmas so often faced by lawyers where the demands of truth and justice can conflict with their duty to robustly defend and advance their clients' interest. I also liked the often nuanced way the judges in the show ruled on gnarly questions with which they were faced.Before speaking about Park Eun-bin, a word of praise for an absolutely outstanding supporting cast. Much attention has been paid to Park's romantic interest, Lee Joon-ho, played by the dishy and sympathetic Kang Tae-oh, but the breakout performance here is from Joo Hyun-young as Dong Geu-ra-m, playing Park's best friend with comic and joyful freshness. Shout-outs too to the actors playing the lawyers at Hanbada, the law firm where Park works, Kang Ki-young as Jung Myung-seok, Park's mentor, Baek Ji-won as Han Seon-young, the CEO of Hanbada who was so memorable in Be Melodramatic (2019, the gorgeous Ha Yoon-kyung playing Park's classmate Choi Soo-yeon, and Joo Jong-hyuk as Kwon Min-woo, a straitlaced and less than loveable colleague who approaches his unusual colleague with an uncomfortable combination of envy and arrogance. Others, too numerous to mention, contribute recurring roles and cameos that will stay with you.Now to Park's performance: It's just wonderful. Her mannerisms, her slightly unfashionable dress and hairstyle, her off-kilter way of thinking about her cases, her (occasionally hilariously) straightforward way of dealing with others, all work perfectly. She conveys her character with enormous charm and she overcomes the challenges of the role with grace and, judging from her public statements, humility. You just can't take your eyes off her. I would guess that the public will not be satisfied with a single season; I certainly will not and there are, thankfully, reports that a second season will come in 2024.",positive,Drama

I do wish their two examples of autism weren't so extreme, but there's also an extreme difference in these two characters showing that it's a spectrum. Her speeches about autism are very heartfelt and relatable along with her recent exposure and reaction to discrimination showing we are just as capable as anyone else and wish people would realize that; going as far to show how we can be rejected for who we are as long as we share the same trait as someone entirely different from us, a relatable experience for all.

tt20869502,"Before I get to the critique part, I just want to say that I love this show, I think it's brilliant and the lead actor is truly exceptional! It is one of the best representations I have seen of an Autistic character, but with caveats (below). Probably the best I have actually seen is Asa Butterfield's character in the film ""X+Y"".However... as the parent of a gifted Autistic son with similar IQ as the main character, who is at University aged 14, I can say there is quite a lot wrong with the representation of Autism here. This depiction is filled with clichèd stereotypes. It's as though she has taken every trait any individual Autistic person has ever experienced and put them into one person. That's not how it works; it's very much a spectrum, and each individual experiences this neurodivergence differently (and differently at different times). This performance is very exaggerated, particularly in the light of the fact that such high IQ Autistic individuals often hugely compensate with their intellect, and also develop very good masking ability. This is especially true of females on the spectrum; they often present quite differently and are sometimes not diagnosed until significantly later as a result... even more so when they are profoundly gifted like this character. The fact that she is completely 'out' with her Autism (not the diagnosis itself so much, but the physical manifestations) would be highly unusual; there is an expectation that people conform to the 'norm' in society, and I shouldn't think that's so different in South Korea.That being said, I understand it may not have had the same impact or humour had they made the characterisation more subtle, and whilst the manifestations themselves are largely exaggerated (at least while she's in public), they are truthful aspects of what it is like to be Autistic. The lead actor's delivery and timing is superb, the rest of the cast are excellent, and the show is a complete joy.",positive,Drama

I find the series to be an amazing depiction, unlike people such as user ""juliemasilko"" who so incorrectly called it ""Aspergers spectrum,"" and completely overlooked the fact that. Wow, it's a spectrum.I personally can function somewhat normally in my everyday life. Do a lot of hand motions while walking, I ""cower"" in music, and hyperfixate on many things, all of which neurotypicals may find strange. But it doesn't bother me. I avoid public travelling and have many minor nitpicks of my own that make it, well, a ""disorder.""My special interest is zoology and art. It's absolutely a relief to see special interests explored in Extraordinary Attorney Woo, as it's a big part of autism spectrum.It often defines our future and is also very often something that we learn with ease.

tt20869502,"The literal Korean to English translation of the title of this TV show can be read as: Strange lawyer U-Yeong-U. Like this, U-Yeong-U can be described as extraordinary or strange, depending on your perspective.This show was in the centre of a lot of attention which meant controversies couldn't be avoided towards the depiction of an individual with autism. One of the biggest criticism it faced was the unrealistic depiction of the main character U-yeong-U who had an extraordinary intelligence and the characters around her, who were perhaps more understanding and friendly than in reality. Despite these criticisms, I believe that the actors did an amazing job in playing the characters who were not just either right or wrong but somewhere between which definitely added a lot more depth to each individual characters. Even if some people question the realness of the characters and their interactions, there is no doubt that this TV show increased the awareness of autism itself, and set the standard of how people should interact with individuals with autism; with a caring and understanding mindset.",neutral,Drama
tt20869502,"I am a huge fan of ""The Good Doctor"" which airs on US network TV. It stars Freddie Highmore as a brilliant surgeon, and who is also on the spectrum. It is based on a Korean show and interestingly during the 22/23 season there is an episode that's got a lawyer on the spectrum.Anyway, this is a KDrama about an attorney on the spectrum. It is quirky and at times overly sentimental. It's more of a comedy than The Good Doctor.Each episode is 60 minutes long.I watched this in the original Korean with English subtitles.At first I found it a bit silly. But around episode four all of a sudden I realized I was really enjoying it. There was a lot going on that included decent character development.The lead character is played by an incredibly talented actress. Like Freddie Highmore's role, Woo is very high functioning and a savant.But the other characters are good too.

tt20869502,"I wrote a review before, just after the release of the show on Netflix. I deleted it afterwards, as I thought that it would be too premature. But having reached the last two episode of this season, I think it is safe now to write a proper and honest review.As someone on the autism spectrum, I am glad that there is increasing awareness and interest in people on the spectrum. Although we still have a long way to go - negative stereotypes and prejudice against autistic people are still rife - I believe that being objective, making a careful approach and actually talking and listening to people who are on the spectrum could help create more understanding, as well as a more nuanced image of autism.I have read that Extraordinary Attorney Woo has become such a hit, probably because of the main character who is on the spectrum. But it's not the first show that revolves around a character with autism who is treated as someone with equal potential - rather than a ""lesser being"" as often portrayed in media. Although not explicitly mentioned, the main character of the Swedish/Danish crime series hit 'Bron/Broen' ('The Bridge') is a female homicide detective who is on the spectrum. Does the name Saga Norén ring a bell? Other shows include Sorjonen, a Finnish crime series, which revolves around a special police detective who also displays high-functioning autism-like behaviours. But without going any further off topic, I will now focus on Extraordinary Attorney Woo.Park Eun-bin deserves praise for her careful approach: she stated that she did not want to offend people who are on the spectrum, and she did research by consulting specialists who work in the field before she metaphorically sculpted Woo Young-woo out of marble. However, did she meet with people with autism spectrum disorder? This is a main concern. I could not help noticing some of the strange movements and behaviours Woo Young-woo exhibits. I know Park Eun-bin created the character from scratch with the guidance of the specialists she consulted, but does it actually represent someone with autism? From her ""stimming"" (typical mannerisms often seen in people with autism spectrum disorder), to her strange way of walking, her vast encyclopedial knowledge of particularly whales and dolphins, her perfect eidetic memory, her ability to read and comprehend vast amounts of written material in a short period of time, her specific inflexibilities, to her pedantic and often monotonous speech, among other things. These traits are common among autistic people, but apart from the latter, they manifest in such a way that it gives non-autistic viewers the wrong impression that everyone on the spectrum does like Young-woo does. And it would be a disappointment when people on the spectrum do not meet the expectations that the non-autistic, neurotypical audience will have of (high-functioning) autistic people.My point is that many things about Young-woo look exaggerated and unnatural, and if I have to be blunt, are totally unnecessary. And even though Park Eun-bin never intended Young-woo to be anywhere stereotypical, the truth is that she actually is. But does it hurt our feelings as people on the spectrum? It leans towards a 'no'. I believe Young-woo is a departure from the Rain Man trope that has been rife in media when it comes to the subject of autism. This is a good thing. But a more subtle, more realistic portrayal of an autistic person means having to imitate an actual person or character who is on the spectrum. From experience, I know plenty of people on the spectrum who are not quick (or avid) readers, and people who are forgetful, or who excel at sports. Park Eun-bin did excellent work being original, I am sure, but unfortunately at the cost of being realistic. It may have helped if she had open-hearted talks and discussions with actual people on the spectrum to help shape Young-woo. Or she could have just watched a couple of seasons of 'The Bridge' and learn a bit from Saga Norén. But not imitate her, of course.However, it would be too one-sided and somewhat unempathetic if I were to stick with my critique. Extraordinary Attorney Woo is NOT The Bridge (the latter would be too dark for a light-hearted drama). Young-woo is NOT Saga Norén (the latter would have been too honest and too blunt). And Europe/Scandinavia is NOT Korea (two entirely different cultures). Judging from what I have read, the show is considered daring and fresh as it takes on as a major theme what is deemed to be a 'disability' in Korea. Apparently, people with (mental) disabilities are hidden from Korean society: they are undesirable, and 'should remain invisible'. This could be the reason why Park Eun-bin could not interact with people on the spectrum, because these people themselves may not wish to reveal themselves as such - in fear of social stigma. But this is just conjecture, as I honestly don't know. But in the show, certain attitudes towards people with ""disabilities"" that are depicted reflect the real world. I was intrigued by the epilogue of the third episode, in which Young-woo provided us with a rather sobering revelation about Hans Asperger - after whom the Asperger's Syndrome was named - and his work with the Nazi regime during the Second World War. Her point: an autistic person - high-functioning or not, is never inferior to any other human being.It must have been difficult to produce a TV show that is light-hearted, that also holds a mirror in front of society, but without misrepresenting the people who are on the spectrum. It is difficult to get rid of certain stereotypes, as these stereotypes make potential viewers - whether or not on the spectrum - curious enough to watch the show. I understand that some of the exaggerations and unnecessary features of Young-woo I mentioned earlier may have been necessary in order to maintain light-heartedness and create a charming aura around the main character. I also understand that people dote on her because of her charm and innocence, but it absolutely should NOT be a distraction to the bitter reality that actual people on the spectrum experience every day. Like Young-woo, although highly gifted and full of good intentions, people who are ""different"" are treated as such.Extraordinary Attorney Woo is not perfect. I agree with that. I believe the official reviews have pointed that out. But it is much better than the Rain Man trope we have been served far too often: the lowly, care-demanding savant who is bound to his or her caregiver. And although Young-woo is not as realistic as Saga Norén, we have to keep in mind that being too serious or being too realistic about the subject would put viewers off. So you will have to take liberties in order to make potential viewers curious and watch the show, and that is exactly what Extraordinary Attorney Woo has done. And even though it is a first in Korea, I hope it will be a start for more TV shows that address mental health and social issues. Creating awareness is one of the purposes of television, apart from entertainment, and because of the huge popularity of K-drama worldwide, I hope there will be more A-dramas in the future (pun intended). And it does not have to be exclusively autism: ADHD, anxiety disorder or even anorexia nervosa may be relevant subject matters.I apologise for the long read, but I hope it was worth it.",neutral,Drama

I think the writers did a superb job of getting the message across but luckily they had an actress in Park Eun-Bin who totally owned the role and perfectly trod the line between entertainment and education. The support cast do a sterling job and overall it is a most enjoyable story.

tt20869502,"I first heard about Park Eun Bin (lead actress of Extraordinary Attorney Woo) that she was filming Extraordinary Attorney Woo a few months after The King's Affection (Eun Bin's previous Netflix historical drama) ended.The thought of Eun Bin playing a role of a lawyer didn't surprise me for I know she's an A+ lister Korean actress who definitely knows how to pick her roles and script.SIMPLICITY: I appreciate the simplicity of how the scenes are all shot for each character and the entire episodes. I love how they used child friendly illustrations and special effects of whales everytime Atty. Woo would talk about them. Aside from that, I find it interesting to see a special effect of the documents that appear on Atty. Woo's mind whenever she tries to recall some articles found on the South Korean law. I also love the cover design when the preview for the next episode is about to be shown at the end of every episode.CASTING: I believe this drama has a very good casting director who knows that every actor and actress working for this drama suited their roles completely. To be specific, Eun Bin definitely nailed her role as a lawyer who has an autistic spectrum. Tae Oh also proved to us that he is a real life Jun Ho who is very gentle, kind and charming throughout the drama because he showed love and support for Atty. Woo in every step of the way. The other Hanbada lawyers such as Atty. Jung, Atty. Su Yeon, and Atty. Min Woo also did a great job in their roles to think that they represented what rookie lawyers should be was done accurately because they showed how passionate they are in their job as lawyers. Jeon Bae-Su playing the role of Atty. Woo's father did an amazing job of portraying a single father who endures the challenges of raising a child who has an autistic spectrum all his life. On the other hand, Jin Kyung as Tae Su Mi is also a brilliant idea because she brilliantly and clearly depicted a mother who left her child and lover away for her own convenience and reputation.INSPIRING: This drama teaches us to believe in the capability of people despite the fact of having a disability. No disability can hinder a person from achieving success in life. I also learned how important it is to accept the responsibility as a mother and not to leave a child behind for one's own gains and reputation. We shouldn't use power to be above the law, rather we must abide the laws and be a responsible citizen. More importantly, love is unconditional. May it be a love of a father to a child who has a disability, a love of a man without a disability to a woman who has a disability.... the most important thing is there is genuine love, care and support with one another to achieve success and true happiness in life.Extraordinary Attorney Woo is a 10/10 for me.

tt20869502,"I wrote this review for episode 10 but thought I'd put it on the whole series as this episode epitomises what the series is trying to achieve.I had a few reservations about this show and how it handled some of the more delicate matters of autism. The first was that it might romanticise the condition but it showed a more severe case and noted that autism is on a spectrum so it doesn't shy away from explaining it in full.I thought it was inappropriate for her to have a love interest with someone more advanced emotionally who could take advantage, she doesn't want to even hold hands so would a physical relationship not be right and whether this applies to the 'victim' and Attorney Woo and how their different situations mean what level of relationship they can have. And they handled that well and educated me on it too. Watching episode 10 I was actually waiting to see what the arguments would be. I'm usually someone who has an opinion and awaits to see if what I'm watching is inline but with this I was waiting to learn.I really like that it wasn't black and white in this episode and how I was against the mother at first but then saw her point as the victim became more fragile and even though she was harsh to woo she made some good points.You don't usually expect this level of thought provoking and balance on a law drama even if it is based around autism.It's all very fascinating and I think the point is that there isn't one right answer, certainly not one that applies to autism as a whole but not even to a single particularly person.I think ultimately it was right for the man to go to jail and I guess the difference is between the victims relations and Woo's is that Woo wanted to and initiated the kiss. On the other hand he's literally teaching her how to kiss but not in the same way a teenager learns as that's instinctual. Honestly I'm not sure about Woo's relationship but I still think the show is handling the topic well.It's a great show that handles her condition sensitively and compassionately.It's not preachy and just explains it very naturally. In the west it would have been handled very insensitively if it was done several decades ago or too preachy and black and white if done now. Somehow South Korea even with its cultural issues with mental health have actually managed to nail it better than I've seen anyone else do it.South Korea have come along way in terms of technology and living standards but it seems their emotional intelligence and open mindedness is on on accelerated path too so that they catch up with and overtake western countries handling of mental health in the not too distant future.",positive,Drama

The protagonist is shown to have very severe autistic traits (extreme clumsiness, never looking into people's eyes, being unable to control herself in what topics to bring up, talking about whales all time, etc.) while at the same time, she is shown to be a genius. People on the spectrum whose behaviour is so extreme in adulthood would usually have a low IQ in real life, while individuals with a higher IQ (I'm not talking about being a genius, only average or higher) might still exhibit some characteristic behaviour but would, as a rule, come across as only slightly quirky or weird, while some autistic individuals learn to completely mask their behaviour to match 'neurotypicals', especially in some situations (e.g. A job interview, where the protagonist's behaviour is shown to be completely outrageous here).If you want to watch this because you are interested in autism, I recommend watching Love on the Spectrum instead, with real-life people on the autism spectrum, both lower and higher IQ individuals.",negative,Drama

(Crash Landing on You, Our Blues, Hometown Cha Cha Cha, Vincenzo, Squid Game, Start-Up, King Dom, Hi Bye Mama!, Mad for Each Other, Mr. Sunshine, My Sassy Girl and many other KDRAMAS and KMOVIES). I hope episode 5 thru 16 will be as good as first four episodes.So far each episode represented different cases for attorney Woö to solve them. If you like comedy, heart warming, romance and mild violence. If this show does great thru all episodes, hopefully there be Season 2. This show is a must for you!

tt20869502,"8 Episodes in and I'm captivated on so many levels . If your someone who believes a TV program can inform , inspire , innovate and influence the watcher look no further than Extraordinary Attorney Woo . I come away feeling just that little bit better about humanity . Thank you to all concerned .. exceptional.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"I don't usually write movie reviews, but I have to write them here, so that many people out there watch this masterpiece show.Extraordinary Attorney Woo, as the title suggests, Extraordinary. Every aspect of this film is truly extraordinary. This is the only TV series out of the many Korean TV series that have been aired, which makes it hard for me to forget them and switch to another TV series. So I've summarized what I love about this show.First, The main theme. About ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). I know about this very little, and I learned a lot through this series. A theme that is rarely raised by various tv series from any country. Coupled with the story about the trial with the first autistic lawyer in the Republic of Korea. So different, unique, but inspiring and heartwarming at the same time. This will make people realize that Autism people are human and want to be loved and cared for. Thank you very much to the director and writer for bringing up this story.Second, The Acting. I want to take my hat off to Park Eun Bin (as Woo Young Woo), the level of her acting is on par with the Oscars. I was once a volunteer at an orphanage for children with autism. Gestures, expressions, gazes, body language, language structure, which are acted out are 100% exactly the same as what I've ever seen. I think this is her best acting and best performance during her career as an actress. I also want to appreciate Kang Tae Oh (as Lee Jun Ho), his acting is able to express a deep love for Woo Young Woo, sincerely without being made up. The expressions and gazes shown are truly mesmerizing and every word that comes out is very sweet. This is very rare to find in real life, LOL. Also with Kang Ki Young (as Jung Myeong Seok), wonderful acting and performances with his own story. I really hope they get an award, but hopefully Hollywood will recognize them. Since this show is a tv series, hopefully there will be nominations from the Golden Globes / Emmys.Third, The Visual Effects. I remember Coldplay's music video for Up & Up, the visuals for the music video are amazing and eye-catching. Lots of flying whales and other objects that make us imagine higher. As soon as I watched this show, I immediately remembered Coldplay, it's very different for a tv series and the visuals are very warm, imaginative, and very smooth. Kudos to South Korea, it's on par with Hollywood.I also like each case that is told in each different episode. A lot of the story takes place in real life, and I love the unique way Woo Young Woo and law firm Hanbada solve each case. I also like Woo Young Woo's circle of friends and life who want to befriend, accept, and protect Woo Young Woo at all costs, hopefully with this series, many people will realize that Autism people need to be loved.Every time I watch a TV series, no matter how good the story is, I never give a standing ovation, but only this show I unconsciously give a standing ovation while crying. To anyone of you reading this review, PLEASE WATCH this beautiful tv series.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,As a mom with a grown daughter with similar diagnosis.... I cried so many tears the first couple of episodes. Then...more tears of joy in the next few.

tt20869502,"I have watched some korean series (like six or seven) and i kinda have a good time with them, but there´s always that something that doesn´t make me aprecciate the Korean series that much. It´s always ok... ok... ok... and just that. There was this one series (apart from Squid Game) called Extracurricular that was in my opinion the best one among all i´ve seen. And I thought i will never find something else. Until Woo Young Woo came... and conquer after just one episode.Now i´ve watched 10 episodes and I still enjoy it a lot. It´s not like it´s impressive the storyline, but what it has to offer, it delivers perfectly. Kudos to the main actress.",neutral,Drama

tt20869502,"I think it was a well made series- but it seemed like no one (the authors and producers or directors) had done enough research on autism. It ruined my experience because it was very hard not to get annoyed and insulted on behalf of the misunderstood autistic. First thing I noticed is:
It's not a typical trade that autistic people moves and walks in a funny way! It looks cute when the heroine makes her funny little dance like walk, arms fluttering about. And her cute little face with her eyes moving about like a sweet little cartoon. Yes, autistic people often doesn't like to have direct eye contact - but they don't make funny little expressions all the time! On the contrary, very often they are expressionless. Very stiff and awkward moving about. They don't do funny little dances and moves. They often stay very still!Second :The heroine is really cute and sweet like a child and so innocent that it almost feels like the hero's interest in her is a bit unhealthy. I am not saying autistic people doesn't have romantic feelings, but maybe they could have toned down the sweet innocence.The two issues bugged me so much and it was hard to distract from.I used to work with autistic people and I have a very soft spot for them. I have never seen them moving so much and fluttering their arms, eyes and heads around. On the contrary they can often be so selfconcious or feeling awkward they were stiff as a tree. And they don't seems like a small child, sexless and asexual beings.It reminded me of The Good Doctor in the way the autistic is portrayed. Some things are right on the spot- other things are just stupid. I hate the way The Good Doctor talkes like an inconsistent robot! And I hate the way this one dances her little funny walk. NO NO NO! Give the autistic their pride and dignity back! Don't turn them into cute pixels!",negative,Drama
tt20869502,"Really good at first, but the storyline for every episode is really expected already. To the point that I skip the most part in the beginning until the middle part.",negative,Drama
tt20869502,"What an incredible show. 10 minutes in and I'm rolling my eyes at what I thought was a generic k-dramedy. 30 minutes in though, I was intrigued. By the end of the episode, I was hooked and in love with Attorney Woo. Little did I expect that the following episodes added just further depth, amusement and moments where I literally had tears running down my face. The acting as at times a bit OTT but that just adds to the charm or this show. I'm fascinated to know where the show will go and have my fingers crossed that it continues to deliver so beautifully.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"The program does not exaggerate much, but it does show the general picture of what an autistic person goes through on a day-to-day basis. My granddaughter has a high IQ and is going to University to be a Film Producer. She watches The Good Doctor ant this program, and she actually tells me what Woo is going to do next. Woo counts to 5 to go through doors, and she does not like touches or hugs, my granddaughter is the same way. Woo thinks about whales, and my granddaughter thinks about game figures. So each individual has an escape gate. Great show and I know it will only be 16 episodes. I wish it to be more, at least another 16.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"Eun-bin Park is unbeatable. I don't really enjoy autism friendly shows, they seem too irrelevant. But Eun-bin and her show never fail to use her disability to reveal universal issues we can all relate to. As a result my wife and I are hooked, and we can't help marveling at everything from the writing to the artistic direction. This show is far more than just clever, it's a revelation. My only concern is that its incredibly enchanting lead may be pressured to do this role for the rest of her career.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"This was almost perfect! Twenty Five Twenty One was right below this as the best two KDRAMAs released in 2022 and even though i would almost watch anything with Kim Tae-Ri, Park Eun-Bin continues to surprise me with outstanding performances. These two are real actresses, not just the dolled up Korean women placed ahead of them because they look like models. What a performance and i think they can get away with one more season but please stop after second season. I enjoyed Yoon-Kyeong Ha (Su-Yeon), especially how she supported Attorney Woo throughout. All supporting cast was on the mark, even the mean attorney who tried to turn nice at the end, he played his part very well. When Su-Yeon cried or had a sad or happy part you felt it so either she is super great at acting or it's her real heart. I would guess somewhere in the middle but the guy that gets her in real life will be smiling every day. I intend to watch her in the future.American television or streaming services, this is one of the many quality Korean productions. Netflix is smart in outsourcing these programs because Americans would screw them up. Why is our television so screwed up and can't produce anything close to this quality? Someone please tell me!!",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"This drama absolutely blew me away. I started watching it with low expectations but it got better and better and a few episodes in I couldn't stop watching. I binged the whole show in just a few daysThe story is beautiful. I loved the romance between young woo and jun ho, and i fell in love with all the characters. All the characters had so much depth and personality, even the smaller characters. This show really touched me in a way I wasn't expecting it to and it made me feel happy watching it.Korea definitely knows how to make amazing and unique shows. I would really love to see a season 2.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"Loved the first couple of episodes where the life of an autistic person is captured and showed so well. The acting did seem a bit over the top but that was expected considering the role was unique. Main issue was the continuous under lying theme of weak or morally corrupt male characters. Would have been perfect if they did not have to use this to promote the female lead(s).Even without showing men as such vile or weak beings, the main character's struggles and eventual overcoming of these challenges would've successfully delivered the main plot.Truly hope that this negative portrayal of male characters which is becoming so common these days does not continue. Very good ideas and stories are getting mangled to drive home points which frankly are not required to tel great stories like these.",negative,Drama
tt20869502,"Extraordinary Attorney Woo is a beautifully crafted show with a gripping storyline, yet the acting is incredibly professional and realistic, depicting the notable experiences of an autistic attorney working at a major law firm in South Korea whilst having to face the prejudice of society.The drama is fantastic in many ways. One of the biggest reasons why it's a must-watch is its episodic nature. For the past couple of weeks, I've been craving episode after the other, wondering what happens next - yes, it's entirely addictive and enjoyable to watch. Each episode is a new law case the main character Woo Young-Woo has to work on, as well as showing further progression in Woo Young-Woo's character. Not only is the plot easy to follow, but has a refreshing flair to it, one that is light-hearted, unique, and sends a great message about how society should support and treat those physically or mentally disabled equally, and despite someone's dysfunctions, people should have each other's backs instead of bringing each other down.My favorite part of this drama is Woo Young Woo's adorable relationship with Lee Jun-Ho. It is paced very well throughout the show. Park Eun-bin (Woo Young-Woo) has a forte in playing the part and demonstrated adeptness in her ability to master difficult lines and autistic representations. Adding to it, the cherry on the cake is Kang Tae-oh's character (Lee Jun-Ho). From normalizing Woo's obsession with whales to loving her despite knowing that she might not be able to love him back in a quintessential way, Lee Jun-Ho is a walking GREEN FLAG MAN. (This man got my standard so high! Ugh!)With these two characters, Kang Ki-young as Jung Myung-Seok also stole the show with his impeccable acting.Overall, Extraordinary Attorney Woo can be easily ranked as one of the best K-dramas of the year. It leaves you happy, heartbroken, feeling empathy and not pity for an autistic key character. If you haven't watched it yet, I'd recommend spacing it out and watching it one day at a time to truly enjoy the experience.",neutral,Drama
tt20869502,"This is really a good drama. The actors were really good. One time watchable drama. You will like atleast first 5 episodes after that it's become repeatative same go to court take case , argue and again same. I mean I'm expecting some suspense atleast because it is a court drama.Anyways the thing is some unrealistic scenes happens in this drama like when autism person joined for the job that to as a fresher who will give straight away the case don't you think they need some training. Any normal person will think like that. Before giving any cases to her atleast you people would have shown us how she is become the capable personality to handle those cases. I understand you want to show her as a intelligent but still for me it doesn't fit well. And I don't know many thing about autism person how they behave but somewhere I felt bad for others people not for her.The one think I liked in this drama is male lead!!!!!",negative,Drama

Terrible directing.Had potential but lost.Fairy tale drama - not close to reality.Completed waiting for a good ending but unfortunately none. Not worth your time. Trust me.The leading male does not know how to act - cannot cry.. just opens his mouth and smiles trying to look good.They used autism go generate views but this is painful to watch.Go check honest reviews from Google.100% from rotten is really rotten.Don't be fooled by the high ratings - there are other series worth your time.,negative,Drama

tt20869502,"Yes, the music is as saccharine as in many Korean dramas, and yes, the budding romance is only missing plush toys in the background... get over it. This is glorious, life-affirming stuff. Woo is beautifully acted and directed with flair. It is laugh-out-loud funny and has you rooting for the eponymous lead from the first moment as she copes with her personal challenges. The depiction of a high function autistic is authentic and not glossed-over. One recalls Rainman, where Hoffman played an HFA/savant who was less able to cope with modern society. You may have also watch The Good Doctor in which a similar character blazes his own trail in the medical profession, but without charm. Neither of those is a patch on Woo and it is down to the performance of Park Eun-Bin, a performance that will make you watch everything else she does.",positive,Drama
tt20869502,"I am a bit of a KD fan and this show is faultless. Other reviewers have rightly praised. Park Eun-bin, whose performance is faultless, may I say 'extraordinary'?Can I also acknowledge. Kang Ki-young (Attorney Jung) - in other dramas and comedies his over-acting was very annoying, but here he was much more mature befitting his character.Some, very few, shows punch the heart, not just because of the quality but because you know the last episode is looming.Korean TV and Netflix commissions continue to amaze me. The writing quality is of the highest order... perhaps because they do not talk down to the viewer.I can understand if they produce another series featuring Attorney Woo, but in a way I hope they don't.

tt20869502,"""The Extraordinary Attorney/Weird Lawyer Woo Young Woo"" series is a Beautiful Binge Worthy series that breaks the preconceived notions of what an Autistic/Disabled Person can Achieve and contribute in society when given the opportunity. Granted, the main character is an Autistic Savant aka Law Genius, which she gravitated to since childhood when her very first words were quoting the legal description of assault and battery. Lol..
The challenges she has to overcome are not that much different from the average person that is starting a new job in a new environment. Woo Young Woo may have some additional difficulty due to her disability but for the most part her experiences are completely relatable.The show is entertaining, Heart warming, charming, funny, romantic, and even Educational. The ""Real Genius"" of a show like this is the fact that it has the ability to affect societies perception of people who have disabilities without having to preach to them.Park Eun-bin as Woo Young Woo, does an incredible job portraying the lead character. Her subtle quirks remind you of the challenges she has to overcome just to get thru the most basic things we might take for granted throughout the day, like walking into a room.Overall, the Creators and Writers of this series have done a Wonderful Job showing the main character's development as she continues to grow through each and every experience. In fact, all of the Actors on the Cast do a Great Job that allows you to feel the chemistry during their scenes together.Make Sure You Don't Miss This Gem Of A Show! It's A Must Watch..

""Goblin"" is an example of this, as the maturation of talented writer Kim Eun-Sook blends with nuanced directing, breathtaking cinematography and the formidable acting skills of Gong Yoo and the rest of the stellar cast.This is great art and great television, regardless of the country of origin.

tt5994364,"Goblin is by far one of the best Korean dramas in recent years and this can be seen from its record breaking ratings for a cable TV channel. Goblin,also known as Dokkaebi, is a drama with the main themes of fantasy,romance and melodrama with a tinge of action and comedy. It is about a Goblin called Kim Shin and a nameless Grim Reaper who are connected to each other by their past without them knowing at the start. Other main characters include Ji Eun Tak who is the Goblin's bride, Yu Deok Hwa, and Sunny who is the Grim Reaper's love interest.Despite some parts being lengthy and bland, it was needed as the viewers have to know the background story between the main characters in their past lives. The story is a beautiful and heartwarming one where sacrifices have to be made like how Eun Tak must pull out the sword in Kim Shin's chest in order to save herself but kill Kim Shin in the process. In the end, it was Kim Shin who forced Eun Tak to pull out the sword due to a dangerous situation(See Ep 13) and as a result, he managed to save Eun Tak by sacrificing himself.Besides the main story, there is also the story between the Grim Reaper and Sunny and the interaction between the two of them is often amusing and funny. The ""bromance"" between the Grim Reaper and Goblin is also worth noting as it highlights the impressive chemistry between the two.Bottom line: Goblin is a must-watch for all Kdrama starters as it has all the ingredients for a good drama. There's a reason why it's rated 9.0 by IMDb.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Pretty much everything is perfection, flawless casting, flawless acting , amazing story, some of the most epic & most emotional moments in TV history.

Usually the drama will have good start but bad ending or the other way around. But goblin makes sense on what happened to each of the characters. I love the actors and the supporting actors. Many bashed Ji Eun Tak saying that she is not pretty, but I cannot think of any one for that role that would fit for the character than her.

I did not for one single second buy into the romantic relationship between the pair, and I didn't want to. Not only is Eun-Tak 19yrs old and still in high school, she's extremely immature which really impacted the vibe. Thankfully Gong Yoo's Kim Shin doesn't come across as skeevy; he seems more like a long-suffering older brother. Given that their 'great love' is a main plot point, it really fell flat for me. Thank goodness everything is was very well done. I laughed a lot, teared up a little and really enjoyed how ambitious the whole production was.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The hero comes out as aloof at best and even cruel to her at worst. I couldn't feel the pull between them and couldn't belive it when they said they were in love. At this point, all the poetic balderdash started sounding pretentious.
But there is something really unforgivable: The writer cheats. She delivers a story that leaves the initial problems unsolved and presents them with new ones that are, in my opinion, even worse.
The only good thing about this show was the bromance between the goblin and the angel of death was, but I still felt like I had wasted my time. I think people rated this show so high blinded by the gorgeus setting and the charismatic Gong Yoo, whose frame in a turtleneck is quite something to watch.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The highs and lows of this show are formidable, because as much as this was a tragedy, it was also a show of the triumph of love, and most surprisingly of all, it was at times laugh out loud funny. The love/hate relationship between the Goblin and the Grim Reaper was unbelievably funny and heartwarming to watch. I can say with my whole heart that this is one of those stories that is life-changing to watch.

It is just one of his hobbies among pretending to read books, buying expensive art, and calligraphying some names or silly letters that are supposed to be poetic. It is just sad that the lead male is not better designed. That may explain the problem with acting, he seems to have difficulties in developing the character. A human living that long, endorsed with powers, would probably be insane rather than blue. He is too rational and earthly, it doesn't fit. He should have been obsessed with his never coming bride-death, stalking and fetishizing her somehow before getting to know and love her. He should have been more badass too. Instead he is like a papa in middle age crisis-melancholy.
The girl on the other hand is too pink considering her sad back story. Her childishness is way exaggerated and her cuteness is annoying. But she seems to be acting sincerely and good, so the problem seems again to be the script which builds a kindergarten relationship.
A major problem is the chemistry that is supposed to develop between the two. It is told and happens to be, but I don't feel that really. On the other hand, I can feel the chemistry between the grim reaper and the boss, luckily the side characters are interesting, especially the reaper who also builds intelligibly other types of chemistry with goblin and other characters. They tide up the show what could otherwise be really boring. I just think that the reaper had to have a more restricted wardrobe and stick to a gloomy style wearing the same clothes. It is annoying when the characters don't wear anything twice except for the uniforms.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

It has a high rating, so I kept watching episode after episode, but their stories just didn't progress. Ok, we know her purpose and we know his purpose, what next and when will it arrive. The story just doesn't move. They are supposed to be a couple, but there's no chemistry, much more because of the poor writing about their relationship. Devoted to each other and that's all. Exactly, that's all! The story just doesn't move, doesn't say anything.

tt5994364,"I personally can't watch anymore any American series since I started to watch K-series and I know many people complain that k-series are too cheesy. I do want people to be more emotional and sentimental. Maybe that's how we will start to be considerate of others around us. Maybe that's how we will learn to have compassion towards each other. Also I don't find it bad when a woman acts like a child spoiled. I am happy when I am spoiled by my husband and those are the few moments you are true to yourself reverting into a childish selfless self. Isn't life demanding enough day by day to come home and act all serious and mature? I find the child is this series well done. She isn't weak nor stupid, she just has a very hard life and wants to be loved and cherished like any other of us. She acted spoiled with Goblin cause she felt safe and good and she was herself. I don't find the storyline boring at all. I think slow build up is a must when you seek depth to a story. One thing about this series is that you can't predict what the characters will do next moment. It's really captivating and a few moments makes takes your breath away for real. A story of true love that lasts for centuries and how characters fight their destinies to be together with their loved ones. I find it simply amazing 👌",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

I love how each and every characters stories get together with each other forming a beautiful complete circle! The cinematography and directing is great! I love how chronologically they have arranged all the event's of the story , all the events fall in the exact place and time where they should be in both the past and the present storyline...! The dialogues were awesome , it had a great effect causing on the mood and emotional impact! I specially love how they sometimes tried to make the dialogues poetic for some of the characters lines wherever there was a heartfelt romantic or emotional scene!The humor in this drama is super hilarious and sometimes savage. Love how they try to give us some good giggles during an emotional scene.Breathtaking is the word. Must watch highly Recommended.

tt5994364,"I am not a big fan of fantasy dramas and i was skeptical about this drama before watching it. But it turned out to be an amazing mix of modern day and a little bit of ancient korea based drama. I really enjoyed this drama.
However, the HUGE age gap between the goblin(gong yu) and kim go eun who plays a student was really weird and made me uncomfortable. Imagine a man around his late 30s having feelings for a highschool student - weird right? They tried to tone it down in the drama by showing that much of the real ""romance"" or emotional attatchment happened after kim go eun turns into a legal adult but that doesn't change the fact that the age difference potrayed in the drama was unsettling. Furthermore, the whole scenario between the leads after the sword is taken out of the goblin becomes dragged. Like the whole him roaming around in a desert for years until she is reborn and then returning thing kept dragging and maybe could have been carried out differently bcs it felt like it was dragging a little.",,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"I like serious drama and loved two other Kdramas, Life (Laipeau) and Strangers. Courtesy of Netflix, I've dipped into several other Kdramas and found them unwatchable because of the high degree of silliness, by which I mean overacting, drippy over-emotional men, women who behave like school girls, painful rom-com plotlines that drag on forever. Perhaps this is a cultural problem on my part. This series was halfway between serious and silly. It had two superb engaging storylines, those of the goblin and the grim reaper, with lovely melding of the past and the present for this two characterters. But the love story between the goblin and his bride I found interminably boring and repetitive, boy toys with girl ad nauseum, and the grim reapers story was dragged out too. I know from Life that Lee Dong Wook is an outstanding actor, but I wouldn't have guessed it from this series where all he did was cry for the most part. Again maybe its my cultural problem but I like my men to be men and women not to be stupid. The end though was gripping and emotional. I regret wasting so much of my life watching this though. They could have done the job in 8 episodes if they had cut out the silliness.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"This show is so slow, overrated and just plain bad! Whatever points I feel it deserves are for great shots by the camera team, the choice of shooting locations and some dialogue writing. The story looses grip every now and then, any loose ends just left, the lead actress is just bad, the character is written so annoying and her acting chops don't help in anyway to make it bearable.Bad!

I didn't think when I began to watch that it would make me laugh out loud and cry, I mean sobbing cry but it did. All of the actors portrayed their characters perfectly. I especially loved Lee Dong Wook. His humor and sadness touched me so much. The writing was exemplary and I found some of the dialogue so thoughtful I had to write down parts the touched me so deeply.

tt5994364,Honestly I thought it was too hyped. I wasn't even hooked from the first episode. I kept on criticising it on my mind. But by the time I was midway I had to admit that writer did an outstanding job. The development of bonding between goblin and grim reaper is one of a kind. The ending was okay too. It's amazing how the writer wrote the second lead so beautifully. I loved the second lead's heart retching story more than the main lead.. I m glad I kept this drama as my 50th kdrama celebration!

tt5994364,"This drama is a collection of actors, particularly male actors. The plot is engaging to watch. Unlike Vagabone, where things get exciting from EP 1 to the end, Goblin starts off slowly for me. It's very sleepy. The point about the sword in the chest is tediously repeated. However, after EP 10, the hidden content is revealed, and it becomes exciting. It can get a 9 or 10 if it is more concise. Overall, it's an enjoyable drama.Another thing I enjoy is music, for example, I will go to you like the first snow and Hush.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5994364,"Goblin seemed like a new and fresh opus of a kdrama. Gorgeous, jaw dropping cinematography. A very different and enticing concept. Mysterious and endearing characters. I just wished it held that ambition through out the series.The driving force of the drama is just the concept or ""idea"" of it rather than the writing, character development and plot,which is really lacking. Instead of an intersting story development as its interesting concept, it heavily relies on sparkling and glamorized dialogues between the characters, which should not be the pulsion of a good drama.This is evident after the 4th episode where the entire show severely drags on one particular thing: Removal of the sword. Thats it. It has nothing else to offer or draw in.Not to mention some particular scenes being shown through flashbacks so frequently to the point where it was simply unnecessary.However, the character interactions where enjoyable, especially between goblin and grim reaper, funny and heart warming.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5994364,"The storyline isn't as strong as expected. The overarching theme is that Eun Tak is Kim Shin's bride and all she has to do is to pull out his sword from his heart so he can finally leave the world in peace. The show was dragged out for a bit, I especially thought so when Eun Tak had to be repeatedly saved by the Goblin a few times. I cringed a little watching these scenes knowing that they're appealing to women because it's a good feeling to be protected/saved by someone powerful...The Grim Reaper and Sunny's love story paralleled that of the Goblin's. This seems to be a common pattern that occurs in Korean romantic drama and does not seem to offer much freshness.Overall, this series was still quite entertaining to watch, thanks to the acting skills of the cast! I'm a fan of Gong Yoo's and I must say, I prefer watching him in movies - he brings passion/intensity and professionalism to the big screen.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

I couldn't stop laughing and found myself smiling the whole time when they were on screen.And of course it is the same with the relationship between the main leads. It has everything and it's such a wholesome couple. They fight and argue like literal teenagers but then they grow to love each other deeply and is just such deep, passionate and heartbreaking love story...pure joy to watch.Kim Go Eun Gong is such a versatile actress, she absolutely nails the role as teenager and you believe she is way younger than she is, I have seen her in many dramas and I just respect her so much her talent. And of course the master Gong Yoo, spectacular actor, completely unhinged when he was furious and angry and sweet as one can be when he was looking the eyes of his loved one. There's no emotion he didn't master and I loved read his eyes in every scene, very powerful.I have to confess the age difference ( more in the drama than real life) made me cringe a lot the first tile I saw the series, but when you force yourself to focus on the context and historical/fantastic point of view , you will accept it.I wish they will ever make a drama as great as this one is.You don't want to miss this.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

""Goblin"" (aka: Guardian: The Lonely and Great God) is that show. Every single actor and character draws you in further and further with each episode. I can't help myself but to rewatch this series, often.Unfortunately, the channel ""DramaFever"" which had this series available to anyone who subscribed has since shut down and I cannot find this series available in Region 1 anywhere else.

tt5994364,"Goblin comes with the usual features of Korean romances set in a modern setting. Expect a consistent display of product placements (not always elegantly woven into the story) and the per usual fascination with materialism (high end goods, hot young CEOs and beef for some reason) that rings a bit false with the moral message that love is true and money doesn't matter. But that aside, it is a heart warming story in which the loves of two couples are cleverly interwoven with a bromance and elements of fantasy that stays on the right side of cheesy. It takes pain seriously (you will find it hard not to go teary at times; the acting is good and the heartaches come across as sincere), but juxtaposes it well with a flippant and light-hearted humour. A few exchanges become lost in translation, presumably due to being specific to the Korean culture and not translating well outside of it. There are also a few episodes halfway through that drags. But it is worth staying with it to the end. A very sweet and entertaining tale. Put it on the list.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"There are a LOT of 10/10 reviews for this series. And sprinkled among those great reviews are a relatively few very low-scoring reviews. I come down somewhere in the middle.The good stuff:The production and cinematography of this series were both truly great. It was beautiful.The acting was also top notch. I've come to expect that with Kdramas and they almost alway deliver. I think Kim Go-Eun did a terrific job. Some reviewers have complained she acted TOO young (e.g. Like a 9 YO not a 19 YO). But that is not the fault of the actress. She did a fantastic job given the material (and likely direction) that she was given. If part of this was her interpretation of her role, I am fine with that too. She is very beautiful and and has a big, radiant smile.Gong Yoo was excellent as well, although I did not really connect with his character. (Being a Goblin is tuff, I get it, but...)And, of course, after loving ""Touch Your Heart"" - and I think that phrase was used in this series :-) - I loved seeing You In-Na and Lee Dong-Wook together again. Well, for the first time I guess ha ha.So why a 7?Fantasy is not my thing, to be honest. But I don't feel that was a big negative for me. I thought it might be, but I'm open to another fantasy series.Both my wife and I were just not drawn to this series. Quite a few times we discussed bailing out, but decided we wanted to see how it ended, even though we felt we new what would happen, but just not how they would get there. We didn't have a strong feeling for the characters, and I am not sure why. Was it because the plot was so fatalistic that you KNEW everyone was going to be utterly miserable until the very end? (And I mean the VERY END.) So where is the tension in that? At least in part that was a problem. Was it because of the age different between the main leads? Yeah, it felt a bit cringe at times, although that is pretty old-fashioned of me, I admit. FL was 19 and in the US that is an adult. But it did mean there was a lack of passion in the relationship for 90% of the series. (Then there were Sunny and the Grim Reaper who had passion but just could not act on it.)There were scenes where we didn't really get what was going on. Either we missed some important stuff leading up to the scene, or got bogged down in reading the subtitles? We've watched 20+ series at this point, and this has never happened before.After all that, back to some positives to mitigate some of the negatives.There were some scenes that really did have an impact on us. They were smaller scenes that were both unexpected and very emotional:

Young Ji Eun-Tak with her ghost mother and the birthday cakeThe mother of the young woman who died looking through her daughter's apartmentSunny knocking off the Grim Reaper's hat and that whole sceneJi Eun-Tak in her room, distraught and crying and not knowing why***End Spoilers***Scenes such as these showed what the team was capable of in terms of both the script and the execution.One last positive thing to note is that I said the series was really well made, and I want to re-emphasize that.

tt5994364,I had high expectations from it and I honestly I am so bitterly disappointed. This is not the first time either this has happened. I dunno how some of these kdrama get such high ratings when they are truly terrible. I don't even know where to begin with this one. The biggest problem in this story is the age gap between the male and female lead. They're showing romance between a 19 year old school girl with a 40 year old man. The 19 actually acts like a 10 year old and the 40 yo man acts like .. well a 40 year old man. You can see what the problem is here..? Just eww. I really could not stomach the so called romantic scenes between them. Really seemed like an uncle and niece pair. It made me so deeply uncomfortable that I stopped watching after 2.5 episodes. And the female lead is oh SO ANNOYING. Her character is completely at odds with her backstory. Her mother died when she was 9 and she was raised by an aunt who is the Kdrama equivalent of Aunt Petunia and somehow this girl turns out to be silly and bubbly and completely immature and irresponsible. What the heck! Gong Yoo acts like a cardboard cutout. What exactly is the story here? The characters just keep stumbling about aimlessly. I really believe all these 10/10 ratings are given by teenagers who fantasize being with an older man not knowing how egregious it is in reality.,negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The director and writer are a killer team, having worked previously together on Descendants of the Sun (another excellent Korean drama), and together they have crafted a drama of such beguiling beauty I find myself dreaming of it still, several weeks later.

tt5994364,"I wanted to like because I absolutely loved Hotel Del Luna. I could see goblin being the inspiration for the latter, because there were many similar themes and use of visual effects. However sadly, Goblin failed to really hit it for me in the same way Hotel Del Luna did.The first four episodes got so slow in its pacing and story arc that I was starting to fall asleep. There was only one major plot line, so at times it did start to drag. There was a major twist that was thrilling coming in the later half of the series and I felt they could have added more elements of mystery.I love Gong Yoo, he has always been a favourite since watching Train to Busan. The performance in this series is pretty good. However the characters is where I wasn't fully sold on. The two main characters chemistry at times it felt a little forced and was a bit too upfront at the beginning. I wished there was bit more time given before really establishing the two together. Let's be honest a 900 year old man with a teenager is a bit off putting. Only towards the end did the two start to come together. Hotel Del Luna did this better making sure the two just wasn't into each at the beginning, slowly throughout the series did the two main characters at knit together.Also the side characters felt a bit awkward at times and some characters completely neglected in the overall story (like the nephew character seem to be forgotten in the latter half).Overall written story could have been much better, Ijust felt there was a layer missing.If you enjoy a slower paced drama with some laughs and a view of Quebec City, this would be good. Otherwise I recommend Hotel Del Luna for better story.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"This drama was very popular and if you read the fanboy and fan girl reviews, you'll get a completely misleading idea. This series is tolerable only if a love of eye candy, especially the uber-gorgeous Yoo In-Na, allows you to overlook its fundamental flaws - of which there are many.Let's start with the obvious. The story is just miserably dull. Derivative, silly, sloppy. Fantasies only work when they have internal consistency. That is, maybe there is some basic unreal premise that you have to accept for the whole thing to hang together but once accepted the story is consistent with the premise. Not here. There's no logic within the illogical world the writer has created and so the narrative is choppy at best and senseless at worst. And oh my goodness does the story drag - anything with a plot so thin and devoid of invention simply won't fill the hour long episodes. Even the obligatory cliffhangers at the end of each episode were more like hanging from the first floor window with your feet on the ground than dangling over the precipice.Second, the characters. Our leads are breathtaking to look at (by the way, our beautiful young heroine, allegedly 19 years old in the story but the actress, Kim Go-eun, was 25 when this was released) but utterly aimless. There's no reason for anything they say or do and the dialog consists of an endless string of declaratory statements that lead nowhere - and laden with one of the most over-used tropes of Korean shows in which every question is deftly, or should I say ploddingly, evaded by a reply in the form of another question. Why does our heroine not say that she saw the sword that would have persuaded the hero that she is supposed to be his bride? The explanation she eventually gives is trite and utterly lacking credibility. There's no sense to any of it. Our heroine is delightful but there is something more than a little off about the notion that she should hook up with a man in his thirties. That wasn't necessary for the story to work and it was distractingly, well, icky. And our hero is not delightful at all - charmless, arbitrary in his dealings with her for no discernible reason, and endowed with personal conflicts that just don't command much sympathy or interest. One scene after another in which he ignores her for no reason, teases her for no reason, won't do any thing for her for no reason, alternating between meaningless meanness and tiny, begrudged kindnesses that he soon takes back. And the actor who played him, Gong Yoo, was expressionless throughout. Plainly, when he asked the director, ""What's my motivation?"" the answer came back, ""None. Play it bland.""Third, production values. You can't easily make a fantasy without spending a bit (by which I mean a lot) of money on special effects. Either they didn't spend it or they mis-spent it. Compare this show to the fantastic (if ungrammatically named) Hotel Del Luna. A story with a somewhat similar set of ideas, not without blemishes, but visually extraordinary. It's not utterly impossible to make a fantasy on the cheap - consider the great Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law film Gattaca - but this wasn't it.All in all, a poor, somewhat limp mess. I try not to review shows that I haven't seen through to the end, so I waded through this one, hoping all the while for some improvement that would justify all the raves (and, in fairness, gazing on the beauteous female leads did take off some of the sting) but at the end of the day, I should have spent my time doing something else. So should you.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The cast is perfect, I love Go-eun Kim so much, the way she expresses for her character is natural and lovely, she's the very first reason why I chose to watch this drama.

I took my time going through the episodes 'cause it's just so epic and incredible.By the time it was over, I kind of wished there had been a follow-up or spin-off of this series.

tt5994364,"Gonna get a lot of hate for this but this was just NOT for me even though I had set no expectations from it. The events and storylines changes rapidly with very little expectations. People seem to promise not meet again but they are dating again and back to not meeting again in the same episode.
A series that could be wrapped up in 5 episodes is dragged to 16. IT HAD ITS MOMENTS HERE AND THERE but in between those moments, the characters and stories between them was just going back and forth between same tried and tested events. LOT of inconsistencies with many continuity errors.
I think I need to watch few more k-dramas to develop a taste for them. Until then, its 4/10 from me.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"Goblin is a well-shot, stylish and artistic drama with some great locations. In addition to the cinematography, the soundtrack is also good and the plot is interesting. Despite a few extremely silly scenes, I enjoyed the bromance between the Goblin and the Grim reaper. That said, the female lead and the plot holes somewhat let it down. Although I did not hate Kim Go-eun, her character was not well-written and her inconsistent acting made it worse. Yoo In-na, the supporting actress, in contrast was impressive in her role and uplifted the drama. I also enjoyed the Grim reaper's romance more than the Goblin's. The ending was a bit incomplete and did not completely do justice to all the sub-plots. All in all, although a few elements prevented this from being an exceptional drama, it was nevertheless an enjoyable watch. 7.5/10",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The show is a complete package, the scenario, the sound effects and music, visual effects, the cinematography and most importantly the casting and the actings are amazing. You cry with the characters, laugh with them and fall in love with them. The chemistry between them are really cool and amazing.

It felt... well boring per se. And I feel that the pacing wasn't that good either. The reason for why I gave it a 6 is because it wasn't necessarily bad but actually a bit enjoyable, it's just that it's too long and I didn't really feel the need to continue watching it further .",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"What a ride this series was! The series embodies the best of Korean dramas. Take what is basically a fairy tale, plop in into modern time and proceed to capture us with all of the magic. The cinematography, the music and acting were all top notch. It is not easy to make a fairy tale relatable but it was. You could feel the heartache, the loneliness, the friendship, the anger, the fear and the love. Beautiful production.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5994364,"I never heard of this show until I found myself looking for a new series to watch. It had a high rating and the reviews had me wanting to see it for myself. Well I got hooked instantly the setting and premise had me wanting more. Having watched Lee Dong-Wook in Tale of the Nine Tailed Fox I was excited. His bromance with the lead made it a fun ride along. But the star of the show for me was Kim Go-Eun. She absolutely nailed her role and performance,she was sweet funny and super cute. Even through every hardship her character had endured she manages to just keep you smiling.This is a fantasy drama that is done and executed beautifully well ep1-14. But this is a 16ep show and after 14 I gave up as the story just lost it's magic. Without wanting to spoil it for others personally It felt like I was now watching a different series all together. Korean shows are done to high standard but 9 out 10 shows are poorly finished. The last episode always leaves you baffled it's like they run out of ideas and then just put together leftover cut scenes to try add another 60min. Which is a shame really as 10 star shows then drop to 7 and 8s. If this ended at ep14 or had different take from 15 then I would rate it as one of the best but not for me. I just didn't get get it after 14 but to each their own it's entertaining enough for my recommendation.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5994364,"I loved this show-the amazing cast, the perfect bromance between the grim reaper and goblin, the epic soundtracks, and so on. However, the bittersweet ending was a bit too much for my taste. The inevitable death of Eun-tak was too dark for a finale, and I always argue that there wasn't enough time to truly appreciate the last few minutes of happy scenes right before the ending.For example, the fact that Sunny and the grim reaper forgot their past lives requires at least half an episode for the viewers to bond with the new personalities that, at some subconscious level, loved each other for eternity. Moreover, considering that this is the second life of Eun-tak, there is no guarantee that it is conflict-free. Given how the gods in this world system hate long-lasting relationships, I could see death coming after her again (maybe they are just torturing the goblin). Either way, I hoped there were some hints that this time it's going to be different for the main characters, and we had more time to witness their long-awaited happiness.Especially not providing any explicit solution for Goblin's immortality makes the whole story eventually tragic. So once again, may her second, third, and fourth lives be much happier and conflict-free! ^^",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

This drama has a nice backstory and although it's quite typical and it has been repeated a lot in other dramas and movies, keeps you interested.
I loved the funny moments and the most appealing thing for me was the story and relationship of the two brothers as well as the backstories of all the supporting cast, moving, deep and painful but very beautiful.

I thought at first its a progressing story but no. Its 16 eps already completed. Nobody can't stop me, neither myself from watching undisturbed why?

From the oldest actor to the you youngest. All of them did an amazing job. Became a lee dong wook fan after this show. His role and character was something to drool over tbh. Anyhow.Cinematography: 8/10
Would have preferred more graphics and animation for a fantasy show. Like transition from human to nine tailed fox graphics etc.Musical scores: 10/10
Best i have seen in any kdrama so far! Just amazing. Mesmerizing. Beautiful. Sad everything. The scores were unbelievably good. Like more than the actor i am fangirling over this shows OSTs. Lol.Acting: 8/10
Felt some character gaps in lee dong wook character when he is supposed to be acting all goofy and cute. Like it didnt feel real. Like it felt like he was acting. Usually in other scenes he was so engrossed in the character it felt like he is his character. This lacked kindof. Boah's acting was good too. Like it was average. Lee rang ( kim beum) emotional range was limited because of the character but somehow his acting seemed like it had more depth than main actor. Dont know why. (Not because i had the second lead syndrome. This drama gave me a very strong first lead syndrome lol. Nothing could overcome LDW role in the show:D )
Side characters acting was also good.Main lead chemistry : 8/10 (could have been more from female actress side.Storyline/ Plot: 7/10
there were obvious plot holes like big ones. So thats why the rating is an 8. Else it would be 9. The last episode twist and turns seemed an overkill thats why it never became a 10 star for me.Script: 8/10
good dialogues , witty and on spot. Suited the characters arc.Character development:10/10

Only 6 episodes so far, but it's getting better and better, and a lot of secrets are yet to be revealed. Lee Dong-wook has really nailed the role, he's just the perfect actor for Yeon's character. All the actors have played their roles very well to he honest. I never for a second got bored or thought that it's going slowly, I'm enjoying all of it. It's already one of my top 5 favorite kdramas.

I'm not always a huge fan of fantasy... it has to be very well done for me to be even moderately interested. So many fantasy shows are just cheesy and poorly executed. But this... this is incredible!
It is so well - written and tightly plotted...the story just slays, it is so fresh!
The direction is perfectly handled, giving room for the story and the actors to breathe... production values are amazing, and the acting is exceptional for a fantasy series...
The actors' chemistry is on fire, not only between Lee Dong-Wook and Jo Bo-Ah, who play the lead characters, but also between each of them and Kim Bum, who plays the half-gumiho, half-human brother... I have read that there is also some improv happening, which just completely blows my mind! If the director is allowing/encouraging that, then you know you have some superbly talented actors in the production... Supporting actors Hwang Hee, Kim Yong-Ji, and Lee Tae-Ri are also putting in stellar work here. Character development is everything, and it is not lacking anywhere... If you happen to be a music lover, you may find yourself exploring the work of the artists on the soundtrack... Blue Moon, by Kim Jong-Wan (NELL), is the perfect theme: moody, intense, and soulful...
Granted, there are 2 episodes left, so I suppose things could spin massively out of control, but having not once been disappointed by anything this far in, I think we're good...

Not once did I feel the urge to go back to this one. I only finished so I could add it to my list.What in the world happened? I think too many twists and turns, and side stories, and no real development of the romance. The chemistry was bad if you ask me. Same girl in Bulgasal, OMG! I didn't like Bulgasal either, but whenever the leads were near each other, I couldn't stand still. Their chemistry was phenomenal. In this drama, it felt like the real love story was between Yeon and his brother. That was actually what kept me interested. A bit.The last scene is mentionned nowhere in the comments. How come? It ruins everything.

tt12879418,"6/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean romantic supernatural drama with 16, 60-75 minute episodes. First I provide a unique synopsis then review.SynopsisAt one time Lee Yeon (Lee Dong-wook) was a guardian mountain spirit but he fell in love with a human who was killed. In his grief he struck a bargain to live among humans in the city and hunt other supernaturals who broke the rules. In exchange for his service, his love was to be reincarnated although he did not know when or who she may be reincarnated as. In all of his Over 1000 years as a Gumiho, and during his long wait for his love to be reincarnated, Lee Yeon has seen many humans who resembled his lost love but has discovered they only look like her they are not her reincarnation. So when reporter Nam Ji-ah (Jo Bo-ah) recognizes Lee Yeon from an encounter as a child, Lee Yeon does not assume there is any special connection. But the two are connected not only through a tragedy in her past that may have taken the lives of her parents but even more so by the fact that Nam Ji-ah is the reincarnation of Ah-eum, the woman Lee yeon was waiting for. As Lee Yeon finds himself attracted to Ji ah he is confused as Ah eum had his fox beecd and her reincarnation should have had the bead as well. But Ji ah does not have the bead although so much about her is like Aheum. Others notice Ji ah's similarity to Ah eum including Lee Rang (Kim Bum) who was jealous of his brother's attention and the fact that he gave up his guardian role for love. And others from the past alsotake notice of Ji ah. The two fall in love allover again as Lee Yeon fulfills his current obligation as well as solving the mysterious events of the past.ReviewI waited to watch this because of mixed reviews. Recently there were some really positive reviews so I thought I would give it a try. I think whether or not someone likes it would be influenced by how much of a purist they are. If you take ""Little Mermaid"" as an example. The original story is not very uplifting. Most renditions of it take some broad artistic license in telling the story and deviate a lot from that original story. With ""Tale of the Nine Tailed Fox"" they stick close to that lore, particularly at the end of the series. I am not in love with the actual lore any more than I am a fan of the real ""Little Mermaid"" story. I like the concept but don't want to watch something that follows it as it does not have the best outcomes. The romance is okay. Their chemistry is fine but there wasn't the slow build up. I would not watch this again and would only recommend it to those that are super fans of any of the main actors or that like stories that stick to a more pure form. It has some sad moments but I wouldn't characterize it as overall sad. I think it is very mediocre amd would have stopped watching it if I was not already half way through.SpoilersThe love story was really 600 years before when he originally fell in love with her. We saw so little of that original story it was hard to buy him waiting 600 years for her. Because his test was the ""fox bead"" being present or not it made me curious if all those others that looked like her might have been her reincarnated in earlier times. It never addressed why those earlier people that looked like her were not her reincarnated when the test he was using was flawed.I liked his brother but it made no sense to me that he was doing evil things to his brother just because he felt abandoned by him. If you love someone so much you are hurt by them not paying attention to you why would you do things that could result in their demise. I was glad he came around and the brothermance was one of the few good qualities of the show. But I did not enjoy the first part of the show where he was simply being jealous and immature.You have this cool nine tailed fox that did some interesting things catching some of the bad supernaturals in the beginning but that was such a small part of the whole series. Mostly it is him just pining after her. Long scenes with the romantic music of them just gazing. I got bored. My daughter, who I was watching it with, was more bored than I was. My boredom started after about episode eight and was not alleviated until about ½ way through the last episode. There just wasn't that much happening. I found the serpent to be a boring super villain. The nine tailed fox wasn't doing anything cool and it was just them fawning all over each other and stressing about her turning into a serpent. She could have been reporting on all kinds of cool supernatural stuff and he could have been helping her. But no. Just more and more of just them living their life. It was boring.What was up with grandma turning to stone? She turns herself to stone then he sacrifices himself and she just turns back? How? Why didn't they talk about that more. I mean I was glad she was back. I liked her even though she could be really cold. But explain how that happened at least.So, in the end we go through several scenes thinking he is now human. Oh woe is me I have to get a root canal. Being a human is hard. But, surprise, at the very end we see he is still a fox. What? How? I thought he died and was reincarnated. And part of all that was he was now human. But I read somewhere that the cast said if you understand the real story of the gumiho you get it. So I read it and apparently one way a fox can become human is to trick their love interest for three years into thinking there are human. So that is what he was doing. He was tricking her. But not very well because he slipped up about them having a daughter. But why would she trip on that anyway. He could have just been saying that. I get they were sticking to the lore and all that but they did not explain that lore to the viewer. So, unless you knew to go read about that, it was just confusing. Why was he faking it? And that doesn't even make sense to me anyway. No more than bubbles with the Little Mermaid. I didn't like it. It was silly.Why did the brother die? I was just liking him. And what cold people. So sad when Lee died but then the brother dies, they shed just a very few tears and then are like Lee is back. No big deal brother was sacrificed. They made a big deal about him having a family but he didn't. They didn't seem to care beyond just those few moments. Life went on perfectly without him. In fact it smoothed over all their newlywed troubles. The little boy didn't even seem to care his surrogate dad/brother was gone. But don't worry he is reincarnated as about a six or seven year old child. Okay he looks like him but I thought you were convinced that all those other people that looked like main girl were not her. So how do you know that little boy is him? It was just stupid. And how do they explain some are reincarnated as a newborn but some seem to appear at various ages. Too weird. Not buying it. Not even in a mythological sense.I guess I am of the unpopular opinion that this just wasn't very good. Lots of potential with such cool characters (foxes and other immortals) but they just told a very boring love story. I never like love stories where they get together too soon and that is what this felt like. Okay. They are together. Let's go home. Oh she is going to turn into the serpent? I don't care. You had your love story. And the side love stories? Also pretty uninspired.#TaleoftheNineTailed. #LeeDongWook #JoBoAh. #KimBum.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"Way too sentimental-sometimes the writers didn't seem to know how to add variety to the plot. Having not one but TWO reunions with the parents was a bit much-even if one reunion was a fantasy. Jia seemed childlike and one-dimensional-and it wasn't believable that she was the object of Yeon's fascination for 600 years. I did appreciate the fact that Yeon wasn't your standard pretty-boy Korean hero, and that he had a unique look.Special effects were lacking. If you're going to do a series about a nine-tailed fox, the audience should catch a glimpse of him looking like an actual fox now and then. Same goes for the serpent. Endless, endless threats to the lives of Yeon or Jia throughout the series made the ending a tedious anticlimax. Too much concentration on food in scene after scene. Whenever one of the bad guys was supposed to be in ""evil"" mode he/she smirked constantly--an overused device. The background music was saccharine without being moving and effective. Seemed like a fairly low-budget production.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

There have been a number of excellent shows this year, but this one, for me, really was a standout! Massive appreciation to everyone involved in this series, in a year when so much of real life was a trash pile...",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

tt12879418,"I liked the first season but there were some gaps and the ending wasn't enjoyable for me, overall it was good, when I found out that the second season is coming and the trailer was pretty good I was so happy, the second season started great and ended amazing, I thought I will be kind of sad when it ends but unexpectedly I was truly satisfied and happy, the writing is amazing like the last episode was so enjoyable and great, if you like the genres give it a shot, I don't usually recommend but I kinda want to recommend this everywhere lol, maybe I'm just in my happy bubbly feelings after the last episode xD.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"There was so much promise with this - I love fantasy and the cast seemed great but why was I so bored. I think the main characters lacked chemistry and the story was to elaborate and drawn out. I found the supporting actors the most interesting, especially Range but they didn't make the most of these characters either. The female lead did a great jobs of playing the serpent - she's a great actress. The male lead just flicked his hair a lot and was unlikeable and lacked any sort of chemistry with his female lead. I liked him in goblin but he was awful in this.I got most of the way through but couldn't be bothered to watch the last two episodes.This is one of the very few kframas I just couldn't finish.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"I was wondering what part of this tall skinny main guy was appealing, and it took 15 episodes to realise it's his eyebrows. They have their own beat and express so much and pretty much tell the whole tale! The story was good with lots of twists, turns, good, bad, evil, food, animals etc, but I could have done without the initial puppy scene which was a bit upsetting to me.It's an interesting fairytale meets real world scenario, a bit unrealistic if you want to apply it to our current world, but hey, this is tv and let your imagination just run with it and enjoy the show and forget about life for a while.They've set the scene for a follow-up, whether it happens or not remains to be seen, but somehow I think I'd watch it, these foxes are cunning!",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"First of all, warning, this critter is only in Korean voice. Ther are English subtitles, but you will have to choose the subtitles or the picture as everything is moving so fast. I chose the pause button. The only problem with this is I was watching on Amazon TV and the Amazon extra information covers up the subtitles. So, you will have to get used to the pause and back buttons. Watching on the computer does not have the Amazon problem. Spanish, French, or German you can tell if the subtitles are correct. However, with Korean you will just have to trust them. Every once in a while, English creeps in; so, I wonder if English crept into the language? It looks as some of the episode ending credits have English titles.The nine-tailed fox (Chinese: pinyin) is a mythical fox entity originating from Chinese mythology.The show starts out with a quote similar to:
""When a fox is fifty years old, it can transform itself into a woman; when a hundred years old, it becomes a beautiful female, or a spirit medium, or an adult male who has sexual intercourse with women. Such beings are able to know things at more than a thousand miles' distance; they can poison men by sorcery, or possess and bewilder them, so that they lose their memory and knowledge; and when a fox is a thousand years old, it ascends to heaven and becomes a celestial fox."" - from the book ""The Cult of the Fox: Power, Gender, and Popular Religion in Late Imperial and Modern China"" by Xiaofei KangBack to the series, this appears to be a soap opera with a tad of magic tossed in. Ther seem to be a few leaping lizard scenes like that of the Matrix. And it did not take them long to use the flashlight gimmick where no one knows how to use a light switch. Many of the scenes are darker than they need to be (not evil dark, not enough lighting.)We are starting to get a few flashbacks as fillers and reminders. Ther are some nice twists and turns as we are figuring out what is happening and why.Eventually many loose ends will be tied.Be prepared as there are only going to be 16 episodes in season one. Then you will be scraping the bottom of your mint chocolate chip ice cream container.It is nicely wrapped up. No wait what is this a season 2 who knew?Yep 12 episodes of the same thing. If you like the same thing, you are in for a treat as it does not let down. If you are expecting a revelation forget it the first season is enough.",neutral,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

tt12879418,"I expected more from this drama. I am a little dissapointed. I will start with the goof stuff :
a) Winsome cast, b) nice acting from Lee Dong-Wook and Jo Bo-ah(quite a match) ,c) bromance between the two brothers and the vet(which gave the show a comedy touch) , d) it becomes better at the end. However the scenario didn't win me. It has lots of gaps, such as how Nam Jih ah grew up by herself (she was only 9 years old and her uncle let her alone at her family's house ? ) and when Yeon and Nam Ji-ah got so close with each other at first place . At the begging of the series, some episodes are rather weird, for example the episode with the fishermen (what the hell was that?). Moreover while I was watching the first episodes, I couldn't catch up with the story and I was really confused. Nevertheless the 8th episode cleared the air for me by bringing up the whole story . After that, it became boring in some episodes and Nam Jih ah and her fate overshadowed the rest story.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,So - a mountain God searches for hundreds of years for his lost love - of course he eventually finds her but she has problems of her own which she isn't aware of.I have seldom seen a Kdrama with such passionless kisses - a mere pressing of lip on lip - closed mouth - no jaw movement.The ML might be good looking but he cannot kiss for toffee.The FL was equally unresponsive which makes one wonder why.For a mountain God the character was spectacularly weak and couldn't seem to protect himself against anything.His brother Rang had more of a presence in this series - he seemed much more engaged in his part and his acting was strong and confident whereas the ML seemed too cool and concerned with his appearance. He drifted through this like a male model with the exception of a couple of unnecessary fight scenes which served no purpose.The story was slow and tried to include some comedic characters which fell rather flat.Don't believe the fan reviews - this series was boring and disappointing and far too long.,negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

In Love with Lee Yeon 😍",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"This story for me was so intriguing and captivating. I could never guess the outcome, which I give a lot of points for. Lee Don-Wook and Jo Bo-Ah both play their characters seamlessly. You watch each character grow and change. Literally, everyone entangles into each other in a near flawless storyline. I won't give anything away, but I cried three times and it's definitely worth the watch!!",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"One of the best K dramas I've watched, the casting was impeccable and Lee Dong Wook and Kim Bum especially are just phenomenal. The story was gripping, I cried a lot watching this, laughed just as much and was blown away with some of the twists and turns. If you haven't watched this yet you're really missing out. The camera work, the visuals, the locations were breathtaking in some parts, I watched all 16 episodes in 2 days, definitely binge worthy, have your tissues ready, Lee Dong Wook is just perfect for the role of our 9 tailed Fox, he made every scene effortlessly cool! And the ending, I screamed!",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

I was hooked from the first episode itself. The pain of waiting for the next episode every week was unbearable!!!The soundtrack was so touching that my eyes were pooled with tears every time I heard them. Especially 'the parting at the river of three crossing'.I recommend this to everyone who likes to watch fantasy movies and dramas. But before the fantasy element comes their romance, which is so heart warming to watch.The twisted yet heart wrenching brotherhood also melts your heart especially towards the end.An amazing work beautifully executed by the cast and crew.
The idea of bringing mythical creatures to modern day life is not a new concept but still it was so thrilling to watch.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

At first lee dong wook's Character, lee yeon, was really annoying but it got better as the show went on
I couldn't tolerate Female lead because it looked like she has nothing to offer except a sad backstory and being a love interest
Looking forward to season 2 as it is promised to focus on lee rang and lee yeon
Hopefully the writers did a better job this time.",neutral,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"The story is great and it follows many Korean legends. The ending infact at the beginning could be difficult to understand, but can be appreciated once you've read the legend of the nine tails.The character playing the nine tale is very good looking even tho he is 40 years old 😂.Besides that that, it is a good tv series that exploits very well also the story of secondary characters and looks into their emotional journey.In conclusion i need to add that while it is a good fantasy, the characters reactions are too drammatic and they cry too many times. The female protagonist is the biggest cry baby of all time, 30% of scenes are showing her crying.But if you are into fantasy and legends this could be a good pic for you.",neutral,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

Unlike any k-drama I've ever watched!!
The plot is unique!
It's so good!!",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"Monsters and myths are not my usual viewing preferences, but I have sufficient faith in k dramas to give such stories a chance and so ended up watching this.The love story at the centre of this series was sufficiently engaging to transcend my viewing preferences and draw me in. Both the actors playing those lovers give committed performances. Lee Dong-wook has impressed me previously, but Jo Bo-ah, who I have not seen before, was the heart and soul of this drama. I look forward to seeing her again.So I watched this from start to end and did enjoy it. But it never quite hit the heights I hope for from a k drama. Perhaps that is because I could not invest in the non-human characters as much as I might have done.",neutral,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"This Drama is overextended. I fast-forwarded in almost every scene, including with Jia and Yeon kissing or hugging. Usually, in the Kdrama genre, most of people wait so long for the couple to kiss and show some affection. In this drama, I didn't care for the main character's love story even though he waited for her 600 years to be reborn. This drama can be done in a movie no need to drag 16 episodes to introduce the characters and explain the plot. Honestly, it could have been ended in the 10th episode.

tt12879418,"I'm a simple man. I see Lee Dong Wook, i binged watched the entire series. The only reason I'm giving it a 9 is due to the fact that there are quite a lot of awkward moments in the series. The story is great, character development i love it, and most importantly, its a show where it puts me in an emotional roller coaster.Finally, to anyone who is going to watch this, make sure to read or at least know some of the folklore. The story is really really enjoyable and interesting with knowing why and how the event in the story happens.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

I've watched several Korean dramas with different genres but mostly love stories, and in this drama, you would fall in love with each character the WAY the characters loved them. I never enjoyed series or movies with a hint of horror in them, but in this drama, even if it had those elements, I couldn't stop myself in watching them. I even replayed some parts multiple times!! If you believe in true love, trust, family and fate, this is the perfect drama to watch. It would break your heart in the finest way possible.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

And the final seconds of the climactic episode that surprised me so much and wondered that it meant there was a possibility there was a sequel.And I'm quite excited for Lee Yeon and Lee Rang. I'm really looking forward to the sequel. Because I feel Lee Beom's story still hangs and props me up. I think I'm starting to like Lee Rang's sad story too. Damn it!

They even showed the thriller moments in a very marvelous way. Additionally, it also had a lot of emotion in it also with amazing character developments. It's true as all the K-dramas this also stretched the show but it is very bearable as it was amazing. If you want something deep romance with a thriller it is the perfect show. One thing I would like to mention is the director has a really good selection for the cast of the main two characters as the looked really good with each other with both of them being really hot in the show.

I must say that everyone out there you need to watch this, it has what it takes to touch the audience's heart.

The characters were likeable and interesting across the board, acting was fantastic, storyline was so well paced also. I felt every episode was valuable and enjoyable, with no filler. It felt like a mature romance between main leads which I different from my usual Kdramas and I liked it. No messing around just genuine fondness and love for each other. There were only a few random scenes that I felt weren't necessary and some decisions the female lead made that made no sense when it came to safety but otherwise can't complain. I shed a tear or two towards the end also lol. Great elements of comedy throughout and would strongly recommend.",neutral,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"Now, my main problem was the motive of the whole drama. Just because a mountain god wanted her beloved to stay alive, they showed thousands of innocent people losing their lives and it didn't have any effect on the conscience of the main characters. They were playing a life for a life till the end but for each other. A good looking, rich, magical character can't do anything wrong, can he? Yeah, so if you actually want something with a good story it is not that. It was interesting to watch but I was expecting a good ending, which they failed to provide.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

It turns out, this show is largely based on it, imagine that -_- quick google search would help you understand the meaning of last scene. Keep in mind that this show was created with Korean audience, not for Westerners so why would they need to explain how fox's transformation to human works to those who already know it.Personally loved this show, got very emotionally invested. Characters are well thought out and performance is amazing, no complaints about cast (except maybe for Jo Bo-ah who very much overplayed). Lee Dong-wook killed his part and can't imagine anyone else playing it.Loved this show a lot, the feels it made me feel :(((

That Lee Dong Wook/Lee Yeon (Mountain Spirit of Baekdudaegan) is totally a spunk so I want to watch him. I wonder if he's on my list of actors that I like. He's got that vibe.It is a fascinating story of a thousand year love affairs between this nine tailed fox and human, but then is she really a human. He has waited for her to reincarnated. While in the meantime he has been the reaper for wayward creatures.So far I really like it but I have lots of questions about this relationship.It is so symbolic and mysterious and because I don't understand the Korea myths and legends it difficult for me to decipher. The green drink lady (Eoduk Sini) thought she knew all their fears but she didn't know her own. Her and Imugi had been working together. She was lured to mock Lee Yeon is Mountain Spirit of Baekdudaegan and also a myth animal reaper so she had no chance in his world. So he killed her in his dream. Seems like he's planning to kill Imugi (a demon that has been awakened).Imugi is the demon that take over the woman (Jo Bo AhNam/ Ji Ah Ah Eum). He is trying to get rid of the demon. Near the end we find out there is two of them. It's a hard job dispatching of them.All the characters are out and about trying to one up the other side or just merely trying to survive. And while the foxes, snakes, and humans are battling it out trying to put an end to this centuries long feud, the all-powerful Granny Taluipa (Kim Jung Nan) decides it's time for her to act, which will mean insurmountable losses for both sides.

Moreover , everything in this drama happened just for saving the lead man.The only positive for me was the last episode (it was the only not-boring episode) and the characters of Lee Rang ,Yoo-ri and Soo-oh. There are also a nice moral message concerning the love between family members and the mutual aid.UPDATE after S2 : Season 2 totally worth to watch it!

tt12879418,"Story dragged on a bit after the promise of first 2 episodes. Not enough sub-plots to justify 16 episodes. Too many unnecessary scenes which ruined a perfectly good concept. They could've wrapped it up in 10 episodes, maybe less.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

tt12879418,"I really enjoyed this series when I first watched it in 2020, loving it even more watching it again in preparation for the second season starting May 6th!Scifi/Fantasy, Action and RomCom are my favorite genres and this has it all! For me, Lee DongWook shone brighter than the sun in this series. I remember seeing him in Goblin and thought he was really handsome and funny, but it wasn't until I saw him in this that I became a very loyal fan. His comedic timing is on point, the sexual tension he brings to the screen is palpating, and he's able to bring a strength and athleticism to the action scenes making the unbelievable believable.The rest of the cast is great too, but I'm even more excited about the casting for the upcoming second season!Highly recommend this show, I watched it on Viki.

Can't say it's a favorite, I like him as Grim Reaper a lot more, that love story was just devastating. But for this show, all off the side characters were great, the love story was solid, the fantasy stuff was good, it just kinda dragged on a bit. It started off super strong, and then the whole Imugi thing was kinda whatever. Shout out to my favorite veterinarian Shin Joo though, that's bae right there! 😍",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

Over stuffed drama, immoderate romance, and crying scene every now and then made the drama hard to watch.",negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"The character development and the script writing was phenominal. The writers did such an amazing job writing the lore and the story. But, there is a little problem that the chemistry between the male and female lead was not as good as it should been. For example, in the kissing scene there is no jaw movement and he didn't even hold her neck while kissing which adds a lot. Nevertheless the drama was excellent compared to others.I have watched a lot of kdrama and this one is atleast top 3 compared to what i've watched. Also the music was really good but they should've added some vocals like in goblin which could've made it much better. Although the ost is really good but definetly have room for improvement.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

I deathly waiting for remaining episodes with all 👀.season 2 also more interesting may it also attract more fan base. When compared to season 1 and 2.its not possible to tell which one is better and best because both are tied up our eyes. One is romantic, thriller, suspens, emotions we can see there. Season 2 is mostly thriller.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"When I watched it for the first time, I really enjoyed this Korean drama series: Tale of the Nine-Tailed Fox, everything about this series is amazing. That's why I couldn't understand why other viewers find it bad hehehehe. I could totally say that this is one of the best fantasy kdrama. All actors are great in portraying their roles and the storyline is quite amazing tho. Especially Kim Bum who did an amazing comeback, he did a great job in portraying Lee Rang and it suits him well. BTW, his really handsome here I can't take my eyes on him hehehe I agree with everyone that he really steal the show. What I really love in this drama is the Lee brothers love hate bromance, action scenes, Lee Rang and Suho's interaction and all the supporting casts scenes, they really brought light in this drama amidst the main characters dark story. Lee Dong Wook and Jo Bo Ah has a good chemistry but not too good tho. I also love their story but not as much how I love the brothers and Suho. I hate how Lee Rang sacrifice himself huhuhu I cried a lot on that scene.But! This review was when I watched it first, but when I watch it for the second time, my re-watch value is only 5/10 and that is for Lee Rang, Lee Dong Wook's acting and the supporting casts. Because they really make the show interesting. I feel annoyed on Lee Yeon and Ji Ah's romance scenes, like they really don't suit each other, because of that I understand why other viewers don't like their pairing hehehehe. I skip their romance scenes and keep rewinding scenes with Lee Rang on it hahaha.I could say that you could enjoy this drama in a one-, time watch. If you re-watch it, skip the romance scenes so you won't be annoyed hahaha. If you like dark fantasy with family relationship this is really for you. If you haven't watched it yet! Give it a shot!By the way, there's a Tale of The Nine-Tailed Fox Spin Off, this is about the story of Lee

The plot also is interesting with a number of twists, including management arguments over what exceptions should be made to traditional rules, and how persistence can alter things. There are several romances here. Some of long standing with a few words for newer couples. Some facing adversity, both from each other, and from outside forces.It involves extraordinary powers and mystical surroundings, somewhat like My Devil, so you have to accept that aspect. It does not interfere with reality of the characters interactions and their differences and their evolution.I enjoyed the whole thing and recommend it.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,I just watched it for lee dongwook. The first 4 episodes are good but let me tell u something. The story between Ah-eum and Yeon is much better than Ji-ah and Yeon. I felt the first episodes were good only because of Ah-eum. The last episodes are just confusing and filler episodes. Overall this drama is kinda overrated.,negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"
tt12879418,"I am not normally fond of the supernatural movies/series, but this one captivated me. It's more gore than regular K Dramas, there is even a bit of animal cruelty that I didn't like. The ""bed"" scene is more than usual as well, I it felt real. The last episode is very emotional so grab your Kleenex, and it's a mixed outcome.The chemistry between actors was great, and I felt the characters had been casted very well. It's also good acting, no one stands out for all the wrong reasons. I am not sure I understand the relative low rating in comparison to absurd storyline and overacted like The King The Eternal Monarch.I am definitely watching season 2!",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

Can talk about much more Korean's tales with Gumiho battle with them.Think that Gumiho should remain Gumiho because lost all their knowledge and capabilities it's just really bad and sad.Maybe she could be reborn as a fox in the next life and then they'd been together for the time he'd longed to have with her without losing all their knowledge and powers.I don't think it's okay for a Being who has the wisdom of a mountain Spirit to become Human just to be a husband. It is anti-evolution of the spirit.Plus it's clear that he likes what he does and he's kind of already regretting being human.I love how this promove art in the world.

All the actors did an excellent job, there was so much mystery and suspense in this series, secret after secret getting revealed, twists and surprises, a captivating, touching love story and the story of the two brothers was just as wonderful. Loved the development of the characters, all their chemistry, the side characters and in particular all the characters' back stories, the folklore so woven into the modern times, the OST that was beautiful too and that I'm still listening to... The storytelling was also outstanding. Episode 9, actually starting in episode 8, was without any doubt some of the best TV episodes I have ever watched in my life, it was unbelievable. I rewatched the whole season immediately after finishing it. I don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a series, it's like I got immersed in a different world. I'm very happy about the ending, too, it was just perfect.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

As soon as I finished season 2 ""1938"" I looked for season 3. I'm not a theatrical guy like Crouching Tiger Hidden dragon so this played right into my kind of movie/story and action sequences with fantasy mixed in. This is always feeding into ""there's more to the story"" and the ending episodes of 1938 show that these characters are always evolving whether it be in personality or fantasy. Just give it a chance so they'll make a season 3 for those that want the ending we've put in the time and investment in.",positive,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

The main characters were good enough and I know I was hoping for all the ""couples"" to get together. Even when his brother was reincarnated, that was a nice touch.The female lead did a nice job going from sweet and cute to evil facial glares. I'd guess that the cast had a good time filming it.

I don't write reviews but I do put a score on shows and as I putting down a score, I was pleasantly surprised to see there was a season 2 on Prime. It is so much better than the 1st season!

tt12879418,I gave this drama a 4 start rating because season 1 was excellent and had a great story. With that said season 2 was a big let down. It was confusing more than anything. The writers really should have just stayed with season 1 and ended it. It was the ending that left no questions. If you're going to make another season at least make it make sense.I watched all season 1 but could only get through episode 2 season 2 as it just wasn't right. Maybe I'm missing something that others get. I'm not a big time travel fan so that could be what has made me so critical of the second season. Now others may feel different than I do but this I just my opinion.,negative,"Fantasy, History, Horror"

Kim Bum portrays his role rather earnestly.The story was intricately woven, the direction was commendable, the background music is so apt.The show had some nods to Lee Dong-Wook's character in Guardian- The Lonely and the Great God, with a few other similarities.

You got ""Fox"" Brother and half brother battling it out. Although this seems to be more of if the writer preferred Sesshoumaru as opposed to Inuyasha, but I like that it has a similar feel and the story is so powerful and fun.The romance is sweet and swoon-worthy.Fantasy wish there were more fantasy elements though

tt26693803,"Hey, first off, gotta say I'm a huge fan of Junho. I've been a fan since way back when he wasn't even a debut actor yet, just a singer in 2PM. And I've been blown away by the movies he's been in. His intense and emotional gaze just gets me, you know? That's why I was super hyped for the release of ""King of the Land."" I pictured it as this totally fresh and awesome film. But then they had to go and cast Yoona as the female lead, and I gotta admit, I was skeptical. Yoona's always been more of a side character, never really convincing as an actress. So when the movie came out, I jumped right on it and watched it on Netflix. But by the second episode, I was like, ""What is this? Yoona's character is not cute and innocent like they're trying to make her out to be. She's just annoying, hanging around her boss and not even admitting when she does something weird like using the VIP restroom. And don't get me started on her rude behavior at the staff party with all the top executives."" I couldn't take it anymore, so I stopped watching for a few episodes. Then, everyone starts raving about it, so I thought, ""Okay, let's give it another shot."" But honestly, the storyline was still the same old tired stuff. I saw some stills of an Arab prince falling for the main character, and it made me think about how Korean dramas always make their characters so over-the-top and create these unrealistic situations. Now there's a big backlash because it misrepresents Arab culture. People need to look at this movie more objectively instead of blindly supporting the two main actors just because they're die-hard fans.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I am American and this was my first k-drama. There was a lot of culture shock and confusion for me all the way through the 16 episodes. This is a very different style from any American show I've seen. There were silly sounds played to enhance the comedy which really turned me off at first, I eventually just ignored it as I think this just might be cultural. Outside of that, once the two leads start liking each other it got very cute. I found myself smiling as I watched them. I would say it takes awhile to get good, it's probably around the 10th episode where it gets really cute and fun. I found myself drawn into the main actor he got better every episode.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

( heartbreaking when I watched Squid Game! ) he was fantastic here too)I like the chemistry between the leads and you will be glad to find NO dead fish kisses in this drama whatsoever.And the die hard friendship between the three girl friends and how they are always there for each other was awesome as well.Overall very enjoyable!

The male lead's character is a shining example of all things charming and endearing, making it impossible not to root for him. The drama's ability to evoke genuine laughter after a prolonged absence is a testament to its delightful writing and exceptional performances.

It's cute and leaves you feeling fluffy and happy. I would recommend it if you're in the mood for something simple like that.I'm currently on the vacation episode and it's so fun. I also think that that the show does a good job of showing how corporations poorly treat their employees and how working hard does not always equate to success. So, even within the fluff, there's a nice message forming. Plus, the two main romances are quite cute.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Ugh , she is awful , the charachter that is !It does start off a tiny silly but boy it sure blossoms into the most beautiful romance. I highly recommend .

You may also notice a lot of reviews from Islamic countries due to this controversie. The rating is not an accurate representation of the quality of the series. However, do not be discouraged to watch this if you are not Muslim! For most people this series will score a solid 7 at least and should rank somewhere between 7-8 probably.It is an enjoyable serie with good acting and some humor and plot twists and turns. Sure, it is not the most original plot or innovative and apparently not even culturally appropriate but it is an enjoyable watch that will satisfy most RomCom and Comedy Drama watchers. The quality is on average still way above most hollywood series and movies nowadays too.In short, feel free to watch the first episode as it is fun to watch and a good representation of the overall quality of the series. I am sure you won't be disappointed! Again, if you are Muslim perhaps skip this series as it is not for you and you and you may feel like it severely misrepresents your culture and customs.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This show introduces a little, and ever episode introduces a little more.The chemistry of this story is basically Mary Poppins in a dog-eat-dog world, some far-fetched though passable events that make for escapist storytelling, and the Little Women theme of surviving in the modern world.It wouldn't be a KDrama if the handsome lead didn't meet up with the most gorgeous gal in the world... who has a BF.Again, the first couple episodes are OK, but the story gets more interesting.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"The first two or three episodes start a bit slow. This kdrama ticks off all of the tropes for a romantic comedy. I really enjoyed this one and at first I thought I might not because the first episodes were a little slow. But as you get further into the show starting about episode 5 it really begins to soar and that's when I really started to enjoy it. I did not like the side characters who worked at the hotel. They were all rude, and meanspirited. After a while it became really irritating to see people at so rude and mean. But things start to improve with some of those characters later in the series.I really liked Mr. Gu's assistant, who was a lot of fun, but I felt he should have ended up in a romantic relationship with Miss cheon's friend (the one who had the daughter and the lazy husband.) I felt she should have divorced the lazy husband and married Mr gu's assistant, who she seemed more compatible with. They hit it off so well I thought they would end up together. So in the end that whole side plot with the lazy husband was completely pointless. He didn't change a bit. Instead, because Mr. Gu's assistant did not have the standard kpop face and hair, his character was not given a romance like the other characters. And best friends of the central characters. The mother and daughter deserved more than that lazy man. Mr Assistant was available and open to love, so why not? That was a missed opportunity.I loved the trip to Thailand. That was a fun diversion.One of the characters I didn't like is the father, who seemed a bit oblivious of his daughter and her vicious antics towards his son. She was just a terrible person. In k-dramas, I am so sick of these really bad people getting away with everything and not having consequences and not being held accountable. Other than that this was a lot of fun. I hope people give it a chance because it's definitely watchable and I could really watch it again. And I'm a tough critic, usually.This was a very fun very light and very very romantic kdrama and I enjoyed it immensely and recommend that everyone watches it. I was surprised by how mature and open-hearted the male lead was and how romantic the story turned out. Well done.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I was genuinely surprised to see low ratings for this show. I think many people drop it after the first few episodes and to be fair I almost did too since it was a bit slow boring. However, the show picks up around episode 3 and I found myself liking the show more and more each episode. The cast is great and there are a lot of funny moments. I think if anyone is considering watching the show I advise you to stick it out atleast passed the first three episodes. I can see why some people might have dropped it after only watching the first few episodes, but I'm glad I stuck it out because it got better.

Just finished the final episode and even though the ending is predictable in RomCom's like this, it didn't disappoint at all. Love the chemistry of the 2 leads, male Lee Jun-ho as Won the handsome, smart, determined, hotel CEO who hated smiles, especially fake smiles and .Im Yoon-ah as Sa-rang the sophisticated, smart, hotelier who works her way up from the bottom by being the best talent and always has a smile on her face. They both do a great job in their roles in this love story. Lee Jun-ho has a unique voice that makes him stand out from other actors. Plenty of sweet kisses, romance, comedy and friendships. I rate it so high because one of the few shows that was hard to wait a whole week for the next episode to air which is unusual. See alot of haters giving low ratings but we need to remember this is a fictional TV show, not a documentary. Never saw anything out of place or had any thoughts of anything wrong when I watched it and I saw every episode. Loved it. I notice it is on Viki as well. The side stories amongst had a few love stories too that all came to endings in the last episode.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I really liked the show.I am on episode 7 now and I think it's a cute and lovely story line. I can understand people don't like the rich guy poor girl story line, but I did not think that much trough with that in this show.The female character shows a lot of love for her job and passion, I think that's such a great thing about the show. And the male character changes and is inspired by this female lead and in my opinion is also a nice thought.Overall I think I did not expect this much hate in the reviews, I am really shocked. A lot of the reviews come from very experienced k-drama fans, so yeah maybe this show is not what u expected and see a lot but maybe for newer fans ore for fans who aren't into k-drama this much it's a nice show to watch!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"Fantastic rom-com reminiscent of old-school K-dramas like 'What's Wrong with Secretary Kim.' The simple yet sweet plot, hilarious comedy, and heartwarming moments make it a must-watch. Great chemistry between the leads, The strong bond among the three girlfriends adds an awesome touch. Im Yoon-ah shines with impeccable expressions and timing, making every scene enjoyable. The banter between the leads gets better as the series progresses. This show deserves a solid 10!

tt26693803,To be honest I am really surprised with the way anti fans are using this platform to demean the show. I think its probably because of the latest controversy over the show. But that doesn't give anyone the right to degrade the entire casts and crews hardwork.This is such a nice show. Most of the people are loving it. But its sad to see negative thoughts are overshadowing the positive views. If you want to watch a romcom then this show is for you. I have been laughing soo much during the last 10 episodes of the show. The chemistry between the leads are on another level. They are just perfect cast. It has a simple plot which they portrayed nicely.People commenting about polished scripts should know that almost 50% of the dramas have same plot.Please do watch the drama. Its really good.,positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I agree that the start was slow, but now I really look forward to it on the weekends and I'm smiling throughout the episode. Hate the plot all you want but the lead couple and other actors have done a great job. Love the development and natural style of the lead couple, and how they both are not perfect but developing their communication and really perfect together. The visuals are nice too. I really appreciate this drama, it gave me so many positive moments. Given the either 1 or 10 star reviews, I guess at least it doesn't leave you indifferent.",unknown,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"Upon watching King The Land closely, I noticed scenes strikingly similar to the Korean drama 'Encounter' starring Song Hye Kyo. In episode 12, the show portrayed a little girl losing and finding her treasured toy, mirroring 'Encounter.' While King the Land is enjoyable and thrilling, some viewers may question its originality and creativity in certain storytelling aspects. However, the captivating narrative, well-developed characters, and impressive production still make it an exciting watch. The fantasy world, stellar performances, and lavish sets add to the charm, despite the echoes of familiarity.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"The low reviews are quite shocking frankly. The chemistry between the 2 main characters is consuming and the development of the love story is both realistic and beautifully told. Tbh I've had it on repeat for the last week. It's just a nice simple love story set in the backdrop of a hotel and the other side stories are complimentary and very interesting. The show is also extremely funny, I had many laugh out loud moments... Particularly scenes including Mr No and the grandmother. In my opinion the show was cast perfectly. I'm very new to Korean drama but this has made me a lover for sure. Wish I could watch it for the first time again.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"A lot of fun humor between Lee Jun-ho and Yoona and between Lee Jun-ho and Ahn Se-ha who plays his assistant. Also loved the line from Jun Ho as he is leaving the palace: 'This place looks familiar' (reflecting on The Red Sleeve). Jun Ho, once again, demonstrates his ability to play any type of character. His immense talent may be one of the reasons for lower ratings as some viewers may have expected him to continue taking on more and more challenging roles, which this is not. Would have been better if the Arab prince was played by someone from the country he is supposed to represent. This is just a reflection of the extremely limited number of roles for foreigners in South Korean dramas. Beautiful, beautiful clothing and set design. The fake wedding was magnificent!!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I think this is a fantastic series! Im Yoon-ah just kills it in every scene, and I wasn't the biggest fan of hers either (she was just ""ok"" I thought in ""The K2""). Her facial expressions and comedic timing are impeccable, and she has laugh out loud dialogue with the male protagonist (who also does a good job).I noticed a lot of reviews seem to be about the early episodes, but later in the series some of the banter with her overconfident and jaded male protagonist is just great! The way she handles him, gently and amusingly mocking him at times is really well done.I have seen several KDrama's/Rom Coms not nearly as good as this one with MUCH higher reviews...so these reviews make no sense to me.Also, I typically do not care for the ""comedic duo"", or sidekicks many KDrama's have. They are often annoying or try way too hard to be funny. Not so with this series. The two women sidekicks have real problems, real stories of their own, but they are very funny in some of their scenes too. Also, the male sidekick to the male protagonist is great, and constantly gets away with needling his boss - which just goes to show that contrary to his front, the male protagonist is a ""good guy"".If you gave up, give it a chance again through episode 8, the banter is truly good between them.Just to be fair, there are a couple things I didn't like either. The Arab Prince, the Cliff Jump, etc. So it has its faults, but overall it's a great show and worthy of a ""10"". I will revisit this review after the series is over and adjust accordingly but if you like these types of shows you will NOT be disappointed with this one!I have reviewed over a dozen KDrama's and have a public list on IMDB of ones I have watched and rated, and most of the time I am very much in agreement with the overall ratings.

I value my 8 hour sleep before work but after watching 1 episode of this kdrama, I stayed up and binge watched 6 episodes. It's a funny and sweet kdrama, really well shot, with not too big holes in scenario. I wish it had a higher rating because it really warms my heart to watch it. I have been watching kdramas for years now and I don't say this about many of them: it's a really good one. Try giving it a chance before dismissing it.P. S. The music in this TV show is also really really good! 9/10! Highly recommend.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"This series had a great and strong start. The couple's chemistry was great from the start. The first few episodes were really great episodes, because they jumped right into the storyline without stalling. We also got introduced to some great side characters and their storylines.This series also had a great balance of comedy, romance and drama. King The Land is full of cute moments between the couple, but we also get to see comedic moments and some entertaining drama.The ending of this series was also really strong, but it came too late. The last 4-5 episodes weren't nearly as good as the first 10 episodes. Suddenly the story started to feel really slow and repetitive. The story could have ended earlier in my opinion. But I did like how the last episode tied everything together.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I am unsure why this show has such a low rating but to each his/her own. I really loved this series because with all the hell going on in the world, it was good to be taken away to a funny, romantic/fantasy like world to escape things. It's a bit cheesy but that's what makes it wonderful as I for one am tired of all the violent and depressing movies right now. It's good to just escape.The main leads to a great job and the message is simply to write your own story, follow ones dreams and love and be loved. It's kind of a throw back to the K-dramas of old which is why I loved it. The supporting cast is brilliant and funny and the twists keep coming. It also provides insight into the corporate world of South Korea and the politics that go on. I wish they would have done a little more with the older sister and had her soften up a bit earlier but better late than never.If you want to just escape and have good thoughts that make you feel good, then definitely watch this.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt26693803,I love watching asian series and i must admit this series has a lot of unfair bad reviews from the haters. I dont understand why because this series is really hard worked and the actors are playing very well. The plot is nice and even if it is a stereotype it is still nice and relaxing. I consider the score it got on imdb is totally unfair and i cannot help but wonder if is not deliberately given just to discredit the movie or the future viewers. What i think is that people dont understand this is not a serious series but a romantic comedy and they have to behave accordingly. So i for one totally recommend this series for those who want to relax and not think too much over a movie.,positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This was a first k drama in a while and I was worried oh how are they gonna treat this predictable plot, is the girl gonna be always ashamed for being poor? That was so not what the air time was given to, thank goodness! They focused on the individual stories as much as romance and brought out some really good acting, comedy, charm and coziness. It's a good show to binge. Also the male character treats the female character equally (unlike Business Proposal smh). Lastly, TY for introducing me to Junho! He is such a good actor and talented overall. I am like amazed by him after watching multiple drama and coming back to this and then his other work!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The story is wonderful and filled with so many sweet moments between the couple- they were so endearing there was no way you couldn't fall in love with them. Honestly, at the end I wanted to go back and see the series again. Both actors portrayed their role with so much sincerity and humbleness. They should do another series together- do much chemistry.

tt26693803,"There is much to commend this show as it is an uncomplicated romance/comedy. It appears to have attracted a lot of negativity in many reviews but please do not pay any attention to them. King The Land is far from perfect but it is no way a 1 or 2 rating as many have described. I found it to be cute in many ways, reminiscent of What's Wrong With Secretary Kim, but not quite Secretary Kim's appeal. So what went wrong? For me, there was too much emphasis on long kissing scenes, too many love song interludes (should I say interruptions?) which ended up making scenes repetitive.As in many Korean shows, the audience has to take the action with a rather large grain of salt and I refer to the helicopter ""rescue"" scene. If the writers had managed things like this even a little more realistically, it would have made the show better.And one further point, why on earth do the male characters in so many Korean shows wear obvious lipstick? If any directors out there read this, please stop it. It looks ridiculous and serves no purpose whatever, except maybe to highlight a fashion in Korea of which I am totally unaware.Finally, a big congratulations to the supporting cast. They were wonderful. That's not to say the main cast were bad, they did their job admirably with the script they were given.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I love it! The cast (leading and supporting) is amazing! The story is super cute. I don't understand the low rating here, for it's one of the best k-series ever, IMHO. There are lots of funny scenes, really hilarious. It's a story about love and true friendship. The highlights go to the main protagonists (both great-looking and charming), Sa-rang's best friends, Mr. No, Sa-rang's grandma, and Samir. Great show! When I started watching it, I didn't expect to get so hooked on it. I think Won's change was well developed. This character's evolution was beautiful to witness. Sa-rang, from the start, proved to be one memorable character, embodying noble values that are surely needed and rarely seen in our nowadays society.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt26693803,"I love the leads and will watch them every time. They and the rest of the cast worked hard, and they did have some good moments during the series. There were sweet love scenes and a wonderful scene between mother and son that brought tears. Junho nailed that emotional moment as he is an actor who knows how to be still and let his eyes speak for him. He can rise to the moment even with a bad script. But this drama was uneven from the beginning, even without the episode that offended many viewers and with a clumsy, dull ending. Those issues lie right at the feet of the writer and director. What a shame because the cast and audience deserved so much better.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"It is a beautiful romantic comedy. Hours just fly by when you are watching this.The show documents the lives of diverse characters unlike other shows which focus on only the main leads. It explores various forms of relationships from multiple levels: father-son, step siblings, employer-employee, rich-poor etc. The strong bond of true friendship among three young women occupies a good chunk of the drama.Overall, it is a fun-to-watch, moderately slow burn romance drama with a tinge of mystery interspersed.The actors have a marvelous job playing their respective roles and it has quickly become one of favorite shows.Hence, the rating of 2.4 out of 10 is utterly ridiculous and misleading for such great series.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I like both leads but even they can´t carry the boring plot. It has its moments but I just saw episode 10 and it is basically nothing more than a 60 minute marketing piece for Thailand. And, does the male lead ever work? His sister is the bad one but I am starting to feel sorry for her. At least she seems to stick around the hotel.

The support actors were equally good. Also, a little inside the hotel business was fun to witness.

It's your classic cheesiness, easygoing romcom with a plot that's easy to follow.

It had a slow beginning. First two Ep's didn't make me like the movie at the instant. I really got into it from episode 4 and now I can't stop. In the end, this movie needs patience.

tt26693803,"This romance/drama series, KING THE LAND, had everything a girl dreams of: Cinderella leading lady, handsome, rich Prince, his dominant Father, the King and an EVIL step-sister!! The plot was simple: poor girl works for HUGE hotel; young heir falls for her; love grows ever-so-slowly and they live happily ever-after. Of course there are always the side stories of the FL's best friends and the unconventional family of the ML.My likes:
Lee Jun Ho as I've not seen before: simply dashing in his more than 100 suits that fit him like a glove! He looked like he was truly in love with his leading lady and I felt that these feelings were real! (Real-life lovers) His character was consistent and sometimes VERY funny! Bravo!Yoon Ah was a first viewing for me. She portrayed her character with sweetness and naivety, but also showed inner strength in her willingness to ""leave"" her great job.The love scenes. FINALLY! Real kissing but kept clean.The best male buddy, played by comedian Ahn Se Ha. SO hilarious and yet showed so much love and affection for his boss. He made me laugh and cry in an instant.The two girlfriends played by Go Won Hee (Pyung) and Kim Ga Eun (DaEul). Their lives were not too complicated and their scenes together with the leads were wonderful!MY FAVORITE SCENE-STEALER: Grandma played by veteran actress Kim Young Ok. She does this in any series she's in!The Thailand episode. Thank you for the travelogue, writers!The overall production. Lots of money spent on this series as every setting was in multi-gazillion-dollar homes and hotels. The clothes, suits, uniforms...classy and well-designed.My dislikes: The scenes with DaEul's family. Totally cringe! That husband represented every male we ladies loathe. That little girl who had lines of a 40-yr-old! The do-nothing in-laws. Awful! Fast-forwarded all their scenes. The evil sister was so overdone. Can anyone really be that greedy?Overall...I laughed, I cried, I swooned, I drooled, I loved it!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"While you scroll the reviews, you may notice both extremes. Some have full 10 send and the others, 1. So keep that in mind: people grade shows based on different criterias.I gave this show a 6 because all the side plots weren't given enough support and structure into the main plot. It didn't feel cohesively written because they spent too much time with the relationship development.I can overlook a lot of cringy Kdrama moments, especially when it comes to dialogue, but I can't stand cringy plot moments. I felt like this show was set up to have a solid foundation of an dynamic, in-depth plot, but it they didn't do anything with it which is really disappointing and it ultimately made me bored.People might think Sa-rang was the main lead, I felt like Wong was because he had more unknowns about him.The main male lead (Wong) seems to have a tragic past with mommy issues (how original), but I was waiting to see how this came into play with the plot and how it would build his character. 10 episodes in, from what seemed would be a major part of the plot barely made any appearance. You almost forget about it until they allude to it once in a great while, but at that point I didn't really care anymore.Another great character development opportunity for Wong, which seemed to be the foundation of the plot, would be his newfound desire to take charge of the hotel and improve management. We get glimpses of this, but all of his motivation is rooted in Sa-rang. Everything he does is because of her, which, I guess depending on your view, could be romantic, but he doesn't have any personal drive, so he feels like a bored puppy just hanging around her all the time which is really boring to watch. The whole show poured its attention to the relationship aspect. I felt like the climax of the show was episode 8 when they became a pair. After that, I had no desire to keep watching because it felt like the point of the show was given.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I looked through reviews to see why this is rated so low. I will admit I initially was not hooked by the plot. Gu Won parachuting to the hotel on his first day made me think that they knew who he was, but they had no idea he is the hotel owner's son. He made friends with the guy who became his assistant, No Sang-sik, then and I cheered. Sa-Rang is just delightful because she is hardworking and likes her job. I find myself saying in my head ""Hermes"" when I don't feel like smiling. Overtime she and other characters change Gu Won's thinking about service. It reminded me of Maid in Manhattan.I saw that some people felt writers disrespected the people of Saudi Arabia. I did not see that because I took it to be more about the relationship between the prince, and Gu Won. A rivalry was there. It's not really about the country but about the character.What I like about Korean dramas is the stories are always multi-layered. There's often a backstory that we see you running throughout the explains the motivations of characters. I tried to think what it reminds me of, and it made me think of Victorian novels. You have class struggle and often one class learns from the other. The endings aren't always happy... but usually there is an epilogue.Oh, and most of these dramas are made up of foodies like me. What's not to love?",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"I'm not sure why I continue to fall into the trap of watching these romantic dramas that overuse cliches that have been done hundreds of times before. It's the biggest reason why I stopped watching American romantic comedies because they're mostly all the same. However, perhaps it's because I've seen enough refreshing takes on the genre in K-Dramas that I remain hopeful, that there are still a few gems out there. This series isn't one of them.Once again, we have the super-wealthy man who swoops in for the plain working girl. We've seen this duo so many times, that it's literally become tiresome. It's also insulting that women today-in any part of the world-are made to feel that the ""jackpot"" is still the rich man. Look around, and you'll probably find that many such relationships don't last or end well.There is little innovation or creativity in this series. It's about as predictable as you could imagine. Wealthy son has a problem, so he's a bit of a recluse. Wealthy son has a parent who is unhappy with him and, of course, he disapproves of the girl he likes and is told to get rid of her. Always a power struggle between the guy and a sibling or rival. Regular girl doesn't have much self-esteem and struggles to make ends meet. Regular girl begins to question her value as soon as any objection is made against her, especially by his parents. Wealthy guy miraculously recovers from his problem, usually with the help of the girl, and we see him begin to soften and see life in a different way. Wealthy man treats the girl to many exotic events that nobody could possibly experience (bought out restaurants, amusement parks, lavish hotel rooms, etc. As if this is the only way to enjoy each other's company. Everything is miraculously wrapped up in the last episode so that everything ends on a happy note.What we end up having is a very predictable series where we already know what's going to happen from the very start. This formula is used in nearly every Hallmark movie ever made. In fact, I wondered if the writer stole their template to use for this series. It wouldn't surprise me.The series could have been brave and chosen to go off in a totally different direction. Perhaps the guy gives up his wealth to pursue his own dreams and happiness. Or how about this? Why can't the woman be the wealthy one and the guy be the regular shmo? Because culturally, we still live in a world where women continue to believe that ultimate happiness lies with a wealthy man, which is beyond sad. It's pathetic because it's so completely untrue.Gu Won (Lee Jun Ho) is the reclusive son of a wealthy company and hotel owner. His mother suddenly disappears from his life at a young age, and he doesn't trust people who smile. He views such actions as fake as well as insulting as if the person is hiding their true feelings. He's not entirely wrong. There is nothing so superficial as a fake smile. He comes back to Korea after years in the UK to learn the business, even though at first, he has no interest in taking over.Cheon Sa Rang (Im Yoon Ah) is a young woman who's always dreamed of working at the King Hotel. It's a place of warm memories from when she was a child, and because of her customer service skills, she finds herself moving up the ladder to King the Land-an exclusive VIP floor of the hotel, only for the very richest of people who demand special service. She's very good at her job, and when she's asked to interview Gu Won for a promotional scheme, of course, there is immediate friction, especially when he demands that she stop smiling.As you can already guess, these two are whisked away alone (you have to hand it to the writers who scheme to come up with some plausible way to force these two characters to be alone in order to break the ice!), and they begin to learn about each other. The sad part is that by the end of the third episode, Gu Won miraculously recovers from his problem of seeing people smile. This is an area that could have, and should have, been explored much more thoroughly than it was. This was a missed opportunity.Cheon Sa Rang has two other friends who both work under the same company. Kang Da Eul works at a duty-free shop. And Oh Pyung Hwa is a flight attendant. All three women are very immature, cowardly, and weak. Wallflowers are never attractive or appealing. Sa Rang constantly allows herself to be abused at work. Kang Da Eul is abused by her in-laws and husband. It's sad that her little girl has more maturity than she does. And Oh Pyung Hwa has her past held against her, and she's also abused by the pilot and co-workers. None of them ever speak up and stand up for themselves.To be fair, Korea is arguably the most competitive country in the world. And what we see is a very cutthroat mentality in which workers are expected to fall-in and do whatever they're told without argument or complaint. This leads to a hierarchy of those above abusing those below. In one of the high points of the series, Gu Won attempts to correct this oversight. His plan is for companies to appreciate their employees and to treat them as valuable commodities rather than throwaways. This is a philosophy that is sorely needed in today's world, but perhaps especially in Korea. This point was actually my favorite aspect of the series, so it wasn't a total loss.Lee Jun Ho is the glue of this series. He has a very natural acting style that makes you appreciate his acting chops in nearly every scene that he's in, and in many ways, he single-handedly prevents this ""ship"" from sinking completely.I've always loved Kim Young Ok (Grandma) who dazzled us in ""Hometown Cha Cha Cha"" as well as ""Tomorrow."" She's a true delight in everything she does. I smiled when I saw her in her first scene.Im Yoon Ah is the weak link in this series. This woman is like a Jekyll and Hyde actress. She's either upbeat, bubbly, and warm, or she's cold, rude, aloof, and indifferent. She has no other ""speeds"" which is why her range isn't very good. She has no clue how to build up a scene. She can only hit one button or the other, which really hurts her performance. I found it ironic that she's the last one to smile in the wedding of the last episode. She looked so uncomfortable, and it showed. She has a good grin, but she hardly has ""the best smile."" Her performance is very inconsistent and lacking believability in many scenes. I certainly won't be watching any more series that showcase this actress. She's decent at best.Kim Sun Young plays Gu Hwa Ran, Gu Won's sister, even though she looks more like his mother. While she played the character well, Gu Hwa Ran is way too one-dimensional. This was another character that should have been explored with much more depth.Finally, we have Ah Se Ha playing No Sang Sik (Gu Won's assistant). There is a fine line between playing the idiot and playing the funny man. The buffoon is rarely appealing, and the Thailand trip was cringeworthy and easily my least favorite part of the series. It takes someone with real acting chops to toe the line between being annoying and funny. He was easily my least favorite character of the series, making me question why he was there.I prefer series like ""Business Proposal"" that showcased strong, mature women who could fend for themselves. Women who didn't act like wallflowers who wilt under every kind of pressure, which is what we have here. ""Hometown Cha Cha Cha,"" ""Our Beloved Summer,"" ""Touch Your Heart"" and ""Love To Hate You"" were vastly superior to this series. These writers really need to start thinking outside the box instead of hammering us with the same plots and weak characters that have been done to death.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"Junho is superb in this drama. It is sweet and endearing as the romance unfolds. The scenes between Junho and Yoona have me smiling from ear to ear because the chemistry between him and Yoona is fabulous!!!! I anticipate each episode!! The story line is simplistic so far (boy meets girl and falls head over heels) but the rivalry between ML and his sister is just starting to heat up, so I anticipate a good plot development in the upcoming episodes. The first nine episodes were really great, and I expect the remaining episodes to be just as good. I will be tuned in for each one! Keep up the good work!!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

(Ok that's a lie but I can dream). Junho is one of my favourite singers so I'm a bit biased, but then again Yuna impressed me in Hyori's Homestay so I kept on watching the series and haven't regretted it yet.The Middle Eastern Prince eps were obviously not meant to be anything but satire of a really SUPER rich person, so just chill and see the funny side of two enormously wealthy friends bickering for fun. (People all over the world stereotype Australians as all being outback weirdos like Steve Irwin and Paul Hogan, but no one takes that seriously enough to give 1 star reviews when they see the stereotype in shows).Anyway, a predictable fun show that is really only meant to be silly romantic fun.

After a shaky start they fall in love.Won and his step sister are in competition to take over their father's hotel and other enterprises - his sister will use any dirty trick she can to win the businesses.In one particularly silly scene Sarang goes to deliver goods up a mountain and gets stranded during a storm - Won takes a helicopter and it never explains how he got to the ground - he just appears and the top of the cliff and takes a flying dive down to a narrow ledge where she acts all frightened because she doesn't know who he is - the helicopter pilot says mission accomplished and flies off - leaving them both on the ledge all night!Just too silly.The story is very much marred by Mr No - Won's assistant who I suppose is the comic relief.He can't seem to keep his hands off Won and touches him at every opportunity.At one point on a group visit to Thailand - he arranges hotel accommodation with one room for the three girls and one room for himself and Won - this bedroom is covered in red rose petals with a heart of petals on the bed.What are we to make of that?Won goes mad - and I don't blame him - Mr No is a nobody who treats Won abominably throughout the trip.It is simply not believable that he would get away with this kind of behaviour - he would have been fired long ago.The rest is the usual tropes of a lost mother and the raising of Sarang to a small hotel owner rather than a concierge - though they never told us how she could possibly afford to do that.I ff'd through all of the board meetings and the experiences of Sarang's friends - they were simply there to make up the compulsory sixteen episodes.,neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

What were your expectations when you started watching? Because this show completely fulfilled mine. Its a very nice romantic comedy, with adorable cast. So sweet and almost zero cringe, unlike ""business proposal"" or ""love to hate you"", which made me cringe abundantly, and yet have unrealistically high ratings.Trolling should be banned.

'King the Land'It's another swoon-worthy, cute, sweet rom-com.Story is same old, rich guy-poor girl, how their hate relationship turned into love.It's very predictable, there is zero tention in the plot. There is zero novelty in the story. It's a mixture of many popular kdramas.All problems get solved easily. FL is too perfect in everything, and ML's only work is to woo FL somehow to accept him.Anyways, it seems, they made this drama for Lee Jun-ho and Yoon-ah's fans. And it made fans very happy. Drama does get into controversy over wrong Arab cultural representation. Apart from that, it's a time pass, stress buster, easygoing drama.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I love how she was not intimidated with power people around her and showed them grace at all times and same with her friends and what made him attracted and eventually fell in love. His character of bitterness changed because of her. And in today's society who keeps preaching 'be kind' but not practicing it ...this show showed a lot of kindness and grace and how she was able to influence people around her.

tt26693803,"I got on here to see the actors and what else they've been in and was SHOCKED to see a 2.something rating for this show. Like what in the actual world?! Are people that hardened that they can't enjoy a ""trope"" (sometimes a little corny) romantic comedy? Unreal. I genuinely wish people would just calm down and enjoy it for what it is. W/ everything in the world being either so dark that its unwatchable (world is dark enough on its own), or just ridiculously played out in the worst way, I think it's honestly wild that people can't just enjoy this for what it is...Rant over. I turned this on, randomly, and was sucked in immediately. It's simple, cute, clean, and fun. It's actually funny too. The actors are great, the leads are believable and have good chemistry.

Definitely am hooked.Hope they keep up the good work.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"If you are part of the herd, blindly obsessed with stars, then you blame the haters without seeing how badly this production is made. For those who saw the original from 2014, the production leaves the feeling of a counterfeit copy from the country that produces the jewelry advertised in it. If Yoona and JunHo, the professional grandmother, the professional old president, had not been cast, it would have been a total fiasco. Because: - it's terribly poorly written. - annoying with the insistence of product placement (Chinese jewelry for which the proposal scene was postponed, German cars, ramyun and others). Even scenes from other productions were copied, but inserted without inspiration. Which makes the direction bad. The editing is also, for the most part, deficient. Of course, as in these conditions, the acting of the actors seems to be at its best. For the level of Korean productions, the quality is terrible. Closer to Cinderella and Boss CDrama with Korean actors. Saved only by the fans' desire to see their beloved stars at the wedding.",,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"We began watching the equivalent of PG, PG-13 & PG-14 Asian dramas about a year ago and have delighted in the humor and the fact that the rom-com factors tend to be clean & highly respectful about what happens between a couple, and there's usually minimal language, if any, used in the sub-titles. Our favorite shows' last episodes have been able to magically wrap up the season AND end with a sparkling twist that leaves us with unexpected smiles on our faces over the creativity shown in those final moments. The ones that make the ""not quite favorites"" list generally have too much drama or sex outside of marriage and weaker endings. (FYI, if there's much language or sex, we mark it thumbs down and turn it off.)
King The Land was soooo close. Episodes 1-15 were super-strong contenders (minus the fact that there were lengthy kissing scenes - and there's generally only one place you can go from there). Sadly, episode 16 simply did not live up to the previous 15 episodes. In King The Land, after wrapping up loose ends in a fairly predictable fashion, and having our primary couple begin sleeping together outside of marriage, the ending itself was not the cherry on top, it was almost boring.Summary: we liked the actors, generally enjoyed the script and most of its twists and turns. Did not care for most of the final episode. We're hoping that the Asian market is not following U. S. trends by pushing the line of what's considered appropriate in the PG-x range of movies.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

He is an irresponsible playboy who is estranged from his family and has no interest in his fathers business. The series is incredibly well acted and with a great supporting cast all dealing with their own various problems. It has received criticism on two fronts, one being it is a rehash of many past dramas but I think that is part of the appeal as it's aim is to warm your heart with the nostalgic tropes.

I appreciate that the main characters didn't waver from their feelings and commitment to one another, HOWEVER, some of the female characters decisions in the last few episodes made zero sense. While I appreciate that the storytelling tried to accentuate that she wanted to fulfill her own idea of her dream job, it took away from the reality that she chose something that seemed like it wasn't even in the same city as her boyfriend.

tt26693803,"Firstly, the series doesn't deserve the low rating it has. The storyline is interesting, the 2 leads are fabulous and there's some very nice support from the supporting actors and actresses, notably Grandma.. It is a little overlong and tends to include some irrelevant padding, such that we often skipped a little to get back to the main story. The plot involves a girl joining a prestigious Hotel in Seoul and giving it her all to make a go if it. She meets the rather detached and brusque son of the chairman, who initially is very unlikeable, due to his difficult upbringing. He comes over as arrogant and unpleasant. However, gradually as he gets to know the girl, he starts to thaw and a relationship starts. As with all the Korean movies in this genre, it doesn't go smoothly, and they have to overcome many obstacles. However, the chemistry between the leads is great and they make a very believable couple. The ending rather spoils things and is a mess with a will they/ won't they theme running. That made me drop a star, but otherwise there was much to enjoy in the series. I certainly wouldn't pan it as some have done.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This show for the past 8 weeks has just given me so much joy and laughter.The chemistry between the two leads was off the chat, Yoona and Jun-Ho were made for the roles. The OST, was amazing, the storyline was perfect. It's a romcom, so of course it's going to be filled with cheesy moments. That's what it's there for. I'm just so gutted this show has come to an end.Every Saturday and Sunday, I would look forward to King the Land. There are scenes that'll give you a tear, that'll have you laughing out loud, that'll want to make you punch your screen.

Good thing they're both good looking but both of them had zero chemistry at all.If I could rate this a little more than 1, I would.

It is a stressbuster and if want some feel-good time, my advice would be to definitely watch this drama and have a good time. So...Hermes (Smile) !!!!!!!!!!!!1.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"This show fails to bring anything new to the table, lacking originality from start to finish. Episodes 5 and 6 were particularly disappointing, leading me to lose interest entirely. As a dedicated K-drama fan, I can't help but feel let down by the lazy writing and direction employed by the team behind this production. Even the talented actors cannot be excused for their involvement, as they had prior knowledge that this format offered nothing innovative or fresh.The choice of using a hotel as the central theme has been overdone countless times before in Korean dramas such as ""Lie To Me,"" ""Encounter,"" and ""Hotel Kings."" It remains unclear why hotels seem to be an incessant source of inspiration for storytelling in Korean society. The attempts at comedy felt forced throughout, lacking any sense of naturalness. In fact, background sounds were even used excessively in an attempt to enhance comedic moments - a cringe-worthy decision.Regrettably, after enduring six episodes with little enjoyment or engagement, I have made the decision not to continue watching this series. Six episodes proved sufficient enough for me to provide an honest review that reflects my disappointment with its lackluster execution.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"The drama is quite good and worth watching, because in terms of the story about romance between superiors and subordinates, the difference is that if you are an ordinary office employee, if this is a hotel boss and a hotel employee, they will fall in love because their players are very supportive, both of them are already unfamiliar with the experience of the two, for sure. Makes you interested in watching and will make you wait when this drama airs besides the story also the mv also supports ad like a punch that hurts the mv and in my opinion overall this is a good drama.so watch it, welcome to this love story, hope you enjoy it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"Okay so, I have seen the poor rating of the show and the mixed reviews.I'll give you my honest opinion about the show. If you're undecided about whether you should watch this or not, please read this.King the Land is one of those shows that don't take itself seriously. And for it's genre, i'd say that it's pretty good.You see Cool and beautiful locations, good looking actors, it can be funny at times. Everything is made to make you have a ""Feels good"" moment. And it works. If you're in the right mood for it.For me, TV Shows are like food. It's actually like food in a lot of ways, we consume them.And most of the times, sure, i'd go for some high quality steak but sometimes, i'd rather go eat some junk food.This show is for when you want to watch something more chill, cute, light. If you're in that mood, you'll likely have a good time.If you try to take this show too seriously and compare it to other giants.. Well, it wont do as well.About the actors, I think that they're all pretty good, down to the minor characters.So all in all, a really good show.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It's a very lighthearted and cheesy kdrama, the actors have chemistry in my opinion and I can't wait to see more of it! I don't understand why it gets so many bad ratings, it's definitely not the best but not the worst either, and you can clearly see they wanted to deliver an easy to digest show, perfect for a lazy weekend. The cinematography is also very nice, again with quite some cheesy shots that may not be for everyone, but this kind of drama definitely has its appeal.

I read many reviews of this and I saw people writing boring plot and no drama and thriller, my limit was reached when I saw a review writing there are no love breakup in this series. He/She literally said that this is boring because love story is not complicated, not full of misunderstandings and fights. I cannot accept this, I personally have seen many series full of drama but I personally request that people who like those type of drama plase dont watch it and give bad review. For me its one of my best masterpieces with a simple and heartwarming story, Good characters and veryyyyy loving.In the end, I would say this masterpiece is made for those who are tired of twisted thriller plots and want some feel good and loving stuff.Thank you for reading my review.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Because this drama is more than a romance genre - it also tells the story of how the hotel industry works behind the scenes and shows how customer service can be improved by going the extra mile - as demonstrated by the female lead, Choi Sa Rang, the best talent - especially presented at the latter part of the story. Overall, a good show and not too much of a typical romance story.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"The early episodes were unbearable to watch. I've noticed that the writer and the production team are trying to make the drama comical, but the comedy is a hit-or-miss. For me, it's sadly a miss. I find it cringe and forced.Beside the comedy, I also don't like the fact that our main leads always seem to be ""accidentally"" in the same place, at the same time:
Standing basically two meters away from each other at the hotel lobby AND THEN walking away at the same time just for the sake of the slow-mo effect without noticing one another.Remember that time at the park, where they AGAIN were standing just a couple of meters away from each other looking at the beautiful city skyline. Why THAT park? Is there something special about the park? Because you can see the city skyline from other places too.They were also standing on the balcony outside their respective hotel room. And guess what? They did it AT THE SAME TIME.In 2023, I thought we already went past that cliché. I can tolerate if they do it maybe once in a while, but in each episode? I'm not sure.It is truly disappointing since out of all the upcoming dramas, I was looking forward to King the Land the most. I trusted Lee Jun Ho and Yoona, but now I'm questioning their judgement on this.I end up dropping this series after episode five. I really do hope that the upcoming episodes will be better than the previous ones tho cause there's a chance I might want to pick it back up in the future. And if in any way, you find this drama enjoyable, I'm happy for you :) It is just not for me now.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"For those saying that only fans of the lead characters will enjoy this show, I disagree. I loved King the Land and had no idea that either of them were idols until after the finale aired. KtL was quirky and fun, with lots of fluff and without the major life ending doom seen in so many dramas. There are some mild hurdles that have to be overcome in this romcom, but it was a relief to watch something that didn't leave me in tears toward the end of the series. If you want to unwind with a heart warming and humorous story, I would recommend watching this. It's one that I will definitely be watching again in the future.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt26693803,"""King the Land"" is a TV series that fails to deliver on its promises of engaging storytelling and talented performances. With a recycled and unoriginal plot, viewers are subjected to a monotonous narrative that offers nothing new or captivating. The actors' lackluster performances only add to the disappointment, as they fail to bring depth or authenticity to their characters. The pacing is inconsistent, dragging the already tiresome story further. The production quality is subpar, with cheap sets and a lack of attention to detail.

I did not get the sister her character. But that's maybe the only point I didn't like.It was relaxing watching this drama. If you want a nice relaxing evening with a glass of wine with no over dramatical scenes just watch this.Try at least a few episodes before making up your mind.

tt4925000,"It's an inspired Korean television production, with an enjoyable romantic plot, well written dialogue, good acting and adequate budget. As of April 2016 it has been streamed more than 2.3 billion times and its Asian success is so huge that China's Ministry of Public Security posted an official (and threatening) statement to warn against the growing influence of Korean Dramas on Chinese youth.It's obviously for kids but it can be interesting for anyone willing to know how is it to live now in South Korea, what does it mean to be pretty, young and cool there.But besides that, the story is catching and well made, with pleasant moments, nice sceneries (a great part has been shot in Greece) and good attention for details. Interestingly, Authors felt the need to account for the age difference between the beautiful Song Hye-kyo (born 1981) and the handsome Song Joong-ki (born 1985), even though I wonder how many of us would have noticed I'm liking it and I think that others from Western Countries will like it too.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"This sixteen part Korean romance is centred on Yoo Si-jin, a captain in the Korean Special Forces, and Dr Kang Mo-yeon, an attractive woman he meets when he and his friend Master Sergeant Seo Dae-young take an injured young thief to hospital. He is immediately attracted to her but she suspects he caused the man's injuries. That misunderstanding is resolved and they start to see each other; things look to be going well then he is transferred to the fictional Balkan country of Uruk. That might be the end of their relationship but soon afterwards Dr Kang and her team are tasked with running a field hospital in Uruk. This reunites the doctor and the soldier. They end up facing several dangers together; most notably an earthquake and confrontation with a criminal gang led by a former comrade of Yoo Si-jin. There are other romances; Master Sergeant Seo Dae-young is in an off-and-on relationship with First Lieutenant Yoon Myung-ju, whose father, a general, doesn't approve her seeing an enlisted man.I really enjoyed this series; it provides a fun central story which includes some fairly tense scenes as well as lots of laughs. In most episodes there are moments of danger although, for the most part, one won't fear too much for the ultimate safety of our protagonists. The cast is really great; Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo have a real chemistry as Captain Yoo and Dr Kang... it wasn't a huge surprise to learn the pair later marred in real life! Others are fine too; including the more minor characters. The Greek locations, filling in for the fictional Uruk, are impressively beautiful. It is fairly light hearted and requires some suspension of disbelief; I'm sure anybody with real military experience would laugh at the casual behaviour of soldiers depicted here. Over all I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes a solid romance story with a decent amount of action.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"Descendants of the Sun is one of those epic series that pretty much has it all: action, comedy, dire moments, touching moments, heart-breaking moments, suspense, intrigue, romance, and some dynamite plot-twists to satisfy most viewers.The series tells the story of a South Korean special forces officer, Yoo Shi-Jin (wonderfully portrayed by Joong-ki Song) and the civilian medical doctor, Kang Mo-Yeon (Hye-Kyo Song), whom he develops feelings for. So, how does a man, whose job is to take lives in order to protect others, makes a relationship work with a woman who is sworn to save lives, no matter who they are or what they've done? That is one of the central themes of the series as well as Dr. Mo-Yeon's constant grappling with her heart over a man who is always putting his life on the line.Joong-ki Song brings a wit and charm to the very likable Yoo Shi-Jin. He never takes things too seriously except when the people he cares about are in danger. He has a wonderful sense of humor. He, and best friend, Sergeant Seo Dae-Young, seem to get into trouble a fair amount, leading to some fairly humorous situations.The equally charismatic Dr. Mo-Yeon is a woman dedicated to her work. She has dreams of becoming a professor but quickly finds herself in a situation that sends her and her medical team to volunteer in the war-torn fictional country of Uruk.What makes Descendants of the Sun special is that it never gets bogged down in melodrama. It never takes itself too seriously, but delves just deep enough to care about the characters and what might become of them. While there are a few tense situations, the series is equally light-hearted and, most of all, sweet.I can see why so many people around the world have quickly become enamored with the series as well as with its characters. There are enough moments to make you laugh, make you cry, as well as make you wonder and hope if it is possible for two characters in seemingly opposing professions to be together. It's a fascinating character study into this dynamic.I have only recently gotten into some Japanese and Korean shows, and for me, Descendants of the Sun is easily my favorite.

tt4925000,"The title song was what I heard first, which made me search for 'Descendants of the Sun' and read the plot which didn't have much to offer apart from a usual romance story. The person who showed me the song was speaking very highly of the drama and was even generous enough to provide the episodes. Then I started watching in gratitude mostly and to be honest, I didn't regret that for a moment - but the opposite!'Tae-yang-eui hoo-ye' belongs to the type of drama that carry a simple story but with its emotional scenes, heartwarming music and soft touches makes it remarkable and attaching to a viewer. It has powerful sub plots running alongside and the visuals including the cast as well as the venues are also an eye candy.What I liked the most in the story is not the main love story between Shi-Jin 'big boss' and Mo-Yeon - 'the lady doctor' (although it is also emotionally appealing) but the power struggle and the demanding relationship between Dae-Yong and Myeong-Joo. I beleive the actors playing those two roles have done more justice to the roles compared to the main duo. But overall the story is empowered and flows nicely with typical lover quarrels and romantic moments placed perfectly between occasional humor and action. Yes you read right, Action ! 
I'm not talking about the Adrenalin rush you might have felt when Myeong-Joo's recording was played on loudspeaker which was a much needed breakthrough that came with humor. But there were plenty of military scenes and rescue scenarios I was very happy to watch as a boy. One more reason to drop a star in the rating is the poor budget that the producers have got when they have such nice action scenes which are diluted with careless visual effects and props.But overall this drama is excellent as a love story because it has the perfect blend between pain-joy, hope-disappointment and expectations-reality which is true in a real world love story as well. Yes, there are some over exaggerated moments of romance or maybe action, but it is essential for us to bond with the characters, hope them to do things that we want and to take pleasure in them getting what we want( and occasionally not getting it to break 'our' hearts). It is indeed an emotional roller coaster ride for a spectator and I really liked it. Anybody with a heart , anybody who have loved before can relate to at least one small incident that happens between the couples in the drama and indulge in their own memories - which can be eventually painful - but we embrace that pain with love.The only exceptional and unnatural character developments that I saw are of the rich-kid doctor and the unearthly attractive tech-mech-doc guy. But that is tolerable ~ it's fun. It also had its emotional moments with bitter truths of life - like when the disaster struck power plant worker took a decision about his life, which is a nice touch additional to the romance, comedy and action in the story.So to sum up (+) typical but rich romantic scenes(+) humor that doesn't bore you(+) picturesque backgrounds ( I didn't know Urk was at Greece right till the end :/ )(+) last but not the least ~ Awesome music(-) can be improved action scenes(-) a bit more less filler plotsmakes 'Descendants of the Sun' a nice story to watch and a pleasant gift to share.

Having said that, more recent dramas by the same director (Prison playbook and Hospital Playlist) have done exactly that, producing two exceptionally, high quality, bingable dramas which will be watched at least once more (both got a 10 from me).What would otherwise have gotten a 10 rating, got a 6 because of the aforementioned cheese. The scenery was great, the witty comedy from the male leads was very sharp and well written.

It became a phenomenon in Korea and across Asia and the ""Kdrama"" world. In the process reviving the ""Hallyu"" Korean wave and generating a massive wave of tourism to Korea, recruits for the Korean army and even impacting vernacular speech in Korea.So how do you review such a massive blockbusting success?It begins with a genuinely heartstopping action sequence that will become a key element in the resolution of the drama and then switches to a typical Korean romantic comedy. Boy meets girl... girl instantly hates him... but we all know how it will end.Our hero is a special forces soldier and our heroine is doctor. Fate sees them thrown into a war torn fictitious country (actually locations were in Greece in some rather stunning locales).There is, as is usual a buddy to our hero who has relationship with the general's daughter and father does not approve. You know the sort of thing.Descendants of the Sun is not that original in its plotting but it has heart on a giant scale and a cast the is exemplary.And fate threw in a bonus that no-one could foresee. The genuinely beautiful Song Hye Kyo and her co-star the handsome Song Joong Ki fell in love ultimately marrying in 2017.Despite the sometimes trite story line and the unlikely elements in the plotting at its core it is a love story. And this is what becomes more and more genuine as the series progresses.It is the key romantic scenes between the two leads (and also those of the second couple of Goo Jin and Kim Ji-won) that set the screen alight.The scriptwriters have created dialogue that rings true and the actors bring it to life brilliantly. At times funny at times deeply romantic it is this that lifts Descendants of the Sun way above the ordinary and certainly above much that Hollywood has produced recently.So sit back and let the story flow and just enjoy the romance, the comedy (which is at times really funny and I don't find Korean humour usually that funny) and the action which is pretty intense at times.Descendants of the Sun is a great ride.And the ending? Well let's just say Vancouver and volcanos take some beating!",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

I only watched it to see why people loved it so much. Yes, the cinematography was superb. The leads were also great and personally, I like both of them and have seen their other dramas before. At least, the woman is not the usual Cinderella character and the man is not Prince Charming CEO type. However, the story of these two leads did not capture my interest. At least with You Who Came from the Stars, the story between the lead characters and the crime/thriller subplot were gripping enough to make me continue watching, though I did not like the way they ended the drama. I was not personally invested in DOTS despite the good lead actors. I know that many loved their looks and chemistry but for me it will take more than looks and chemistry to keep me interested. Even with YWCFS, I couldn't care less about the chemistry between the two leads but the alien concept and the crime/thriller aspect of the drama made a bit more interested. The story between the two leads in DOTS could have been better. For example, the soldier had to kill someone close to the doctor because he or she was a spy but the doctor needed to save that person because not only was that person dear to her but she had to save lives as a doctor---well, something like that to make the dilemma more interesting and gripping.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

I thoroughly enjoyed this one, totally worth watching even with the subtitles.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"I really, really want to like this show, but sadly the military aspect of it show they haven't had many advisor form the military during shooting of the show.I almost quit during the beginning, where SF soldiers were running a covert obs in a DMS USING light on their weapons... I just though OMG,Later on the main hero (a captain) is putting him self in danger during many different operations, where a normal officer would have had to be the commander on site and use his soldiers in those positions.And lets not forget the actors english - it's not very good. Special the main actor, whom at one point mention he has been a student at West Point, but hardly speak understanding english - like very one else.The main actor has so far been ""dumped"" or turned down four times by his love interested. And I'm just thinking: When will he get fed up about her? He is a good looking person and there are a lot of other women in the show, he could start getting interested in. Special the army doctor...But if you look beside all this and only focus on the drama and love story, it's not too bad. But the chemistry between the actors isn't that great - I have seen others Korean romantic series with much better chemistry.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"Unfortunately, I made the mistake of starting this one right after Crashing Landing On You. In comparison, this was too painful to watch. The acting couldn't compare, the chemistry/likability couldn't compare; the comedy couldn't compare; the foreign characters were incredibly cheesy (especially their tough-guy English and attitudes), etc. Although I tried, I had to abandon. Just seems that a much better script, with Jin Goo's (more serious, less trying to be ""Top Gun"" cool) character as the lead, would have been much better. Also, the lead female character in this wasn't as appealing (not as likeable, not much character growth/transformation). It may not be a fair comparison (given they are such different shows), but CLOU is a masterpiece whereas DOTS was more like a High School production.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

tt4925000,"I would give it 12 out of 10 if possible. It was a shock to find a Korean TV series on Netflix. Haven't lived in Korea since 1967. Not like the people I recall, but it's easy to become attached to these characters. Plots are like the Snake River: 6"" deep and a mile wide. The acting is often stilted and a major stretch, but at times the crew just bust out some great acting chops. Even though they all look like kids. It's cool hearing all the Korean and trying to catch words I understand. Too bad more scenes weren't shot in Korea to see what it looks like today. But the shots around Greece are beeeeeeutiful! Hard to keep up with acting and plot while reading text. Some characters are more like caricatures, especially the Captain. We have two Romeos and two Juliettes with a bunch of capable actors filling out the crew. Right down to the injured plant manager advising the doc to save the man with a forklift tine through his chest. Excellent cinematography, color, and site selections. They display the soldiers like the ""hard ROK troops"" I knew. But these have hearts and obvious feelings. Right down to the funny doc asking a nurse to delete his porn file on his laptop if he dies...which causes a middle age nurse to come unglued because files are dirty. Yes, a stretch. But the Korean mentality is unlike our American mentality in many ways. Must admit I love the Korean people (in general) today as much as I did when I lived there and served with the military. Too bad the North and South can't get along. This is one pretty series! My wife doesn't understand my attachment to the country, people, and my desire to see Korea again, but this series brings it all back. So well made.

This is the type of drama that has potential and the writers know how to fully unlock that; hopefully they'll even surpass my expectations. The story flow is great so far, with emotional yet playful chemistry between the two leads. Can't wait to see how this will turn out :).The chemistry between the leads are just so good. But I have this bittersweet feeling; definitely something tragic is about to happen and idk if my heart can handle it .

tt4925000,They say they are going to create a season 2 of this show without the main leads (son song couple). I do not know why they are doing that because the whole point of the show is about those two and that is why it is so interesting and fun to watch. If the two are not going to be the leads and apart of the show for season 2 and the rest of the seasons. There is no point in making the show anymore. You say that there schedules are busy if their schedule are busy start making season 2 when their schedules are not busy does not matter if it takes a while. I rather see them be the leads again than not see them at all in season 2 in the rest of the seasons.,positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"This show was great. It made me feel all the emotion in a good way. The actors and actresses did a great job acting. Their hair, makeup and outfits look very nicely that whole show. I like all them of the medical scenes in the show. The romance was good and they had great chemistry together for sure. The actors and actress worked super well together. The script was written well. I like that this was set in a differnce country for once that most countries don't tend to set stories in. That was very refreshing. It had lots of action. I could tell that the director put a lot of heart, passion and care into the show. It really shows a ton. It was very boring to show. There was lots of drama and things going on each episode. It was never once confusing. The plot of the story was good for the beginning of the series all the way to the end of it. Everything made perfect sense. I like that there was action, romance, medical drama, and military kinds of things in the show. I think it all worked well together and there was not one thing that seemd out of place. I recommend this show to everyone.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"Set in Korea and Urk (Greece) this is a romance with a main and secondary romance and a few minor subplots. There is a little action in each episode, but not much. Most of the conflict is created by miscommunication which is common with romantic stories.Probably did the best they could with a low budget, like using Hyundai SUVs for military vehicles, some with cloud-like camo and some with no camo at all. There are crazy things such as: a single armed man taking on seven armed men and winning, all without anyone being hit by a single bullet? Landmines move quite a ways due to an earthquake, yet the ground is undisturbed? You have a dangerous ex-special forces bad guy at gunpoint and you look down at the ground for two seconds while you remove your mask? Swallowing diamonds will cut your insides? The U.S. does not have any biochemical battalions (they do have biochemical labs). Wearing cheap face masks which aren't even pinched down on the nose to protect against a Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF, in all fairness I think this was on purpose to have better audio)? Two military men cowering on the floor when a patient has a seizure (in fairness this was in response to one of the military dissing a doctor for cowardice)? A vaccine for VHF (there is only one for the VHF of yellow fever)? You really need to suspend disbelief for this show, and I didn't list most of the crazy things I noticed, just a few. There is the typical over-acting which is very common in Korean dramas and Anime, but, in this show it isn't as much as many others. The Korean military is more honest and better at fighting than anyone else, enough to embarrass James Bond.But, I did finish it, so that says something. If you like K-drama romances with a little military action, then this is perfect for you. I have to admit I did laugh once when a female character said she didn't like one of the military guys because he looked too much like a girl. Anyone who has watched Anime or K-drama will know it is quite common to have androgynous characters, and the men often have more make-up on than the women. Nice to have a story acknowledge it. There is a little more tension and conflict near the end which makes it a little more interesting.Best not to expect too much and you will be fine watching this. Personally I would have liked more realistic action and more humor. At least they showed they could laugh at themselves with an in-your-face ending that breaks the fourth wall.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"It's my opinion, Kdramas are mainly focusing on chemistry between actor and actress and emotions. It wasn't a great storyline but hooked up to watch their cuteness and handsomeness. Not only first lead actors but also second lead actors chemistry hits hard in this drama.Ost, chemistry, bromance, emotions, action are worked out so well.

It's a bit sad to know she and her ex husband Song Joonki got together because of this drama but they didn't last long.

But how was that linked to the story? What was the point of showing that.4. I am only watching how the army people and the doctors help in times of earthquake.

I love action with a bit of romance, so this show was perfect for me. The setting includes the army, and the words that comes out of the soldier's mouth seems to be written by an actual soldier, making it emotional (not full on bawling, but for me it makes me look up to people who serve in the army).

There are several reasons for this - spectacular locations with great cinematography, amazing soundtrack and the perfect cast. The cast was especially impressive in their acting abilities and none of the actors disappointed. This is one of the few Korean shows where the subplots are just as enjoyable as the main story. The pacing is also good and I did not need to skip through any of the scenes. Although there are a few implausible moments, it is a riveting drama and definitely worth watching (preferably on a marathon)!

They have the timing figured out, their dedicated at their jobs but they still have time to think about the other person and go thru all the worries of falling in love.I saw much more humanity this time around above the obvious. The writers did a super job and now that I can sit back and analyze it more, it really was a lot for this couple. And, the group as a whole unit.If you've ever been in the military or at a military school environment you can feel the close bond with the group; the soldiers and the doctors. It's a feeling like no other and I liked being reminded of that.There are some beautiful views of the island where there are also a lot of mines left.

tt4925000,"Average and underwhelming Kdrama that fails to live up to its initial hype. Despite its promising premise of combining romance and military action, the execution falls flat. The characters lack depth and development, making it difficult to truly invest in their stories.The plot feels formulaic and predictable, following the typical romance tropes without adding anything fresh or compelling. The dialogue is often cringeworthy, filled with cheesy lines that detract from any sense of authenticity. The attempts at humor are forced, resulting in awkward moments rather than genuine laughs.The chemistry between the leads, Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo, is surprisingly lackluster, failing to generate the sparks necessary for a convincing on-screen romance. The military backdrop also feels superficial, with the action sequences lacking the intensity and realism that the show aims for.The production values are decent, but they can't compensate for the lack of substance in the writing and character development. The drama's pacing is uneven, leading to episodes that feel unnecessarily dragged out.This drama may have garnered attention due to its star-studded cast and initial buzz, but it ultimately falls short of delivering a memorable and engaging viewing experience. With its generic plot, shallow characters, and lack of chemistry, this drama is a disappointing addition to the world of Kdramas and is best skipped in favor of more compelling options.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

However Some characters were unnecessary I think, I feel they were inserted for the sake of having more popular korean actors in it. Anyhow no big deal.Cinematography,, backdrops were stunning, I think they shot scenes in Greece. Effects were not perfect but considering this was produced 7 years ago, still its not a big deal. I have seen worse special effects on recently made series.Plot, well, for 16 episodes this series definitely not boring.

tt4925000,This series suffers from the sixteen episode syndrome. It's just too long for the content.Two soldiers in Special Forces fall for two women - one a doctor and one the daughter of a disapproving military father.The series portrays the romantic problems of both couples.Scenes take place in a civilian hospital and a military base hospital set up in the fictional country of Uruk.There are some well done scenes of military clashes and an earthquake which causes a building to collapse.Of course there had to be the long separation of the lead couple.What marred this series almost beyond endurance was the never ending references to how pretty the FL was - how handsome the men. This is prevalent in Korean series - both men and women are forever stating how handsome/beautiful they are - they should realise that self praise is no recommendation.The ending was ridiculous and made a nonsense of all that went before as a minor character asked the camera do you like this ending.What on earth was the director thinking? It made a mockery of the entire series.,positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

I liked the fact that the movie was patriotic and stressed the role and responsibilities of doctors.The 4 main leads all had great chemistry with each other, both the bromance and romance sides of thingsI particularly like ML Song John-Ki. He did a great job with both the serious and comedic aspects of his role. His kind of naughty grin was pretty awesome :-)There were some well written and well acted emotional momentsWhat I did not like so much:
Overall the story was a bit weak. Too many deadly situations, one on top of the other, lost the series credibility.I noted I liked the patriotic themes, but at times it was a tad too heavy handed.I won't spoil the ending, but I felt the ending was simply weak. I did not feel it ended on a strongly engaging note.Then there is kind of a second ending, which in itself is kind of weird. But it totally flopped for me, and deflated my feelings. I was like, ""What the heck?"" Maybe it seemed like a cute ideas to the writers but gads.Overall:
It is definitely worth a watch. I liked the whole cast and especially the 4 leads, but it is a bit weak and not rewatch material.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

I was a bit worried about whether it would end sad but it changed toward the end. It is a very serious, heavy movie as the topics are deep especially for those that were in the military or close relatives of those that were. As a war veteran's wife I found my self in tears multiple times and it brought back memories of those same feelings of worry and dread.

As my title indicates I kept watching for the sake of the second leads, they were mind-blowing and stunning in every aspect, from perfectly casted actors with great acting to an amazing chemistry that keeps you hooked, it also seems to me their story was more deep and understandable than the leads. The imaginary country where the story takes place is really weird, I failed to understand its identity, the people are a strange mix, first you see European and African kids then American people, Asian workers, the language is a mix of Arabic and Greek?!! And why there is a church in the middle of the military base?The hero is a soldier/superhero who can by himself and his fist defeat a group of armed gangsters (wow what a man!) heals magically from several injuries and shots. The actor doesn't give off the vibe of a high ranked soldier considering his young looks. His jokes didn't make me laugh but rather than that it's him speaking English, I couldn't take him seriously especially when he threatens someone, he looked like a funny silly cartoon character. The heroine is a doctor/super doctor who can in 5 seconds diagnoses a rare virus from trivial common symptoms, the medical part is silly sometimes like when they did surgery in open air at a construction site filled with dust after an earthquake! But it's a drama so everything works out perfectly and everybody is healed and happy. In a side note I liked the bromance of the lead and the second lead it adds a pretty good taste to the drama.In the first episodes there is this important Arab ambassador it was all fine until he started speaking...what kind of Arabic is that dude? As an Arab myself it bugs me and irritates me, I've watched a lot of shows and films in so many languages but I can't remember a single decent portrayal of an Arabic character, it's always a person wearing an Saudi scarf (as if all Arab men wears that) adding a poor speaking of the language (ALWAYS) to the point I myself a native speaker fail to understand what the hell they're saying. Just why? Like it is not that hard to cast someone who can actually speak Arabic (worldwide there is more than 400 million speakers of Arabic) but yet here we are...
In all I don't recommend this drama unless you're interested in seeing a wonderful heart-warming side romance of the second leads.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,K dramas r usually popular for showing overwhelming love stories that doesn't quite happen in real life but this one is perfect. It's normal to end a date at a ROOFTOP or just in the beginning of A MOVIE DATE or apologising for the FIRST KISS instead of confessing love or just leave without saying goodbye. It's normal to fall apart for a couple because of how difficult their life is. The more K dramas I watch the more I think that where was I for 23 yrs of my life?

tt4925000,"To be honest, what made me love the story is that I can see my ideal self making the same decisions as the main characters' and I can feel for them, too. Although Yoo Si Jin was too cute and playful to be a highly ranked soldier, Song Joong Ki portrayed a perfect blend of the traits of such an ideal man.Since Si Jin's attraction and acceptance to Dr Kang has been established from the start, the whole series seemed to revolve around Dr Kang trying to reconcile her moral standard with that of Si Jin's. I thought the earthquake and other calamities/dangers (which were quite too many) was used for this to happen, so it was disappointing that the problem suddenly shifted from a moral/ethical issue to a question of whether she can handle the anxiety or not and that she only needed to hear Myung Joo's source of courage to pursue the relationship. It would have been more acceptable if the shift was because she was starting to fall for Si Jin, but she has also been attracted to him from the start. Moreover, I did not catch how Si Jin and Dae Young healed from their wounds and maintained their fitness for one year.It is satisfying to have the side characters' stories to be developed, too, and to witness the bromance between Si Jin and Dae Young. I felt like the involvement of a North Korean soldier in the plot was inserted to have someone save them, but his appearance nevertheless enriched Si Jin's character.

He was dedicated to the army and the country, while she was a highly dedicated surgeon, working hard in the hospital to save her patients' lives. She was a star in the hospital. It's a story of a soldier and a surgeon whose meetings always lead to a breakup because his job requires him to keep it a secret from everyone, something she does not like. However, when she finally learns what his job really is and how much he is dedicated to it, she falls for him even more compared to the last time.

tt4925000,"Descendants of the Sun is a phenomenal show. It is fast paced with beautiful scenic views and such heartbreaking moments that it takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. I happen to become far too invested in Korean dramas because I find their stories portraying so many emotions and such thought provoking ideologies that they keep playing in my head over and over again.
The lead pairs are spectacular. This is the first time ever that I have been equally invested in both the lead pairs. To me, both their stories mattered and I didn't mind that they paused each montage and showed me an insight into the other couple. Infact, I was equally curious and excited to know what happened to the other pair. The acting by every member of this show is so vibrant, I don't find a trace of overacting personally. Hollywood does that a lot lately, all the great actors feel that they're depictions are effortless and however they execute it, it'll be flawless but they're all drab. I don't know why and how, but Korean shows have ruined me for Hollywood and Bollywood. I really wish to learn the language to get more depth of the dialogues and grasp the emotions better but I must say the subtitles have been fabulous. There are times when they have used English phrases which, I beleive, capture exactly the same idea as the Korean ones and that is a mean feat.
One of the characters who made me cry the most was the rich doctor, Dr. Lee Chi Hoon. I felt his tears, deep within me. It was such a sensitive emotional turmoil to have to defend your flight-flight reaction. In that aspect, both soldiers and doctors have such high moral obligations and their struggles must have been relatable for everyone in the field and the people who know these daily life heroes.
That said, Sergeant Seo Dae Young exuded such authority that any girl who loves seeing army men would have her knees quivering. Captain Yoo Si Jin had the best smile and such grace that his body movements were flawless, even though he wasn't butch. It was a much more convincing depiction of an army man that Hyun Bin in Crash Landing on You (FYI - I love Hyun Bin but what's right is right).
Now the femme fatales, they're both gorgeous. Dr. Kang Mo Yeon had such a pretty face and she was so convincing as a doctor and her balance between wanting to endure heartbreak for the rest of her life vs saving herself, was justified in a lot of ways. I'm sorry, I only have good things to say, I'm just mesmerized. Lt. Yoon Myeon Joo is extremely extremely pretty. Her features are so delicate. I loved her in Fight for my way as well and here, she takes the cake with her character. According to me, love should be blind and fought for this way. It's so endearing to see the woman pack her bags and run helter skelter to be with her man. I know I'd do that in an instant for the man I love.
My problem with the show is that I started it yesterday evening at 5:00pm and its 2:00pm, the very next day and I have finished it already. I binge like a crazy person. I have no control on myself. And gosh, it was worth it but it got over too soon and that pains me. What a wonderful series. Truly wonderful.
P.S: The thief/private/sergeant is such a cutie and he acts from his heart. I just loved him so much. It makes you want to save everyone, no matter what their actions, every human is hopefully redeemable.
This is my first ever IMDb rating and review and I want to do more of this as I like having an outlet to put out my thoughts. Please do watch it, it's highly recommended. It will linger with you. Kudos to the entire crew, they all deserve high praise. Thankyou, this has been an adventure. Loads of respect and gamsahabnida!",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"I enjoyed the show except i had a very hard time understanding what was the main female lead's problem. The moral dilemma she built her rejection on (he was a soldier who takes lives while she was a doctor who saves lives) was not depicted in the story at all, quite the opposite actually. He was portrayed as a man with integrity and discipline and not some sort of killing machine she believed he was.
The picture was amazing and i was extremely surprised with the quality of the cinematography.
A few things that were probably a little over the top, for example him tipping the car over the edge of the cliff - this should have come with a warning not to try this at home, considering the hight from which they fell to the sea as well as the direction of the car, they would have been both dead from the impact. But our male lead just got his hair wet ;)
Also the mission at the end that goes side ways and we are left believing both soldiers are dead only for them to reunite again after a year or so via a walkie talkie.. that seemed too far fetched. Big boss was also probably the first 'under 30' soldiers becoming a major ;) but then, in kdramas everything is possible.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

The lead actress was shown and told as some angel or Cinderella but i did not feel that. Some of the episodes in the middle were bit boring and draggy. I loved the attitude of the villain David. I expected too much from this drama because of its high rating and all but it was not to that point. It was talked more than dramas like You who came from the stars, Healer, etc.... Due to these things I expected too much from this drama and felt a bit disappointed. Somewhere deep down the line is felt the story was predictable except the last episode.

tt4925000,"Excellent review and observations. Thank you so much. Just one thing, the age difference between Song Hye-Kyo and Song Joong-ki (four years) is insignificant. In America a great deal is made over this nothing. At least in S. Korea film regularly has romantic dramas with much larger age differences. The difference is that in American film and tv it is almost a cultural construct that every male who meets a girl is motivated solely or primarily by one thing, sex. You almost never see that in Asian, and certainly in S. Korean romantic screenwriting.S. Korean ""everything"" has taken over the world today. They truly are the descendants of the sun. The talent and confidence that exudes from S. Korean youth is exhilarating and inspiring. Everything from food, to fashion, to film, art, design, on and on, puts them at the top of the world. American parochialism has kept them thinking they're the best in the world, when they no longer are.I'm so glad ""Parasite"" got the recognition S. Korean film (and television) deserve. When I was young, Paris was my number one city to visit. Today, it would be Seoul and Busan. This series SHOULD have great appeal to American audiences.Repeatedly and consistently S. Korean drama portrays great models of human conduct that should be emulated. I've said this before but it bears repeating. There are so many S. Korean actresses that superbly play roles of women every man should fall in love with. It's not just their physical attractiveness. The courage, sass, confidence, compassion, loyalty, determination, persistence, warmth, tenderness, wisdom, strength, impenetrable wall they manifest in their characters, often without saying a word, is what has become the essence of Korean beauty.Their male characters do the same for that archetype as well. Don't encapsulate yourself in American only film, television, literature,art. Follow Bong Joon-ho's advice. Get past the subtitles. This will open up a world brighter than your wildest dreams. And ""Descendants of the Sun"" is an excellent step into that world. You will not be disappointed. Pay attention. You. Will. Be. Blown. Away. This is THAT GOOD.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

tt4925000,"DOTS is a captivating melodrama with intense visuals, not excluding beautiful men and women. The first episode had me feeling a couple of different ways. Firstly, I've never taken to battle scenes. The first few minutes I felt confused, couldn't tell who the good guys and the bad guys were...what was the end goal? Ok now they have surrendered their weapons.. is it resolved? So many questions! However, flash forward to daily life. As soon as they stopped that young thief then proceeded to pay for his hospital bill, I knew that this was part of military propaganda in action. It portrays the soldiers as somewhat philanthropic men who will aid other young men in reforming their moral character. Secondly, *enter gorgeous doctor.* Joining the military will also get you a beautiful and smart woman who understands that you have priorities to the nation and will an important yet secondary role. Thirdly, it's epic. The ending scene shows Yoo Shi-jin jetting off in a helicopter to fight ISIS. What man wouldn't want to join a lifetime of real life video games? So, not only does it serve as domestic propaganda, but also soft power. The anti-communist sentiment influences international audiences to continue to hold hostility against certain countries, especially NK. Also, it promotes tourism to filming locations not only in Korea, but all around the world.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Drama"
tt4925000,"DOTS can serve both as propaganda and soft power because it encourages South Korea's ideals and ethics while also exhibiting soft power because it's a popular Korean genre for many viewers. We think it makes sense for the show to be these things because it allows the government to push their ideas to a global population and make the country look like it has pride in it's nation and its people. Some main points about Korea for viewers are that SK has gone through a period of growth economically and in soft power, all men must enlist in the military, this enlistment is seen as a right of passage, and it gains them respect in society. I think the audience they were targeting is pretty much Koreans of all ages, possibly more specifically the younger generation. We think this because enlistment might have growing resistance, but a movie like this sheds positive light on it, and keeps it entertaining through k-drama tropes. We didn't like the CGI because it seemed a little cheesy. Additionally, the plot exhausts tropes that are already very commonly used not only in k-dramas, but dramas in general. However, we did like the show's second lead couple because they showed more emotional development within the characters.

tt4925000,"Descendants of the Sun is a 2016 Korean drama starring Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo in which the male lead is a captain in the Korean Special Forces, and the female lead is a surgeon at a hospital in South Korea. The romance between the two leads drives the storyline, as they serve in different capacities in a war-torn country called Urk.Descendants of the Sun includes a cliche romance between two good looking lead characters who are played by some of the most popular Hallyu actors at the time. This classic formatting which has been seen throughout the history of Korean dramas keeps up with Koreans' motive to use K-dramas as a form of soft power. This drama perfectly encompasses all the elements that are familiar to domestic and international viewers, ensuring that the drama will be consumed by a large audience. Additionally, the drama was entirely pre-produced which would allow for approval in other countries such as China so that it could be aired at the same time as in Korea (aka: more viewership).By utilizing a familiar and established convention of Korean dramas-an unlikely romance between two characters who are perfect opposites-to contextualize a nationalistic story about the archetypical self-sacrificing, masculine Korean soldier, Descendants of the Sun effectively serves as an advertisement for the Korean military. In an article written by Lindsay Schaffer, she states that the propaganda is exemplified by the fact that both leads are driven to save lives; one by self sacrifice for his country to protect the citizens and the other by healing the sick and injured. By juxtaposing the life-saving efforts of medical staff with the missions of the military, the duties of a soldier are mapped onto the duties of a doctor, and thus the military is distanced from its violent or more problematic role in Korean society (Schaffer 2019, 49).",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Drama"

tt4925000,"So, here I am having watched South Korean content for 3 years and I'm only just finishing up with ""Descendants of the Sun""....It was pretty good, but not amazing.First of all, I really, really did like this series. I thought it was pretty good for a few reasons.The main reason, in fact is that, romance is not my genre. At all.
It is not something I willingly sit and watch (and truth be told, I did only watch this for Lee Jin Ki as Lee Chi Hoon). Now, normally, I'd have thrown the towel in as the romance started going, rolling my eyes, sighing heavily and coming back to this after a few months and struggled through it for the sake of completing it. For ""Descendants""? I found there was actually a lot of other sub-plots going on that allowed me to remain glued to my screen and involved. The action plots were pretty superb, the medical knowledge was pretty on point with very little mistakes, and the disaster line made me cry over three episodes more times than I can count.However, I have some qualms that really knocked the rating down for me.On the ""Descendants"" media page, we're given the tag 'strong female lead'. I'm sorry but Kang Mo Yeon hating most men until she falls in love, meanwhile being a horrendous jealous pathetic woman constantly talking behind other's backs just because they're more successful than her is not in any form a strong woman. This was exhausting and I actually cared less about her than most of the characters. Romance wise, all I cared about was the third story line - not the second leads, but Song Sang Hyeon and Ha Ja Ae. I felt I connected more to their story than I did the whole fall in love romance line going on with Yoo Shi Jin and Mo Yeon. Eye rolling and boring, if I'm totally honest.
This goes the same for Dae Yeong and Myung Ju... why are they acting like cat and mouse and they despise each other when? It made no sense, and they were all boring save for Sang Hyeon and Ja Ae.Secondly, again, the romance was just everywhere. She hates him, she wants to go on a date with him, he tells her he has a very important job, she respects he has a very important job, he goes to do his job, she gets annoyed, and breaks it off, then suddenly they're paired up again and falling for each other all over again? Come on, at least be slightly more realistic than this. As much as I loved the acting from these Song Joong Ki and Song Hye Kyo, I really didn't feel any chemistry between the characters and it drove me up the wall. I also felt Jin Goo and Kim Ji Won had no chemistry between their characters; save the one hazmat scene, I didn't feel any other feelings for them.Other than these two points? I loved the drama. I loved the rest of it, I loved the characters, I loved so much about this. It's just a shame that the two main points let me down quite a bit, but I would quite happily rewatch this in the future.

tt4925000,"I wanted to like this series but wasn't able to continue watching after just a few episodes. The female characters in this series, including Song Hye Kyo's lead character, are a disgrace. Do top female surgeons in Korea frequently get into cat fights and pull each other's hair like children at a playground? In many other countries this would be grounds for immediate dismissal from one's job. I understand cultural relativism and that Korean culture is very different from Western cultures (I live in the U.S.), but for god's sake you're a surgeon. People's lives are in your hand. Act with the dignity and self-respect of someone in such an important role! After watching this inane, brainless, frivolous behavior I lost all respect for Hye Kyo's character and switched to something else. Descendants of the Sun may be a great drama but when the one of the lead characters is such a turn-off it's hard to continue to the next episode.

Hiro Nakamura, Claire Bennet, Peter Petrelli, Niki Sanders, you named it and I can recall their fantastic moments in Heroes.Fast forward 2023, South Korean launched their own superheroes drama series. I can't help but thinking about Heroes because the vibe was so similar. The beautiful Go Youn Jung was as pretty as the cheerleader Hayden Panettiere (save the cheerleader save the world right?!). The simple hearted Kim Bong Seok just as heartwarming as Hiro Nakamura. Electric man Cha Tae Hyun was just as tragic as Peter Petrelli.One thing that differentiate Moving from Heroes was its POV. Every episode, we were treated with different vibes from different characters. One episode felt just like teenage K-Drama series, another one felt like office romance series, and the other would felt like mob movie.

I have watched many Korean, Jap, English and American series that are not based on thriller, mystery and crime genre and can still be very much engaging and binge worthy, this is one of those shows.I can easily recommend it to anyone without having second thoughts. Not being a mystery-thriller and still being able to grip us to the show is really something I appreciate about it.Screenplay, Story, Plot are top notch.If you're into Korean content it's a must watch.If you're tired of the same old superhero movies and TV shows, check out Moving on Disney+.

tt24640580,"Moving is a big-budget Disney+ original series surrounding three high school students with genetic superhuman abilities living quietly with their retired parents. But their lives turn upside down when powerful organizations start to hunt them down one by one.Moving is reportedly the most expensive Korean TV series to date and it really shows in the production. It has massive action sequences, and extensive fight scenes that get so graphic you'd think you're watching The Raid movies. The visual effects look fantastic and there's this stunning flying scene at the end of episode 7 that looks straight out of a hollywood superhero picture.But the best thing about this series and why it works so much is because of the sublime casting. From the top acclaimed cast to the young leads, there's no weak link as everyone clearly delivers and it's satisfying to see the young actors keeping up and not being outshined by their seniors.Another thing, despite the packed main characters with respective back stories, Moving's seamless shifts between the past events and present timeline keeps the mystery and anticipation active. It also truly helps that the protagonists who are taking us through the story are endearing and charismatic. And although this centers around people with super powers, it still feels very much grounded and the in-depth relationship between the characters is still the main aspect of the story.Moving brilliantly blends action, drama, romance, humor, and creates this high-class and exhilarating superhero drama full of heart that we rarely see in Asian TV. Let's support quality content and stream Moving available worldwide on Hulu and Disney+.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The story about the childrens of intelligent agency who have superpowers like their parents. The story is so good and each of the characters played their role so well. There is so much emotional connection you will get with the main character. The best thing about the series is that you will get the real emotions of a person who has superhuman abilities but they are like all others with so much vulnerability. Just completed seven episode and they nailed it. Waiting for whole season now and I hope they renew for next one also.,positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"There are many things to love about this series! A stellar, ensemble cast; impressive production value; and an intriguing storyline with doses of action, adventure, mystery, coming-of-age, and rom-com--this is a bold entry by Disney into K-Dramas.I felt the series was strongest when focusing on characters and their development. There were excellent use of flashbacks and clever editing showing different viewpoints. The family relationships added depth and relatability. It was possibly weakest with some of the plot development--the English dialogue and interactions between government agencies did not feel compelling or sufficiently fleshed out. But I am fully satisfied with this being character- and action-driven.The series commits much to building the Moving universe and characters. It seems the producers and the writer (who also created the eponymous webtoon) might be interested in sequels and spinoffs using the stellar cast.I am happy to see another big player like Disney entering the K-Drama arena. Given the company's recent financial struggles, I sure hope this turns out to be a great success and leads to further projects for us to enjoy!!",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Full of supernatural twists! Han Hyo Joo always brings justice to all her characters. She really played a very good mother here. The way she raises her son is really amazing. Chemistry between Bong Seok and Hui Soo is pretty cute. Only 7 episodes are released. I know I am gonna have a lot of action scenes! More understanding would be shown among the supernatural workers I guess. I hope Gang Hoon gets along with his two classmates BS and HS. Bang Kisoo is giving me headache.

Bongseok is so cute and his scene with han hyo joo in ep 7 is the best, mother and son argument. You can feel their emotions.

I know my opinion won't be popular here but there we go.I did like the actors - in fact, I know most of them from other Korean dramas and they're great.The beginning of the series was nice, although I found myself trapped in a typical high school drama with the typical rampant bullying from thousands of other Korean stories, typical loves me / loves me me not, and so on.Then the story, with no warning, abandons the three kids and goes into a multi-hour flashback telling full, increasingly gory back stories of every parent and then some.In the end, it cuts to present and plunges us into a convoluted, overly long, 3-hour ""final fight"" where the same people endlessly revive. I was literally skipping ahead, saying ""not another fight between these two, they've fought at least twice already!""And then the stereotypes...Lying, treacherous Americans?

tt24640580,"This is certainly an ambitious show. Anytime you're dealing with any type of super human abilities, you are going to draw comparisons to Marvel series and other successful predecessors. This show definitely has elements of the Incredibles and X-Men series. The camaraderie among the high school students also gives the audience a bit of Harry Potter vibe. All of these elements combined sets up what appears to be a very enjoyable show. The cast is filled with many proven veteran actors and actresses and their performances certainly do not disappoint. For those who are not familiar with Korean actors and actresses, the show did manage to assemble a team of ""Avengers"" level performers. I have watched up to Ep. 8 now and I'm somewhat eager to complete the 20 episodes as they become available. I think this could certainly be an entertaining show for many. Perhaps many more seasons may follow.However, I do want to warn anyone who has not seen the show about some of the problems they may have to deal with. The biggest problem for me was the inclusion of so many unnecessary scenes that make the show almost unbearable at times. There are too many gymnasium scenes, too many ""vending machine"" scenes, too much information about ""Bungaeman"" that really did not add any value to the show (I have a feeling there's more of this as future episodes give background info on other pivotal characters in the show). The show is based on an existing webtoon. Perhaps the slow pace works well for a format like webtoon. However, the slow character development simply does not work very well for the video format. Perhaps the commitment to create a 20-episode series is the reason or perhaps being too faithful to the source material is the problem. Whatever the case, the show will test the limits of your patience at times. This show could easily have been 9/10 or even better.",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"I think I realised it didn't know what it was doing after it came back from the flashbacks. Those last few episodes were truly horrid imo**** Finale spoilers ***The 'villain' characters' highly aimless plan to wander around the school searching for stuff, ppl doing stuff for no reason, and other things. A group of superpower ppl meeting up, fighting and then going home/dying was the purpose of the end episodes with not much else. The North's whole approach to everything was 'let's randomly do this and see what happens'. Rather than being a cool display of power, some of those fight scenes were super cringe. I really don't get what that NIS security guard's job was. I laughed when he emerged from nowhere at the end. Never did find out why Delinquent Dude was roaming around the school and his presence, plus that of Camera girl, added nothing to the story. I'd have liked to see just 1 conversation between the bus driver and his company explaining why he still has a job after totalling his bus yet again 😒 He also must have a superpower related to spotting ppl going about their business. The end felt like it was thrown together. For side characters, the number of times they mentioned they had a great purpose or story before dying, it started feeling like a metaphor for the show. That, and floaty boy's power. Just no substance. We even find out floaty boy grew up without a dad for vaguely ridiculous reasons.It had something earlier in the season and I appreciated the character development. And then, lazy writing.

I appreciate the relatable characters that allow you to enter their shoes emotion wise, especially the mother son disagreement in ep7.

At first I enjoyed the flashback scenes because I thought they would last maybe an episode. But instead lasted four boring hours. Then once back to the present the flashbacks continued for what felt like every 10 minutes. The flashback were mainly pointless drivel that tried to give the bad guys a sad back story.

Also it can be hard to understand the plot at times and how certain things are connected to each other. They show many of the characters as passive beings in their own lives not doing anything about their own circumstances. Some good action scenes but dialogue and plot of the show could be a lot better the fact that it's about them having super human abilities is not enough to grip me I think they should have worked more on the premise of the show before bringing it up the screen.Quick summary: some good action scenes but tired dialogue and slow pace

tt24640580,"--- up to 20th
Besides the slugfest, the last few episodes reaffirms the main theme of acceptance and the longing of being normal, even for the mutants from the North. And consolidates the evil of government, bureaucrats and power hungry people. I liked that everyone was involved, including the solider turned teacher, the 2 or 'normal' students and obviously the electric bus driver. Also nice touch and humor on the big brute from the North.---- ep 13
The other theme, so far, is acceptance. Just like the X-men counterpart. That is shown in two episodes on Monster. The clincher is in the recipricated dialogue when each ask of the others past and they both accepted, without hesitation by saying 'you must have your reasons'.A side on the production. Some FX here are not that up to par. But to me, that's secondary to the story. As long as the 4main catch : story, direction, acting, writing, are still on a relatively high level.What I've missed so far is the theme of parenting. Ever since the first episode, that has been there all along. And this theme culminated in two scenes. 1) the flashback of the why flying man/super sensory couple had to hide and the diversion getaway to save the child. 2) the Monster and the other super parent saving the 3rd child in the sewers. And what Monster decide to do when the evil director found the special powers are passed on to the next generation. This series is not about super heroes.---- ep 8
This is a continuous review. I'm only 8 episodes in and the show is taking its time and I have no problem with that. Some people will not have the patience to find this gem.This to me is a Korean version of the X-men. But much more down to earth. The main point of the story, I think, is these 'mutant' are most of the time, normal people. You can see this in the throw back of the love story between the couple. You can see in the students that wants to fit in so badly. Case in point is the repression and outburst of each of the 3 high school students. One had to restraint herself to do what is right, ended up in a bloody one on 17 brawl. Another can not save his 'girl' because he can not be free to practice flying.These are just normal people, deep down inside.They want to work, contribute, pass the tests at school, make friends, live a life, find love.How they came to be is just as important as who they are and what they want to become.The story has a lot of characters and each is carefully devoted with their own story.

The main problem is it hasn't got a clear plot, just a bunch of individuals with super powers wondering and interacting with others, there wasnt even a main story line, that makes it rather slow paced and uninteresting. The story was mainly broken into 3 stories that were loosely connected, there wasnt a clear main character or antagonist or plot to carry through. The cast were fine but they were wasted as the characters were lack of charisma or strong personnel that shines, but rather portraits as dull ordinary individuals. When a drama or movie is written it should carry a main story or convey a certain message which Moving has totally failed to deliver, which is giant waste of talents and viewers time. Hiring fake reviewers to up rate the drama doesnt save moving from its boredom, it's way better to save time for a nap.",negative,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

tt24640580,"Moving is an electrifying Korean drama that takes a bold leap into the ever-popular superhero genre, reminiscent of American series like Heroes. While it's undeniable that this series treads on familiar territory, it does so with an exhilarating, commendable twist that delivers a captivating and thrilling viewing experience.In recent years, Korean entertainment has embarked on a fascinating journey of adapting and reimagining successful series and movies from around the world, with a particular focus on American productions. This one is a shining example of this trend.What sets Moving apart is its ability to infuse its unique Korean essence into this well-established formula.The visual effects in this series deserve special acclaim.

Those well-versed in American superhero series may recognize certain thematic elements and character dynamics that seem reminiscent of what's been explored before. However, it's essential to note that this drama doesn't merely replicate these elements; it reimagines them with a fresh perspective, breathing new life into the genre.Turning our attention to the cast, there is little to say except praise for the stellar performances delivered by the ensemble.

Their ability to convey a wide range of emotions and infuse depth into their characters is a testament to their talent and dedication.Equally impressive are the younger actors, with Lee Jung Ha standing out as a remarkable talent. At only 25 years old, he showcases an astonishing range of emotions through his character, leaving an indelible mark on the series. His ability to connect with viewers and convey the complexities of his role is a testament to his promising future in the industry.In conclusion, Moving is a shining example of Korea's ability to adapt and reimagine established genres.

tt24640580,"When I first watched this Kdrama, I searched up about it like I do with every other show that interests me a lot. They were not lying when they said this was a whole new genre for K-drama. I have never watched a K-drama like this and have enjoyed it this much. Although this is not finished, I hope Moving wins a award. Not to mention this is also star studded. Every time I finish a episode it leaves me completely empty and left to wonder and just stare at my screen for a few minutes. I really have never watched a K-drama like this before. This has to be one of my top 5 or even top 3 K-drama. I have recommended Moving to all my friends to watch it and all of them have had good reviews. I have left this review to show support for this K-drama hoping that it will have enough fanbase to continue for a season 2. The romance being portrayed in Moving also feels realistic and not rushed or cliche like a normal K-drama. This makes me love the show even more because it doesn't rush the teenage characters to like each other. The K-drama only shows hints that there could possibly be a relationship in the future. The potential/present relationship of King Bo Seok and Huisoo is so wholesome, sweet and caring. It not only shows that they are very good friends but it also shows hints of romance. It felt very realistic to me. Every K-drama i've watched I always thought to myself that it was very cliche and it would be a very slim chance scenarios like that happen in real life. While those type of K-dramas are also relatable, I feel that I have connected more to Moving.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I am not a fan of comics or superhero genres, nor I am enjoying subtitles, but I got drawn in because these do not feel like high level sketches and almost got a real life feel to them.

Bravo to amazing veteran actors Ryu Seung Ryong (JooWon), Han Hyo Jojo (Mi Hyun), and one of my favs, super-sexy Zo In Sung (Doo Shik) in his most unsexy and boring character to date. I wish he had more screen time...what a waste of a comeback for this talented actor!

tt24640580,"A Korean action drama following three students attending the same high school all hiding some form of super power, as they discover their past, their powers, and get a glimpse of their future. At first passing this over as yet another gritty realistic show about superpowers, a few early recommendations / reviews caught my eye so I decided to give it a go, and wow it did not disappoint. Hitting the ground running, we're thrust into a considerably fun action series, with quality practical fight scenes, good choreography, and a strong narrative. The CGI at points leaves a bit to be desired and as a k-drama the series is considerably slower paced, stretching out to 20 episodes in its first season so far, however generally the length isn't too noticeable and feels justified. As a drama, I definitely teared up more than once, it loves to pull heartstrings as much as show cool action, and will also warn there is considerable violence, as it can be that kind of show. Fairly expected in its overall plot, it had enough nuance to keep me compelled, and the stories of each individual character and their past definitely drew me into the world, although some parts were certainly a bit more boring or silly than others. All in all a fantastic time, and highly looking forward to where they take things in the next season, I would recommend this show, especially if it sounds your sort of thing.",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I kept waiting for ""something"" up until episode 6 and that is when it started going into the parents' backstory which had no relevant to the progress of the main story.

That was also my initial belief but then about a third of the way through the series, the show pivots to the backstory of the parents which is much more interesting and gives a greater depth and emotional development to the characters.

They also feel artificial going after the history of each character one by one.The real problem is the last 6 episodes. Lots of flashbacks but also the most cliche superhero fights ever written. Punching in turns? Check. Stopping before the other guy is about to die? Check. The other guys recovers fully and comes back to the fight? Check. Long talks from the killer to explain themselves?

tt24640580,"My roommate and I routinely have a show or drama to watch as a source of motivation to finish our school work. On September 10th, we finished watching ""See You in My 19th Life"", a new Korean drama on Netflix. It was a show that my roommate already watched over the summer, but it was so good that she suggested we watch it together. The unique plot about past lives made me reflect on the idea of reincarnation, sparking an idea for one of my class projects. To find a new show or drama, I checked what's trending on Instagram and found ""Moving"" and ""My Lovely Liar."" They are both Korean dramas that have been recently released. To decide which drama to watch, we looked up both trailers. The former seemed to be more action-heavy, accompanied by advanced CGI, while the latter was filled with romance and humor. Our indecisive personalities were not succumbed. Finally, we checked which is available on the platforms we have access to, which is something we should have done first. My roommate, having access to Hulu, made the final decision to watch ""Moving."" Starting the first episode on her iPad, both with snacks in our hands, we filled the dorm room with screams and laughter. That night, unable to withstand the cliffhangers, we watched until the third episode.

There is no main character and character so plain and dull that I can't bother what happen to them. Everytime that's a tension moment but stop half way or u already know what's going to happen next.

tt24640580,"Moving is one of the most moving action/spy/superpower stories I have ever watched. At its core is love and family, something that's conveyed through every interaction between parent and child. It, of course, became my new favorite k-drama, because for 15 episodes, out of 20, this show touched me in ways no other show have.My Rating: 9.5/10
My issue with most shows/movies that deal with superpowers is the stakes. Such shows demand us to be on the edge about the safety of the lead characters that we (should) care about. However, usually, they set up the story in such a way that the viewers are already comfortable and know that the leads are safe no matter what. They make the leads so overpowered/smart against the villains that it's obvious that the leads are going to be safe. This is where Moving excels so much. The way the story is framed, makes you feel that a confrontation with the villains is a matter of life and death. The protagonists aren't overpowered in front of the villains so the stakes feel real and scary. It has been able to evoke genuine fear in my heart about the well-being of the characters.Another element is that superhero stuff nowadays relies so much on the star power of the actor or the existing fandom of the leads that they pay little to no attention to building the character of these superhumans. So it always feels hollow. I'm like- okay I am supposed to care about this person but eh I don't see why I should care. This is where Moving comes in and breaks the mold. The show has painted such elaborate pictures of the lives of all these characters that it is impossible to not care about them. Literally every single significant character is given flashbacks to develop their character so well. This helps in building the stakes of the story as well.We feel empathy for ones we've only just met, who are also fighting to protect their families and who are also being used by those with political power. The battle, the outcome, the final scenes conveyed a much bigger message. Where the death of innocent people is considered a ""necessary sacrifice,"" and children are being manipulated into becoming weapons to be used for the ""benefit"" of the state, there is evil. Ultimately (after much violence and many bad deeds) this is a story about two groups of superpowered people who have been positioned against each other but come to recognize who the real enemy is. Some of these characters are far more bad than they are good, but the story ends with a commitment to protecting the next generation and ensuring history doesn't repeat itself.The cast was absolutely perfect in conveying every emotion the webtoon and the writers wanted to convey, every single performance gets a 10/10 from me. The OSTs were also very memorable and helps elevate the emotions of the scenes it was put in, and yes I already have the OSTs saved in a playlist to listen to and reminisce from time to time. The CGI is not perfect, there were a lot of dodgy scenes where the characters looked like video game characters bouncing around, but it never happened to their faces, and it never looked unnatural, it was good CG. Spectacular fight scenes and stunt work, great use of the abilities portrayed here, although I do wish the abilities were a little more diverse, rather than 4 or 5 characters just having the exact same powers.Spoilers Ahead, so please stop reading if you haven't watched the show. Now, onto my problems with the show. My main complaint is Kisoo's character, and how insignificant he felt. The show would've worked perfectly fine without him. He was just...there. But he did gave some powerful scenes with the teacher around episodes 17 and 18, but then again, that could've been achieved with just Ganghoon. It bothered me because of how in episodes 15 and 16, they made it look like he was some important character, but never went deeper into that. My other issue is when Doosik finally reunited with his family and we barely got to see 5 seconds of it, like it would've been perfect to end the episode with the surplus of emotions if they prolonged that scene of reunion, but it just cut to black, and I guess we'll see in Season 2.As was foreshadowed during that much earlier conversation between Huisoo's parents, we got a happy ending. I'm grateful that the main plot points were tied up; to have ended with a cliffhanger, and no promise of future episodes, would have been cruel. The final episode has definitely set things up for another season, and I really hope we get it. If only to give us a reunion scene between Bongseok and Huisoo. Their last on screen interaction was during a really high stakes situation in which everyone was in mortal danger, and I'm sad we didn't see them meet following that. However, I suppose the bullet still lodged in the arm and the yellow raincoat speak volumes... we know everything we need to know.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"Moving is basically like the show Heroes back in 2006, but produced as a K-drama with some romance and action combined. What surprised me is that each episode does a great job developing each character, like Bong-Seok trying to hide his emotions until his secret powers were exposed to Hee-soo.While the high school romance drama part is something that can make some sort of Disney+ show about teenage superheroes, the other mysterious part of an assassin hunting down other people with powers is the real kicker. Im already 5 episodes in and I'm roped into the whole plot.The thing is, this show just does a good job with pacing. It doesn't feel like a drag, 40 minute episodes, none of those minutes were wasted trying to show the landscape or whatnot, and good character development. And it's a much more needed superhero show that stirs away from the usual ""hero saves the world"" type of thing we've seen from Marvel in the past few years. A show about past heroes (and new ones) being hunted down by some unknown assailant is refreshing.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The action is amazing. It takes a few episodes to really punch you in the gut but when it does you will be glued to your seat. Do not miss this show. Korean dramas have really made their mark and I love that they truly tackle issues without being so politically correct like most American TV shows these days. I hope they make many more like this. I am super jealous of anyone that will be just starting this show.,positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The CGI is good as well, considering that its a disney series, its kinda expected. (Spoiler) The series was just at the right pace up until the graduation, as soon as they pulled the execution of the general of nokor and the escape of dongsik it all became rushed. Considering that they've set up the ending for a potential season 2, they have just wasted so much arcs that they couldve used later. They couldve expressed those arcs more thoroughly,dramatically and exciting, I really do not see the point why did they squeeze all of that at the ending of season 1, its so unecessary.",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Exceptionally, neither happened and I eagerly followed each episode to the next with a mix of happiness, excitement and anticipation.

The superpower scenes and combat are superb, the CGI scenes are noticeable but nothing unforgivable, in fact they did great. One small """"""bad"""""" thing: they spent so much time developing the parents that it felt the kids were side characters.

Even the North Koreans weren't just depicted as machines following their commanders, I respect that depiction.Good show.

After seeing this drama, One thing I can say , This is how you tell the storyline, This is how you do the characters development, This is how you make some thing entertaining, this is how you can set a best background score. I could have given 10 star, but i cut one from the whole score becauae there are too much back story for each character,I think that was unnecessary for few of them. Any way I saw whole tv series in 2 days, It was awesome and mind blowing. All content either Action sequences ,thriller, suspence or love story are awesome.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"Original take on the superhero genre, fully rooted in the real world (albeit, with superpowers!). The series asks what would superpower 'gifted' humans live like, and provides compelling case that they would be used (and abused) by state powers, intelligence services, and not for the typical 'save the world for alien apocalypse' scenarios posited by the Marvel and DCEU universes (think ""Heroes"" TV series). Instead, they present a world where the 'gifted' ones are set are misunderstood, marginalized and ultimately have to choose to be exploited by these institutions, or to disappear. The characters discover their powers realistically, with stops and starts with the mastery of the powers. They are also very well developed as characters, and the action set pieces both exciting and extremely well executed. Each episode is about 45 minutes, and moves the overall story along with good pace.I loved the series and the end credits opens up possibilities for continuing this compelling series. Excellent!",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"This is without a doubt the absolute best super hero (if you can call it that) series I've ever seen. All the actors were amazing. Storryn was watertight from start to finish. Everything felt real... like it was actually happening in our real world. Which made it feel all the more real.Again... What incredible actors. In addition... Whoever has taken care of everything, seen to how they should stand, act, express themselves, is a genius.We, me and my wife sat at home on the sofa in Stockholm and wished that the series would not end.

tt24640580,"I have always been a fan of superpower/superhero movies. But this one exceeds my expectations, especially since it's k-drama. Don't get me wrong I have loved k-drama since I was a kid but this type of genre is rarely good in k-drama.THIS SHOW IS EVEN BETTER THAN SOME SUPERHERO MOVIE OUT THERE.It's good because it's realistic if there is a superhuman in this world. They portray it so humanely. And I like how the teenage character looks and behaves like a teenager. The romance is really wholesome and doesn't feel forced (kudos to the actors/actresses). I also like how every episode shows every character's background, it makes the audience not feel biased. Some might feel it makes the story slow, but NO it's a series, so yeah it needs to take time like this to understand every character's POV. This show definitely needs a second season, it would be so much cool if they make this series its own universe.And the fact that the webtoon is somehow different makes it more great cause we don't know how it will go in the future.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I had no clue it was based on a comic book series - might be because I wasn't really into KDramas before this. But wow, this show opened my eyes to what I've been missing!""Moving"" stands out as one of the premier superhero dramas of 2023. Each main character is intricately developed, with a compelling backstory that fosters a deep emotional connection with the audience. What's really cool about this show is how it makes superheroes feel like everyday people - they've got their vulnerabilities and are just trying to fit into the world.He action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with some scenes so expertly choreographed they'll leave you with goosebumps. It ranks alongside the very best in the Superhero genre. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. ""Moving"" is truly a must-watch experience.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"Having solid character development is a crucial aspect of every good movie or TV show. Without it, one is left with something superficial and meaningless. Unfortunately, ""Moving"" took this way too far.What should have been a taught, exciting series was boring and tedious with long drawn-out ""back story"" episodes and arcs for almost every character (sometimes even minor characters that showed up out of nowhere in the final episodes). This resulted in a show severely lacking in focus and with very little sense of forward motion (which is ironic for a show called ""Moving""). It could have been cut by 40% and would have been a much better show as a result.As much as I wanted to like this, and I respect and appreciate what the creators tried to achieve with it, it was a real chore to make it to the final episode. Honestly, I'm surprised by the high ratings, and consider this a disappointing missed opportunity.",negative,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"'Save the Cheerleader, Save the World' was my teenage slogan of a Superhero series that intrigued, glued and floored me. It felt so good to be in love with a bad guy named 'Silas' while rooting for the heroes to save the day. Hiro Nakamura was the first to open my eyes to a pandora of amazing Asian content that I feigned ignorance of till then. That was 2006.2023 Just woke my sleeping emotions for another superhero series that just swept me off my feet. This time a Korean series but language hasn't been a barrier for great content.Moving did just that. It moved me harder and faster towards another superhero series that gave me a 'Hero' series vibe. Except, this series is BIGGER, BETTER!!! I couldn't rave enough about it. I have watched the whole series at least 8 times over. Recommended it to every soul I know, and still haven't raved enough, therefore this review :)First, In terms of the cast: stellar, brilliant and unexpectedly expected. I won't lie, initially, I did watch it for Zo Insung (Kim Doosik/ Moon San) but you stay hooked because of Kim Bongseok, Guryungpo, Lee Kanghoon, Lee Jae - Man and Jang Huisoo. Every cast member made a lasting impression and their character arcs are so well fleshed out and depicted, that it'd be hard to pick an immediate favourite of the lot.Second, the storytelling is just fantastic. The non-linear format of storytelling has you hooked from the get-go. I would say, that paying attention to a lot of the easter eggs and finer details makes for rewatch value.Third, the CGI is brilliant and human. It's rare to describe CGI as human, but the superhuman abilities and effects are so subtle and seamless that it's brilliant. The VFX team and cinematography departments did build a synergy of creative effects. Shout out to the graphic teams as well for the excellent movie posters and trailers that just built on the intrigue and allure of this show.Overall this show had the capacity and mass appeal of a Marvel cinematic movie, the romance of Korean dramas and the comedic timing and mob madness of Asian cinema. It has a mix of everything - Just. Pure. Entertainment.Can't wait for season 2!",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"I have my good things to say about this drama. Good plot, good character portrayal, good acting by everyone, and the deeper meaning that the writer wants to deliver.I just would like the pace to be faster, like the story introducing the background and history of every character take 2 episodes, which IMO is too long and too slow, many times the same thing is repeated again and again but its not necessary indeed. I think audience nowadays prefer fast paced / shorter dramas, and Moving could also benefit from cutting short to 16 episodes.Seems like there'll be a season 2? Some things are not explained at the end, e.g. Why the school girl appeared before the NIS director and reprimanded him? Who killed the school principal? I would love to see season 2!",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"To all my fellow cautious viewers and decision makers looking for the Parents' Guide, here's a helpful review. This has recently been rated TV-MA, and in my opinion is also rated R mostly based on violence. Fight scenes so far (episodes 1-7) could shock and frighten viewers as most of them get extremely gory. As the show progresses, scenes may only get more severe. Let it be known the show is not ALL fight scenes. The only other warning is that the content is sprinkled with some cussing. Even with all the violence, I believe this is a fantastic show. Just be warned if you are a sensitive viewer or plan on watching with sensitive viewers.",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

tt24640580,"Moving, a South Korean drama about superpowered teens and the superpowered parents trying to protect them, became Disney's most-watched K-drama of all time. For the past few years, Korean dramas have extensively diversified their genres and viewership, moving beyond the tag of romantic comedies to producing some of the best thrillers, zombie or otherwise! Moreover, they have ventured into genres like dystopia, science-fiction, and now, superheroes! Needless to mention, Moving brings a fresh new entry to K-Drama with its superhero storyline with some family drama.The show is extremely engaging with the pacing, storyline, action sequences, themes, and the performance of the cast and character relations. Moving is a great concoction of fantasy, mystery, thriller, action, and of course, a romcom, the characteristic feature of Kdramas. Moreover, it features the themes of bullying but now from the perspective of the silent observer and ethical questions that accompany the cost of a lost childhood when children are sold into becoming weapons of the state or in a simpler sense, sold into labor.In a nutshell, Moving is, hands down, one of the most engaging and unique Kdramas released in 2023 and it would be a shame not to give it a chance with its interesting story, pacing, interesting characters, and the numerous mysteries unveiling themselves.My Rating: 9.5/10.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

tt24640580,"I'm so glad I was recommended this because I really enjoyed it. Honestly I wasn't expecting much because South Korea isn't known for its superhero shows and movies. However the plot for Moving is solid, so is the writing for its characters and the special effects are good too. The internal and foreign conflicts that are the basis for Moving's plot are well written and well paced, and there is more to explore with how episode 20 ended.I also liked that this show was just as much about the children as it is about the adults. Viewers got to learn about their past and how everything led to the current time. Not only that, there's an emphasis on familial ties and how strongly one is influenced by them, and I think the writers did a great job on it. I was pleasantly surprised by the characterisation of the North Korean characters. I think the North Korean army tends to be portrayed as a group of unfeeling robots but the ones in Moving were portrayed as normal people with their own beliefs and feelings.The ending where Jang Juwon and the North Korean with his same abilities were working together at his fried chicken shop made me happy to be honest. And that scene where the North Korean who could fly like Kim Doosik, killed his own general and decided to release KDS also made me cheer out loud. So yes, I liked the ending and I'll be looking forward to S2.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"I'd like to preface this review by saying I like Korean Dramas. Sure, they are simplistic and unsophisticated, but the have heart, good acting and hark back to a more innocent time. They are pure and innocent escapist fun. This series is a step too far. The plot is hopelessly and poorly derivative. The writing is embarrassingly child like. The actors do the best with what they're given, except Lee jeong ha who acts like a mix between Forrest Gump and my name is Sam. The weird gurning and smiling into distance, combined with the cutesy run is irritating. All in all a big fail. The plot fails to excite interest and largely goes nowhere. No idea how this is rated so highly.",negative,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"This is how an adaptation should be. The TV series 'Moving' heightens what a video can do. Webtoon has a rich and dense story, and action scenes are adequately portrayed, but there is a limit to what a paper can do. However, 'Moving' takes a chance and unleashes the creativity that it used to hold in the boundary on the paper.When any kind of literature, play, or even cartoon is adapted, fans of original work want it to stay strictly to the source while it has the responsibility to attract a wider audience who are not familiar with the work. 'Moving' succeeds in balancing the needs of two sides. Writers do a great job of taking out the unnecessary and focusing on the rest. MOREOVER, they bring out new characters and modern storylines, and it goes deep to introduce those new characters and stories as well. Just brilliant, neat, and efficient writing. I love how each chunk of episodes is divided into present, past, and fight rather than moving back and forth between the timelines. (There are some reminiscing scenes here and there, just the right amount of not distracting the main narrative.)I especially love that I feel as if I would actually bump into those heroes on the street. No fancy facilities, fancy suits, fancy penthouse nor fancy cars. Heroes should be judged for what they have inside, and 'Moving' reminds all of us what a true hero looked like from the start and what we truly love about a hero.",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"I put off watching this because I'm getting sick of superheroes and I didn't want to rewatch heroes, which I've heard this series being likened to. I decided to give it a try and I LOVED it! Here's why.First, it's much more grounded. Most of the main cast have some sort of power but they're written as characters first who just happen to have powers. Also they just want to live their lives. The kids are at school doing school stuff and the adults are trying to get by. As the series progresses you learn about the adult's past, and that comes crashing into the modern day storyline.Second, the relationships between the characters are given time to develop and breathe. The interactions between the two young main leads are charming and authentic.Finally, the genres shift as we see the backgrounds of each character. One minute it's a school romance kdrama, next it's a mob movie, spy series, comedy, serious. The tone changes but not jarringly.I highly recommend this series. The first time the series takes you away from the present day setting you might find it frustrating because you want to get back to the characters you thought the series was about, but just stick with it because everything comes together nicely.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tt24640580,"In a time when we are suffering from a over-saturation of content and less than mediocre stories, particularly related to people with superpowers, South Korea has released MOVING and proved there's still hope for the genre.Like its tittle the story is in constant move, not only pushing forward but going back to different timelines to give us context o our main characters and how the things happening in present time are a direct consequence to the past. Technically, MOVING is perfect. One of the strongest points is definitely the editing and this can be seen in the way the story jumps from one year to another but you never lose track of what's happening nor leaves you confused. There are gaps to fill but with other episodes that will give you answers. The score complements the actions and emotions of the characters to perfection.The performances are top notch and it's not surprise considering this drama is stack. If you have been watching korean dramas or films for a while, you will recognize even the most random character or one-episode-cameo it's performed by an award winning actor or actress. These people have a reputation for a reason and they deliver in every scene, with a look, a touch, a smile or a punch that will push you through a wall. For some characters in the drama literally speaking.Zo In Sung hasn't starred in a drama since Dear My Friends (2016) and I am so glad this is his return to the tv format. In MOVING he delivered a nuance, charming and badass performance that in the hands of another would have fell flat. His character's entire existence it's what pushes most of the story forward: a person used as a weapon to kill but all he ever wanted was to live. The big mystery of the drama it's to find out what was his fate after he got separated from those he loves.Ryoo Seung Ryong remains one of the most compelling actors of his generation, giving us the incredible story of a good man lost in life until he found his purpose and redemption. His storyline, full of gore and violence, was actually a tender love story about how far a man will go to protect his family. Marvelous.Han Hyo Joo's character could have easily fallen into the Smurfette principle but no. She's an equal to the men who love her and those that want to kill her, with a very strong motivation to keep herself on the top of the game. This character's loneliness comes through every scene she's in, bottling everything up in order to be strong for her family but you can tell she's waiting for a chance to be free and, most importantly, for her son to be able to live freely.Ko Yoon Jung, Lee Jeong Ha and Kim Do Hoon are really promising actors, particularly considering they hold their own while performance with so many household names. I think Kim Do Hoon and Kim Sun Kyun probably gave one of the most heartbreaking yet beautiful stories in the drama.Like I mentioned before every single actor in this drama brought their A+ game face but I would be doing a disservice if I didn't mention Kim Hee Won, Cha Tae Hyun, Ryoo Seung Bum, Park Hee Soon, Yang Dong Geun, Jo Bok Rae, Park Kwang Jae, Kim Joong He and, of course, Kwak Sun Young. She in particular was SPECTACULAR.None of these characters are one-dimensional, they are not defined by the label society wants to put on them. They are all joined together by the experiences, hardships, love, motivations and ambitions they share. At the end of the day, related or not by blood, they are a family. Even the so-called enemies.MOVING it's absolutely worthy of the hype that surrounds it through all social media and news outlets putting in the category of one of 2023 best tv shows. I only regret I didn't have the time to watch it sooner so I could have add it to mine.",positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It has magic powers spying; NK and Korea it has a love story it has a tale about right and wrong integrity the silliness of states the silliness of blinkered security agencies and it is done in such an elegant sophisticated style that now we have to say it is not just the West which comes up with great works of fiction and suspense .... this is as good as the best of the West and in a way it is better for a Western viewer as it is entirely fresh and different in every wayI do not understand a single word of Korean and yet it feels so comfortable and familiar ... so this is indubitably the good side of globalized culture ....It cannot be recommended enough as a series. I have seen a lot in 2023 but this one probably wins for me. I had seen Gongjak (2018) and was bowled over by the quality of that film this is of the exact same calibre.Also saw 6ixtynin9: The Series (2023) again a totally original piece from Thailand this time so in 2024 I am going to keep my eyes peeled on the East for clever quality series/filmsThank you to the makers of this and the gifted actors.,positive,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The plot, characters, actors and villains are so good. Every actor fits their characters perfectly and their acting was legendary. The relationship between the children and their parents was perfect. And what makes Moving better than other shows is that they honestly show us who the real villain is.

This superhero ""action, adventure, fantasy"" show is quite slow starting with a heavy amount of drama, but quickens later with more action and power and whatnot. But unlike shows like Heroes, where you want characters to die because they are so boring, in Moving, you end up caring for basically every character they want you to. The drama is very well done. Be prepared to cry a lot. The music was also well done, catchy and moving, and sticks with you.Character development is stellar, there are lots of flashbacks, so you really see massive character change through long stretches, its all well done in my opinion. Ive read many reviews of people complaining about them being so constant, but I found the context formed by them to by very worthwhile as it adds so much more weight to things.The show isnt perfect, it felt like there was some confusion in plot and antagonist focus. Which I wont spoil for this review. I am not sure how much replay value it will have, I dont think I can mine it endlessly for philosophical or religious value, but still overall its a good treasure and can leave you with things to think about.In a age of hollywood superhero garbage saturation, this was very enjoyable.",neutral,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

You can feel Bongseok's cuteness when he falls in love, Jang Juwon's heart-wrenching story, anger, and the very difficult struggle of their parents. When superhumans fight, the action is very WOW, tense and full of blood. Best action scene in k-drama so far.

tt26450613,"As this Korean drama opens a sniper is trying to kill Jeong Ji-an, a young woman in a remote house; she finds a rifle under a sofa and fires back. We then, via a series of flashbacks see how she came to be there and why she is being targeted. It turns out that her parents had been killed and she when she was a young girl and she was adopted her uncle, Jeong Jin-man. Officially he runs a business selling tubing but in reality it is a front for an illegal weapons 'supermarket'; following his apparent suicide she has inherited the business... which came as a surprise to her.I really enjoyed this action packed series. The opening scene immediately grabbed my attention before flashbacks start telling us how the situation occurred. Throughout the series we move between various time periods but is never confusing about when what we are seeing is going on. This means that even though Jeong Jin-man is dead when the series starts he is still a major character. The acting is solid throughout; the main bad guy may be a bit of a pantomime villain but that suits the feel of the series. The final episode wraps things up nicely without shutting down the possibility of another season. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to action fans.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

And can I just say that the female Assassin Minhye puts in work! I want her on my team! The Fragmented storyline keeps you guessing and wanting more. I know this is a Kdrama but I think it was targeted towards western audiences. However the promotion team needs to be fired because I only just heard about this show through sheer happenstance.

This show has it... intense action,great character development, emotions and no romance! I love it! I hope many folks are watching it... I get a lot of entertainment out of every single episode! I hope they make a season two! So far I'm chopping at the bit hoping they will make a season 2.Sooooooo if you're looking for a good action packed quality series! This is it! Look no further!

tt26450613,"I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of ""A Shop For Killers."" It's got this quick and exciting pace, with a compelling storyline and stylish cinematography, making it a show that keeps you hooked throughout.I really appreciate is the relationship between the uncle and the niece. It adds this special dynamic to the show that goes beyond just the main plot. The chemistry between them is interesting + unique and gives the storyline an extra layer of depth.As the story unfolds, I'm particularly intrigued by the potential exploration of Jeong Jinman's perspective in the upcoming episodes. It seems like there's a lot more to his character, and I'm looking forward to seeing how that unfolds. Jinman's character is quite complex and mysterious, which adds a rich dimension to the plot.While all the actors are well-cast, the performances that truly stand out are those of the actors playing Jeong Jinman and little Jian.Considering the well-rounded cast and the thoughtful plot, I have a feeling that ""A Shop For Killers"" could be one of the standout thriller series of 2024. It's got all the elements to make it unique and compelling, and I can't wait to see where the story takes us.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The fight scenes are also fun to watch. The acting is top notch, especially from Lee Dong Wook who always has an amazing presence on screen. Love him! I like that even if this is mostly an action packed show, we are slowly discovering more about the main characters and what motivates them. This show is not for everyone. They're are very violent and somewhat graphic scenes but if you like these kind of shows this is a definite must watch. Love this show!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt26450613,"I just finished watching the show, and in general I liked it a lot. The story was good, the acting was good and also the pace.But the main reason I am not giving it a higher score was because the show was way too long.So what do I mean about that?There were only eight episodes - compared to Koreans normal sixteen, but out of those eight episodes, I saw the same scene over and over again just from a different angle or to give me new information.It just got too much in the end, because the show had already hinted or showed most of the information, so I only got a few more new pieces. And most of them not really important.I had also guessed the ending around episode two or three, so it was not that cleaver.And if I had been Ji-an I would not have welcomed the ending at all - special after all the troubles and close calls...The show also seems like there will be a season two - and if not there is some major plot holes.They should properly just have made a movie instead...",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"Damn, does anyone do fight action better than Korean dramatists? Maybe but I sure don't know yet. I'm impressed with the creative action all around. The relationship dynamics between uncle and niece are unique and in many ways very positive preparations for dealing with living in a crazy world where trust must be earned. There's more to survival than relying on basic instincts--making the most of what's available and focusing are right on target IMO. Interesting take on chosen / created families too. For all the violence issues of collateral damage/murder of noncombatants/civilians are raised. And the difference between psychopaths and rational humans who've made certain career choices--yeah, there IS a difference. Another thing to think about is all that firepower--all those weapons, drones and bombs--indeed there's a lot of it in our world right now. Scary. Still a very enjoyable guilty pleasure watching for what interesting action, character twist, idea concept is coming next. Oh that damn couch... love it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"I just finished watching this series and decided to give it a 6/10. I know maybe it""s such a low rating for a series that has good action sequences but I had to do it.The main reason I gave it such a low score was because of how the director presented this series. If you ever watched the original Saint Seiya The Sanctuary Arc, you may find the similarity with this series. For every action the main character about to jump on, the story would flashback to the time where he/she was trained to deal with such situation. In Saint Seiya case it worked because: 1. It was an anime 2. It was produced in the 80's. But A Shop For Killers is a live action, and the year is 2024!I almost fell asleep every time the story does this! And episode 7 is the worst!Excruciating 6/10.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"Lee Dong-wook's performance in ""A Shop for Killers"" really stands out for its complexity and depth. His portrayal of a character grappling with moral ambiguities while transitioning from a dark figure to one of ethical grounding demonstrates his exceptional acting range. Dong-wook has this unique ability to captivate the audience, making his character's journey emotionally engaging, even when he's only present in flashbacks. This showcases not just his talent, but also his significant impact on the narrative. His contribution to the series not only deepens the plot but solidifies his status as a versatile actor in the Korean entertainment scene.

With its enthralling storyline, it feels like the series could have been completed in just 5 or 6 episodes.The initial half of the series captivates and engages viewers with its enthralling storyline, prompting the feeling that the entire series could have been condensed into just 5 or 6 episodes. The narrative focuses on the lead actor's journey to improve her skills and make smart decisions, yet ultimately feels like a waste of time due to the character's lack of strategic moves and inability to remain composed in crucial situations. The story attempts to showcase character development, but falls short in execution. With only 8 episodes to work with, there's a need for more depth and detail from various angles. Rather than introducing minor conflicts, such as the uncle subplot, which could have been resolved swiftly in 20 minutes, the series prolongs less impactful scenes, such as the final chase sequence, with insipid dialogue.It could be better.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Plus a predictable resolution, forgettable dialogue and the now tiring Korean character traits that are overused on villains.. and you get something that wasn't particularly satisfactory to me. Specially because it seems to try and use too many ideas, while something simpler would have been better.Still, I feel like it could be a popular series for the average viewer!

tt26450613,"Heyo, people. Recently, I just finished watching another show. It's Korean and it's called A Shop for Killers. And I'd like to write a review for it.The story is very well-written. Well, it is based on a novel. What I wanna say the story is little different than we are used to. The story's stuck in one place throughout the eight episodes, but it is interwoven with the main characters' past. This show is 'bout a girl named Jeong Ji-an. She lived with her uncle, Jeong Jin-man, until it began to seem he died. The reason why she stayed at her uncle's, is that her parents out of nowhere passed away (well, were killed). With the uncle's death, Ji-an begins to uncover secrets about him, and why she's the target of some crazy shooters...I liked the unique style of the story. As I mentioned before, it was based on the past of the characters. Every episode gets wilder as we uncover the secrets and things that happened. It was thrilling, and the ending was an absolute icing on the cake, I can say.The acting of the actors was amazing as well. We got to see Ji-an's childhood, and how she spent time with her uncle. TBH, in some scenes, I was little angry because of her behavior, but I guess I found an easy explanation... girl's puberty. Lol.In my opinion, we got to see an another amazing show at the start of this year, and that makes it even more cool. A little fun fact is that I watched is together with Hazbin Hotel, because both shows' episodes were coming out around the same dates.Another fun fact: this show is full of self-defense skills. And because I was visiting the self-defense class for the past few moths, I recognized some moves, and it became a cool example for another moves.I give it 10/10.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"I can't say the series is bad, but I can't give it high praises either.The start is promising and I enjoyed Lee Dongwook in this role of a merc with morals teaching his niece how to survive, which is the underlying theme.There are plenty of action scenes, well made, technically advanced war gadgets giving me goosebumps. But also a lot of useless cruelty hidden in kind of revenge plot without a true explanation and for me not plausible. I often kept wondering why the heck they are fighting each other, seemed like fighting for fighting's sake.The story unravels in backflips giving explanations of Jians upbringing. Not bad per se but it's overdone as you're going to see the same thing over and over again without adding much value. Especially the 7th episode, I skipped most of it. A regular timeline would have been better as well as expanding on character development and closing plot holes. The villain is just a one dimensional bad ass.Highlights next to LDW were the Muan Thai teaching guy and the Korean version of Laura Craft Minhye.While acting etc is good, the series action packed, it's not compelling enough for me to make it onto the watch again list.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"As an AI language...Just kidding, this is my first time writing a review for something in IMDB and only because this series has defied my expectations.The direction, editing, and screenplay are so precise. In my opinion, not a single frame is wasted. The many flashbacks, camera angles, and acting are a far cry from the many action series of the past.The fight choreography, as many others have already mentioned, is top-notch and not over the top. The visual effects are not distracting as they should be.From the first episode to the last, the mystery only continues to intrigue the audience. And I'm certainly wanting for more!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"At this point what do you expect from Lee Dong-wook, if he's in it... it must be a great project and this show doesn't disappoint at all, the entire cast was amazing but my standouts are, Guem Hae-na playing Min-hye a kick a$$ assassin, Lee Dong-wook a merc with a moral compass, Seo Hyun-woo a hilarious bad guy, Jo Han-sun a psychopath that truly made you believe he was just that, and Min Kim as Pasin the coolest merc since Deadpool. Imagine your under siege by contracted mercs without a clue of why, what do you do? Panic? Or use the tools you were raised with... this story will subvert all your expectations, best believe you won't see it coming!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,This show was disappointing. The modern high tech fighting with drones and action are quite impressive but that's all that's good. Maybe too violent for some.The order of the unfolding of the story is wrong.The story is too fragmented and unnecessarily so. A linear storyline would have been easier to follow and had more impact. The jumping in time is confusing even if you concentrate. Ep 7 filled in what happened earlier but it would have been better if the whole back story had been shown earlier. The mercenary background should have been shown earlier. Too many episodes spent wondering why they were being attacked and what LDW did. Why keep it a secret? The villains are one dimensionally evil. Unusual for K drama.The lighting it too dark for TV. Many fight scenes were in darkness.The ending was incomplete. Didn't explain how LDW survived. Bale is still alive. Is there a season 2? If there isn't then this show wasn't worth the time. If there is maybe they can explain all the unanswered questions and it might be good. But why didn't they just film and stream all 16 episodes in one shot and complete everything.Kim Hye Jun does a good job in a tricky role. Quite convincing. Lee Dong Wook is quite convincing as the broody mercenary and a bit more disheveled than usual.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"Certainly not a mindless action series. Action is blended with 2, interlinked, back stories. And that's the catch.Some would say the action is not relentless, nor spectacularly choreographed. But rather pressing, comes in small waves. Although the series begins in the heat of battle. The story is the main bill. The interweaving is well done. You aren't sure who is who, who's is on which side. Then the stories unfolds slowly , chapter by chapter.Action is tertiary. Story, layout, editing 1st. Acting, direction 2nd. Case in point is the connection of all characters and storyline is only fully explained in the 2nd last episode.This attention to detail is why Kdramas such as this one are so well worth it to watch. Compare to others like Fubar, Tulsa King. Just hopes that part 2 can be as restraint and not just a bloodbath.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The way the story concluded left me wanting more, and I believe that the owners of this movie have the potential to create an even more remarkable second season.

Heartbreaking, violent, surprising, compelling characters (both good and bad) and so much fun to watch.It has everything: plenty of characters to root for (and against) in an entertaining and.clevrly told storyline. Uses time shifts to great effect, to tell a story of Jeong Jian, who loses her parents in an apparent murder suicide, and is raised by her uncle Jeong Jinman who seeminly runs an specialty hardware store. But all is not as it seems, with clever hints given out over the first episode that something more is a foot. When her strict, but stand offish Uncle apprently commits suicide, which Jian believes is too out of character. The thrill ride action starts, and frankly, never stops over the 8 episodes (about 50 minutes each).TV really doesn;'t get much better than this, and stands in line with the really great South Korean actions series of the last year (Bargain, Worst of Evil, Moving, Revenge of Others)",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

He adores her but feigns indifference and she has a hard upbringing which will be advantageous later as the words of advice and hard lessons her Uncle gave her will come to save her life on many occasions. It is an interesting story and well acted with plenty of gruesome action which I think they should have dialled back on a little. The timeline is a bit muddled which leads to too much repetition and the plot has numerous holes but it is still worth a watch as the good bits are really good.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,"Popular actor (Tale of the Nine-Tailed, Goblin) Lee Dong-wook shines in this gripping thriller drama as he smoothly transitions from a morally gray character to a man of ethics and family. He might have been killed off in the first episode, but the use of flashback sequences is enough to influence his magnetic presence on the screen.With multiple villains and arch rivals, A Shop for Killers begins with chaos and a slow pace but quickly piques the interest of its audience with a flashback monologue. Despite some vague sequences, loose ends or unexplained actions by the characters, this suspenseful drama is well rounded and executed when it comes to intense drama and vengeance. The dynamic uncle-niece relationship reflects a deep bond of trust and unspoken love between two lonely family members as they fight back the unscrupulous killers in their own way. Whether it's the fight scenes or emotionally driven main characters, this thriller will keep you hooked and wanting for more even when it concludes Season 1.My Rating : 8/10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt26450613,One of worse I've seen. The only thing bearable was Min-hye and it still makes me want to vomit and die. There was zero moment where I could sit and think WOW this person is so cool. 8 episode in after the millions flashbacks and relationship development between the uncle and niece that doesn't make you sympathy for them at all and if you're looking forward to the training scene to see how cool she was don't because it only make you want to vomit out of boredom. It was understandable how overwhelmed and shocking it must be for the main character to comprehend but at least make her do something around episode 4 or 5 beside being stupid. If there's a season 2 please let me know so I can print out the script and use it to wipe my ass with it.,negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

I appreciate his looks here because it was toned down from the usual super filtred one to a very natural look wich is more suitable for the charachter he's playing.

tt26450613,"1. I like a series that doesn't have the typical duration of 16 episodes. They are often bloated and hard to watch without fast forwarding through recaps and annoying musical montages. These 8 episodes left me wanting more.2. The pacing is good. All episodes come in at 50 - 60 minutes.3. The cast is great. Characters are interesting, charismatic, attractive, and relate well with each other. Even enemies have chemistry.4. The mystery is there. Suspense built in. The plot interesting. Plot twists are abundant.5. The bad guys are bad. The good guys can be bad and are still sympathetic. Characters feel well drawn out.6. Our hero is a girl. From the get go she is smart. She makes mistakes out of genuine naïveté then picks herself up and carries on. She doesn't become jaded or spoiled by the violence thrust upon her but is able to maintain her humanity.7. Our hero's uncle, played by lee dong work, doesn't look like his previous and too highly groomed characters. He's rough and handsome. He's a bad guy who's also a good guy. His character carries great pathos.8. There is only one episode that felt at times redundant. Yet it did provide more insight into just how the story got to that point.9. The series is up there with My Name, another 8 episode series that provided mystery, surprise, suspense, and catharsis.

The setting of the shop serves as the perfect backdrop for the unfolding drama. The dim lighting, eerie ambiance, and the constant threat of danger create an atmosphere that is both thrilling and unsettling.

A lot of heart broken moments like when the uncle died, when the pretty lady lost the grip on her gun... deserve more attention. It was not ""shocking"" enough to make you want to stick around.However it's actually quite slow to my taste. And definitely too slow when you're expecting an action thriller.

You need to be focused and engaged to pick up on the subtleties that do such a great job supporting the overall story.Through the 8 episode season, we keep returning to the same story, but each time with slightly more background information on the total plot. The beauty of this show is it assumes its audience is smart and SHOWS you rather than telling you-allowing us to put the pieces together. Very exciting!Like most dramas, by the end I was so caught up and involved with all of the characters that I felt a sense of sadness and longing. The arch with Bale is not concluded, we don't know what happened to Minhye and Pashin, and the return of Jeong Jinman! I need to know how he pulled that off! It wasnt until my 2nd time watching the series that I noticed he KNEW the recording was fake cuz he instructed his niece to scream his name 3 times if ever in trouble.The series is jam packed with small logical explanations for all the deus ex machina type scenarios, which is so refreshing when it does go back in time to explore how exactly those coincidences played out.

The mystery of the uncle was also well constructed, revealing the truth slowly and through the flashbacks. The ending was, in addition, especially good, but left a lot of questions unanswered.Finally, the performances were all enjoyable by everyone in the cast and, especially, the two main leads.

I checked this out due to Lee Dongwook being on the cover and oh my God I'm so glad I did. I've seen him do more comedic roles recently but the depth he showcases in this complicated character is truly something and pretty much solidifies him as one of them most versatile and talented actors out there.

This is a fantastic narrative, and I'm interested to see how the main character grows. I'm pleased there are no needless sexual scenes to entice viewers. However, the emphasis on family values, culture, religion, and life lessons makes this valuable to me.

The bad guys were very unlikeable (a korean production tecnique). The young Jian friend you could just wring his neck.

The story and characters hook you from the very beginning and it is so thrilling and upbeat you never get your eyes of the screen ( literally binged it for the whole 8 episodes)The fighting choreographies are AWESOME and you can tell the immensely amount of work the main leads have put into not only to get in shape but to completely get into the mindset of a boxer and a fighter, they make the characters so believable and genuine.I have followed Woo Do-hwan for a long time and I just cant get enough of his acting, loved his tender, caring yet fierce character here.I absolutely loved the two main leads personalities and how well one compensates the other. They have such a strong and beautiful bond and friendship.If i have to find some faults ( even when this was almost perfect) is maybe the length ( probably 2 episodes too long) and the dragging of the main plot, when the bad guys keep getting away with everything and the good guys make mistakes a bit too obvious, which it gets frustrating at times.Also I loved the Tempted mini reunion with his old co start and friend Kim Min-jae, shame that they didn't have any scenes together!Heo Joon Ho needs a special mention as well, as the good guy ( for once!)

It has brotherhood, bloody fight, mukbang, and above all, it's a fast pace show. The choreography of the fights in this show is also well done. It's just as good as another korean show from Netflix, My name. The martial arts or fight actions scenes in modern korean movies and tv shows are arguably better than any other action movies whether it's from hollywood, or outside of hollywood. They has more realistic fights. It's fast and furious literally. They don't have those showy exaggerated moves that look like choreographed dance. Unfortunately, this show also has those typical cliche moments like My Name especially those tear-jerky ones. That's my biggest pet peeve in korean tv shows and movies. Although there's a sudden change of pace (It was quite a ride until episode 6), and the ending is a bit rushed and shortened, overall, the show is quiet entertaining. The fight scenes are worth visit more than once. I give solid 7.5/10.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt26315487,"I agree with every positive review here. The action scenes are gripping and fun to watch but there is also a sense of brotherhood and found family watching these people bond together. Absolutely loved it.However all of it changes after episode 6. A lot of the main cast are killed off or disappear to mourn and it feels like the feeling of the family being built up was all for nothing, and suddenly everything is unusually easy for the main guys and there is a bunch of comedy everywhere when the series before episode 7 was dark, gritty and serious. Throughout the show, a girl is introduced to the main duo of friends and they become a real team. Then when her grandpa dies instead of sticking with the team, she suddenly wants to go to Rome?? It felt very out of character for her and the very next episode (episode 7), they replace her with another girl that we do not know. She seemed normal enough until suddenly she is an archer who has no issues possibly killing people? The show does not even try to explain this. They replaced a lot of the main characters with cheap copies and continues the story, except the story also doesn't make sense. A plot point was they needed to find a way to contact a very powerful individual in Korea (chaebol) and they didn't do it before episode 7 because it was too hard yet in episode 7 they do it instantly by just messaging them on Instagram? And they instantly become best friends? And also they just instantly befriended a guy that was on the villain's side, a guy that they hated and had witnessed almost kill a homeless guy in the first episodes?? It felt like they got new writers or some actors had to leave and they were stuck with what to do with the last two episodes, which kind of killed the show for me. The quality of the writing dropped so steeply so quickly it felt off. Before the last two episodes the show was very serious, it had its moments here and there for sweet moments and laughs but the villains were real scary threats and the fights felt tense and powerful. Everything post episode 6 felt like a joke and it was all suddenly so easy and everything seemed to fall into place without the main guys even having to try.My point is the show is amazing UNTIL the last two episodes. I wish I didnt watch them and just remembered this show for its first six amazing episodes. The reason why this is an 8/10 is those six episodes but it would have been a 10 if it wasnt for the last two. The last two by themselves are a 3/10 at best.I do recommend watching this show but maybe stop watching after the 6th to keep up the great image of the show.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt26315487,"What can I say about this Action/Crime/Thiller Series? It just has the right stuff simply put, the right amounts of what makes an Action/Crime movie like say The Raid 2 great, The Bloodhounds story spans 8 episodes with a total running time of about 9 hrs and there is never a dull moment, it trully has a lot of elements mixed into the story to keep you interested throughout, I say the series in 2 days, could have watched it in 1 night if I didn't have to work in the morning, this series pulls no punches but never goes to extreme levels, as examples of Extremes: The Raid 2 & The Night Comes for Us come to mind, this falls a notch below. On the violence scale like say The Man from Nowhere, but it's 85% Fists Fights and Bats with about 15% Knife Fights, Just Perfection in my opinion, This production crew and writters should immediately start producing Season 2, could even use Different actors like True Detective Series did, After Watching Bloodhounds, Imagine that type of story told in the 1400s,1800s, maybe even 1930s because even the same story type completely changes the feel of everything with the era, This Series struck Solid Gold in My Opinion, Thank You, and Can We please another one.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Few scenes are really stupid and you'll feel like they are overdoing the action just to show fist fight.And the end is so abrupt and just like that every person has a contact person who does the job for everyone.

tt26315487,"The series is good until the 7th episode, however, some parts of the storytelling are trivial enough. Some examples:the boys are running away without asking help in a scene;one of the means of the boys goes faulty and the other protagonist makes nothing to approach the others in order to simplify their escape;However the plot in general has a strong structure and a good narration at least until 7th episode.There are many fights which are cruel enough. Some kind of excessive kindness inexplicable in cruel moments which degrades in servility also against villains. In this case the characters seem too much stereotyped unable to change their attitude.Last episode is sufficient if not mediocre. Just as example: a villain could kill a kidnapped person although wounded but escapes suddenly albeit has the time to kill him. This example highlights a poor script. Indeed, it seems that the story is based on forced circumstances and forced happy moments. Also the involvement of a minor character in the fight seems out of context.Moreover, last episode suffers a storytelling rather simplified such as the introduction of some sporadic funny moments and funny character as well, which contrast with the brutal context.I believe that this series deserves a sequel but improving the quality.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The initial, first second, episodes are really good. Great cinematography, good writing, lots of production value and most of the time a nice concept to build upon. You can always tell that about half or more of the production money went to that one - two episodes. And then....It all goes downhill. Whatever the initial concept was it will always end up a group of people going against some type of villain. They will sit and talk and eat and plan various unintelligent ways to attack the villain. They will attack but for some reason the villain will escape their grasp. Then the villain will attack and probably kill one or two of them. This back and forth will continue depending on how many episodes the season has and at the end the good guys finally will do what they should have done a dozen episodes back. All the above while the tone of the series will flactuate between very moving scenes and cringy slapstick humor.This show unfortunately does not escape this pattern.

""Another South Korean gem on Netflix"", I thought.But as time went on, I found it to be overly violent. While it sure can be expected from an action series, at some points it became a bit much. However, this isn't even the thing that made me lower my rating.What made my blood boil is this: you mean to tell me that ""the good guys"", aka Tae Ho and his crowd, kidnapped & tortured Kim Myung Il's man, attempted to kill another one- and then went to drink and have fun without expecting a counter-attack? The fact that all of them are caught unprepared for an attack they could have anticipated bugs me so much. Imagine being in a war and not expecting an attack- it just doesn't make sense. Tae Ho, who can't even walk, only has a measly gun to protect himself, which he conveniently keeps next to all of his money and golden plates. So that whenever he's attacked he can just give them?The attempt at bro energy with the CEO in the last episodes is completely unconvincing.In the last episode, a girl uses a bow and arrows to participate in a fight. Which made me think: the entire group of ""bad guys"" decides to kill Gun Woo and Woo Jin, but none of them has a gun? They all just gathered to beat them to death? So they just watch the arrows fly to them.Also, the ""pure evil"" vs ""good"" guys plot is a bit overused. But the writers did manage to make the action entertaining.(Not so) fun fact: The girl playing Hyun Soo was kicked out of the drama due to DUI. She crashed into several trees and structures and caused power outages. Basically, her entire career has been finished due to that incident. According to her managing agency, she has apparently worked part time to support herself because she had to pay for all the damages and had nothing left (allegedly). Reportedly she's also banned from public networks? She has been an actress her whole life basically. While this is a serious incident, I do not like how her entire life can be ruined and how everyone turned their back on her.

destroying the store before the protagonist arrived so where is the police?In the 3 episode we found that the guy our protagonists are working for was left in a wheelchair by the guys that destroyed the store.And i again ask myself, they burn a building, drop a man from a building and no police, no crime, everything is good.I know it's a show and it shouldn't reflect reality, i can understand that in the first case the police don't come because they are bribed or corrupted, the bad guy has a lot of influence and money.But on the second instance? He was only a normal guy, no contacts, no connections, and he gets away with attempted murder, arson, assault.If this is Korea reality i would much prefer North Korea, at least there the rules are clear, in South Korea they can kill you and bribe the way out of jail.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt26315487,"Bloodhounds, the TV show, had a lot of potential when it first aired. With an intriguing premise and a strong opening, it seemed like a thrilling ride was in store for viewers. However, as the series progressed, the quality took a nosedive, leaving audiences disappointed and frustrated.The initial episodes of Bloodhounds were gripping and captivating, drawing viewers in with a compelling mystery and well-developed characters. The plot had an air of suspense, and the introduction of the main characters showed promise for a complex and engaging narrative. The chemistry among the cast members was evident, and it seemed like the foundation was set for an exceptional series.Unfortunately, as the show progressed, it became apparent that the main characters in Bloodhounds were making some incredibly questionable decisions. Their actions often defied common sense, leading to a frustrating viewing experience. It felt as though the writers were attempting to inject a level of absurdity reminiscent of Zoolander when the main characters made decisions.One of the biggest flaws in Bloodhounds was the inconsistent character development. The initial depth and complexity of the protagonists gradually diminished, leaving them feeling one-dimensional and unrelatable. The decisions they made seemed driven more by plot convenience rather than genuine motivations or character growth. This lack of consistency significantly undermined the emotional investment viewers had in the show.Moreover, the decline in writing quality was mirrored by a decrease in production value. Scenes that were once beautifully shot and meticulously crafted became haphazard and rushed. The overall attention to detail seemed to wane, resulting in a disconnect between the story and its visual presentation.While there were occasional moments of brilliance, such as a few well-executed plot twists, they were unfortunately overshadowed by the overall decline in the show's quality. Viewers who had invested their time and energy in the hopes of a satisfying conclusion were ultimately left disappointed.In conclusion, Bloodhounds started off strong but failed to maintain its momentum. The initial promise and intrigue faded as the show progressed, with the main characters' decisions resembling those of characters from Zoolander-unbelievable and frustrating. The lack of consistent character development and declining production value further contributed to the show's downfall. Despite some occasional bright spots, Bloodhounds ultimately failed to live up to its early potential, leaving audiences longing for a more fulfilling and well-executed series.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt26315487,"Honestly, I've seen people calling it unrealistic but it doesn't matter because the drama keeps you hooked. It's a good drama but the problem is in 5-6 episode they removed the nice characters. Even the female lead left after ep 6 which was annoying I expected more from her. I thought she will take a revenge for her grandfather but she was nowhere to be found. Even the nice characters who died, they didn't show any backstory of what happened to them in the end. The ending was good but how they did not cleared it out to the audience was very annoying. I'm mostly disappointed by the female lead leaving the drama in the middle and they also didn't show what happened to the victim's family who were in danger. That thing is going to bother you. Overall it's a good drama the boxing and the stunts were mind blowing. It will keep you hooked. The bromance in the show was really cute. Amazing acting.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt26315487,"Normally i don't like to do spoiler reviews. I prefer to simply give a general opinion so my review can be read by peoples who are looking for opinions before watching something. But this show was all over the place and i have to make a rather long and spoiler full review...all over the place as well.So lets start by the obvious, the Covid narrative. It does serve a purpose to the story like for instance why peoples are masked at time, and why some characters can't travel etc. Yet watching this in 2024 really reminded me of bad memories and i wish it does not become a stapple of entertainement to use it. I moved on from Covid myself and its like it never existed for me. Im sick of it, litterally. But obviously in this case i won't fault the show for it.The action is sometimes amazing but its also so over the top that it can also become a bit ridiculous. I know its typical of asian movies or shows to have these huge 20-25 men vs 1 or 2 and they all take their turn getting beat up... The show do try to find way around at times but other times its too obvious the bad guys are just waiting their turn. In an MMA world like we live in, even if the show focus on boxers, you would think SOMEONE would know some ground stuff. Actually we do see some of it at the very end from a side chracter, but its really the only time. At times the characters absorbe insane ammount of punishements wich would had KO them 20 times and/or have broken limbs. Like that subway fight where they get hit by baseball bat multiple times.Plot wise the show is all over the place. As a tie up to the action scenes in the paragraphe above, and once again focussing on ""suspend your disbelieves"", its really surprising so few peoples actually use guns and that nobody even have a katana. I know its South Korea and not Japan, but the bad guys could kill the good guys so many times if they had guns or even swords. They always bring baseball only exept at the very end where they have machete.The 2 main characters also refuse so much to kill peoples even when it would definately save them a lot of trouble or even in situation where they been ambushed to get killed. But you have side characters who are introduced around mid season who are basically assassins and kill a TON of them. Yet it seem bad guys keep spawning back. I know the main baddy is rich but where do he find all these goons? And after seeing so many of your coworker die, why would you keep working for him?Now i want to go deeper in the plot itself cause this is really what made me lower my note. Show start great with our 2 leads and then a female of their age is added, Yeong-Ju, so they become a nice trio. Then you have the 2 assassins added mid season who are badass and switch up the action.Sadly at one point a big twist happen and pretty much everybody die or is gone beside our leads. I read the actress who played Yeong-Ju had a DIU and thats why she was cut from the show, but her disapearance REALLY hurt the narrative even if they find another female to replace her at the end. And there is a big time gap and really the flow of the show is affected by it.Ultimately the big payoff of the last episode does not really have the same value and even if our 2 lead have been training for months off camera and its explained by the show, it kinda felt like the bad guy won and then they remembered they had to find an ending so they added 2 extra episodes to wrap it up.Finally there is a bit of nonsense here and there that also made me cringe a bit like that one time where Gung-Wu is just waiting for them to run to the car instead of going in reverse to meet them or characters getting drunk completely in the middle of a war pretty much.Ultimately i had lots of fun with the show still. Its bloody, its violent, full of action, but the ""third act"" really felt disjoincted compare to the rest and they killed off too many characters. I was expecting one of them to die sure, but not so many.Surprisingly it does not end on a cliff hanger like pretty much every US shows does. But if there is a Season 2 ill watch it. I wish they would bring back the actress who played Yeong-Ju. She didn't killed anybody in real life... forgive her.To everyone who read til the end... thanks. Lol.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt26315487,"A character was written out due to a D. U. I. Incident (Drunk Driving). Who made that decision? Netflix? The director Kim Joo Hwan? Now I don't want to belittle the real life incident but nobody got hurt.To write this character out was a way over the top reaction. It had huge significant changes, the staff had to rewrite the script, the cast, crew, the whole production for the remaining two episodes. I read one article filming was complete then they rewrote and redid the last two episodes.Simply put episodes 1-6 a masterpiece in Korean cinema, and would have been as big if not bigger than Squid Game, and with it international fans and acclaim! But the utter mess and it can only be described politely as an utter mess of episodes 7 and 8 sink this to a low 5 star, I really regret watching the remaining two butchered episodes.In one article director Kim Joo Hwan says ""Some of the actors who came out with Kim Sae Ron have lost their parts completely. They probably feel like this is unfair. I tried to take scenes out like this and like that. I felt bad. The Netflix officials and I tried our best. "" What does he mean? Some of the actors who came out? Came out in support? In the same article the director goes on about the effect all this has had on his health.It all comes back to who made the decision to write her out? Netflix? The Director? And why the extreme actions of doing this? Who made this way over the top decision are to blame for this total utter mess not the actress involved in the D. U. I. Incident. I think the hint is the above quoted article "" The Netflix officials and I tried our best.

While hollywood is strictly following the ""successful formula"", Korean TV-Shows are creating prodcuts which are simply entertaining.This is definitely not a masterpiece, there's a lot of logic issues with the plot and reminds a lot about movies from 90-s. And as it turns out, it's exactly what I've needed: good action movie with a bit of drama. There's no cliffhanger for season 2, just a finished story and I like it a lot.Action is very good and I was anticipating each fight with great interest. Paritally, because I was afraid for some characters, as I knew that they're in danger. Plot wasn't overwhelmed by unnecessary love story. Dramatic component is directed at family and friendship and, in my opinion, it was a great decision.Each episode moved the plot forward. Despite the fact, that ending is a bit weak, the road which leads to it has many twists. I was always curious to know what is going to happen next and some episodes really caught me off guard with events.In conclusion, I highly recommend watching Bloodhounds.

tt26315487,"""Bloodhounds"" reminded me a little of ""My Name,"" one of the most spectacular thrillers I've seen in a long time. If you go into this series thinking it's just about two boxers mixing it up, you're only scratching the surface. As with so many fantastic Korean shows, there's so much more going on, and you barely have to watch even half of the first episode to realize that this story-like so many others-is like an onion. Peel back one layer, and there's another one waiting. That's the sophistication of the writing of this series.Kim Geon Woo is a professional boxer who is doing all he can to help his mother pay the rent on the small café that she owns. Little does Geon Woo realize that his mother has taken out a loan, via one of the most notorious loan sharks in the business. The story is set during COVID-19 when so many businesses are struggling to survive, and so many of them are turning to alternative means to try and keep going. Unfortunately, this falls right into the hands of Kim Myung Gil, a ruthless mob boss. You might be a little surprised to find that Geon Woo is polite and courteous, even when he's knocking his opponents down, he rushes over to make sure they're all right.Hong Woo Jin is the fiery, impulsive professional boxer who is actually a bit familiar with the loan shark world, as he's been a ""bloodhound"" which is basically another word for a ""collector."" After losing to Geon Woo in a fight, he's shocked when Geon Woo wants to strike up a friendship. Woo Jin is pulled back into the loan shark world when Geon Woo is ruthlessly beaten in his attempt to defend his mother.Both fighters are soon brought under the protective umbrella of Choi Tae Ho, a former powerful loan shark who's only too familiar with Myung Gil and his tactics. Choi Tae Ho now uses his immense wealth to give out principal-only loans (no interest) to those in desperate need. However, once he finds out that Myung Gil is behind the series of plots to take over a building in order to open a casino and bleed foreign customers dry, Choi Tae Ho comes out of the shadows to try and bring Myung Gil down, his former lieutenant.The series is brutally honest and realistic in its violence, which can be difficult to watch. As good as Woo Jin and Geon Woo are, they can't escape getting beaten, battered, and bruised, including cutting up their knuckles. It's one of those rare times when you realistically see that knuckles get cut up during a fight, which impressed me, since this is a detail that most scenes of this caliber too often overlook.Myung Gil is a fantastic villain, and a series like this can only go so far as how good the villain is. He's smart, cunning, and absolutely ruthless threatening to punish anyone who gets in his way like a massive tidal wave. However, like so many people like Myung Gil, he believes he's untouchable, and that ultimately leads to his downfall.I was incredibly impressed with Woo Do Hwan (Geon Woo) and Lee Sang Yi (Woo Jin). They must have trained with professional fighters, because their movements and tactics are spot on! And they also do it so fast and effectively, that you'll likely marvel at the fight scenes! I'd be curious how long it took to choreograph just one fight scenes (and there are a number of them throughout this 8-episode series).The Korean underworld is dark. The sun doesn't even really come out. Even in the daytime, it's cloudy, as if marking the level of corruption that dwells within the city of Seoul. Too many times, we actually wonder if this small group can finally come out on top over Myung Gil. Each time Geon Woo, Woo Jin, and Choi Tae Ho score a point, Myung Gil finds a way to score two. The entire series plays out very much like a boxing match. Two sides, bobbing, weaving, trying to outthink their opponents, while scoring a hit and then moving back into defensive mode.What impressed me the most was the naivety of Geon Woo and Woo Jin. They may be able to box, but they know very little about the Korean mob world and what to do. They are anxious and eager to help, but Choi Tae Ho and his lieutenants have to teach them and share the wisdom of their own experiences.This is an intense but bingeworthy series! As soon as you finish one episode, you immediately have to keep going to find out what happens next. By the time the series is over, you feel like you need to sit in the corner to get a breather!The story is tautly written, and the performances throughout are absolutely spot-on!

Please make another season...the acting was impeccable and I love the two leads and how they complement each other in different ways, the fights scenes are amazing and are like John wick fight scenes but with no guns and no music and way more realistic, the amount of effort needed for the leads to play this role would be hard work, to get in shape and to get into the mind set of a team boxer really shows in this tv show... amazing!",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt26315487,"A+ - ""Bloodhounds"" was an absolutely phenomenal watch that I would recommend to anybody on the hunt for something new. The plot was gripping and intense, and the pace of how the story developed was spot-on. The excellent timing of the plot allowed for a dynamic and emotionally charged character development timeline that I believe a lot of watchers will appreciate because despite the intensity, it still felt carefully done and nothing felt rushed at any point. One thing that I was particularly impressed by was the fight choreography. The early boxing scenes, although brief, were very well done, and compliments the opening to the show perfectly. I found myself thoroughly enjoying the fight scenes more and more as the season progressed. I highly recommend this show! For me, it's EASILY at least 8-9.5/10.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The actors play their part very well, even the secondary and supporting cast give a good performance.The recent TV series out of Hollywood are either too commercialized or too Woke. All style, no substance nor logic.Thankfully there are great shows like Bloodhounds coming out from Korea to fill in the gap. Hope they keep it up and come out with many shows like this.A season 2, whether continuation or a new story, would still be worth 10 series coming out of the West.

tt26315487,"I watched this series partly because of the high ratings, but I was disappointed. Again. Disappointed because it annoys me that so many Korean action series follow exactly the same stupid narrative structure: Good guys have a run in with a group of very bad gangsters. Good guys band together and manage to deliver a powerful blow to the gangsters.So far so good, but here is where everything goes south. The good guys do not finish the gangsters off. Instead they split up and go around doing their usual thing as if nothing has happened. As if they have completely forgotten who they have just been messing with. Not a care in the world. Good guy goes home to his pregnant wife and seems surprised and outraged when the bad guys kick in his front door to kill him and his wife. Who would have thought that was going to happen? Answer: Everybody with half a brain.Really, the way the good guys get caught with their pants around their ankles when they should have been setting their defenses up for when the inevitable retaliation was coming around is so annoying that you almost start rooting for the bad guys. So much stupidity is unforgivable.Now I must say that the acting and fight scenes are all very well done, but here is the second thing that annoyed me throughout the series: The two main characters are boxers, and all their fighting is done as if that is all they know. But it is mentioned over and over in the series they also were marines. Marines are trained killers who have been trained in all kinds off techniques to finish off an opponent. Yet all they seem to know when they are in mortal danger is how to use their fists. Makes no sense to me.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Gun Woo played by Woo Do Hwan is introduced as a nice kid protectinf his mother and with a good heart but i feel like he hides a lot of hatered in there especially after he kept beating up unconscious kang In beom. The villains were portrayed veeery well. Everybody delivered except for Sae ron ... i feel like she could have played the role a bit better, she could have expressed her anger a bit better... However the survival of Mr Choi was bit unrealistic, he was stabbed several time and beaten up really well and thrown out of the window..... and still survived with only a forever broken leg... how come ? A part from that i like how the boys stuck to their principles being boxers and used no weapons... the fight scenes were GREAT especially those with Mr Lee and Mr Hwang ...... i really stood up in front the tv to focus.

I saw some comments saying that it went down the hill towards the end, but I thought that the series kept constantly its good quality.I think that the heartwarming bromance was well depicted and was the key element that made Bloodhounds so good to watch.

tt26315487,"Another dumb example of Korea's inability to grasp the concept that lethal force to protect friends, family, and loved ones is NOT a bad thing.This show is FILLED with bad guys wielding lethal weapons, threatening to KILL the protagonists (even shouting it out loud more than a few times), and then actually killing people.But the protagonists continue to use their non-lethal (or even maiming) attacks over and over again. Worse, they let bad guys escape once they knock them out, tie them up, or subdue them. In one case, they even get medical care for the main goon, a guy who has killed countless people.Because of this, the bad guy numbers swell (the same thugs appear over and over) and cause countless lives to be ruined or lost entirely. Even leaving a pregnant woman without a husband. All the while the good guy numbers shrink as they are picked off one by one.I'm sure this was to set up the climactic final battle between the mains on both sides. But it falls flat because it is, 1. A boring fight that had nothing new over previous ones, and 2. The ludicrous things that needed to happen to lead up to it are so mind-bogglingly head-scratching, you're left groaning.In summary, Korean writers think protagonists need to be weak helpless sheep for the audience to appreciate them and root for them, when in fact, it makes the eventual outcomes even more lame, as they could have been avoided entirely.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The show starts off strong with the characters working against the antagonist, but towards the end it comes to a stopping point where you think that the characters lose only to have them try again, i feel that doing this kind if ruined the momentum. Another gripe that i have is the show's inability to let any character die, like when this one character got hit by a car and you saw thw blood under the car only for another character to say that she was in a coma, and another character got stabbed like 18 times but was fine in the next episode, regardless of these gripes you should definitely check out bloodhounds.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

The bromance that Gun-Woo and Woo-Jin show is beautiful and one that got me emotionally invested in the characters.

Since I had already invested some time, I continued watching the series till the end, but I had to fast forward a lot. The good guys are so stupid and resourceless! Their decisions make no sense. No wonder the evil guy always has the upper hand: he has all kinds of contacts to warn him or provide information, an army of thugs at hand and no scruples at all. He is always a step ahead. How come the good guys took no measures whatsoever once they decided to go against this psychopath? Come on, Choi doesn't get any armed bodyguards (armed with fire weapons o with some martial arts skills.) or why doesn't he at least have a panic room at home (where he keeps all his money and gold?) And, are there no banks in Korea or didn't this billionaire had the idea to send his money overseas, perhaps to Switzerland or the Caiman Islands? Surely he would have had the means to do it. Instead, he got robbed by the same guy three times!!! And, when some 30 thugs invade his house, did he really think he could stop them with a little gun? And couldn't he have at least closed the safe where he had his gold when he took the pistol? And why the unnecessary roughness of the brute against a crippled old man? Why kill Choi and the two cool knifers? Why so coldly, so easily, so fast? And why wasn't the actress ( got fired) who plays Choi's granddaughter replaced with another one instead of sending the character to Rome and putting a random archer girl along the way? Of course the heroes get the bad guy in the end, but it is not really satisfying. It's too little, too late.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Woo Do-Hwan plays an idealistic, honorable former elite Marine and good son trying to help his widowed mother get out of crushing debt.

I watched the English voiceover version which is very lazy of me not wanting to read subtitles, but it wasn't bad. The choreography here is amazing and our main heroes, Woo Do-Hwan and Sang-Yi Lee deliver an incredible performance. This show is rated TV-MA, and you can see why from its graphic fighting scenes, which totally surprised me. The fighting scenes include plenty of weapons except guns. Although punches and kicks make for a great fighting scene, there's an inexplicable absence of firearms. The bad guys carried objects such as bats, and no matter how many times they came out on the losing end, not a single gun was used by them, which didn't make sense because they are committing plenty of murders, they're just doing it the hard way. Do-Hwan, and Sang-Yi Lee share great on-screen chemistry, and the villain played by Kim Myung-gill, does a phenomenal job.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this.My only gripe would be Sae-Ron's character. She fell utterly flat compared to the old man's, bow-wielding granddaughter.

tt26315487,"The series Bloodhound certainly had potential, but unfortunately, it fails to maintain its initial promise as it progresses. While the first few episodes captivate the audience with a promising start, the later episodes take a disappointing turn towards incoherence and absurdity, leaving viewers questioning the direction and purpose of the story.One of the series' biggest drawbacks lies in its inability to sustain a cohesive narrative. The plotlines introduced in the beginning are either abandoned or poorly developed, leaving loose ends that are never tied up. This lack of consistency makes it difficult for viewers to invest in the story or connect with the characters on a deeper level.Moreover, the decisions made by the writers and directors in the later episodes appear to be driven by a desire to shock or surprise the audience, rather than serving the overall story. The narrative veers off into unnecessary tangents, introducing bizarre plot twists that contribute little to the plot and often feel forced. This constant barrage of nonsensical developments ultimately detracts from the viewing experience.In addition to the questionable storytelling choices, the series suffers from a decline in overall quality. The production values and attention to detail that were apparent in the early episodes seem to wane as the series progresses. The visual effects become less impressive, and the acting occasionally feels lackluster, further contributing to the overall disappointment.Despite its flaws, Bloodhound does showcase some redeeming qualities. The initial episodes demonstrate a strong potential for intriguing storytelling, with a cast of talented actors who show promise in their performances. The series also manages to create an atmospheric and visually appealing world, at least in its early stages, which initially draws viewers in.In conclusion, while bloodhound may captivate audiences with its promising start, it ultimately fails to deliver on its potential. The later episodes are marred by incoherence, absurdity, and a lack of direction, leaving viewers perplexed and unsatisfied. It is a disappointing outcome for a series that showed such initial promise.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Then he doesn't beat up any more anti-maskers? I was hoping he would beat up anti-vaxers too but that never happened! What the heck?

tt26315487,"This is a series that really wasn't produced for those of my generation, but instead will appeal to many others though (especially youngsters). So below review has to be taken in light of that.There's no point in dissecting this series. It's an unoriginal bog standard tale of young upstarts taking on an evil megalomaniac who is out to financially cheat & destroy the honest hard working salt of the earth citizens in Korea for his own gain. A David v Goliath style story.The general storyline follows the usual clichés, and in my view this was a two hour film that was stretched out with lots of filler into a Netflix series. Throw in Bond's Jaws nemesis, some inexplicably altruistic money lenders, corrupt cops and a feisty female sidekick (who just seems to disappear!), and you are left with a mess!The acting is plastic, the characters are clichés of the genre, the storyline very twee and the emotive music is so cringingly used that you can only squirm.Admittedly the fight scenes are kind of good and that's all there is worth watching it for.Despite my whining, there is an audience for this that will lap it all up, especially as the photogenic young leads are starlets for the younger viewers. Add in the good overcoming evil storyline, there's nothing challenging, so makes it easy to consume.Really there's not much more really to say. It's simply not for me, best left for the millennials who will more likely find it to be of interest.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

There were many holes in the storyline and it also became very messy without going into all the details. Even though it is a fictive story, it became increasingly unrealistic and also in terms of violence. It was as if the screenwriter was lost in his own fantasy at some point. I wish i could have rated it a 9 or 10, because that's how i felt after watching the first 4 episodes. I was left confused and disappointed after all this and especially the ending was sub par. All the events that had taken place became totally fragmented. This seriously had the potential to be a classic.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt26315487,"Why is this series rated 8 on IMDB?It starts like any other drama, with a simple premise, but in the first episode everything is forced by the script, which in my opinion is the biggest problem with this story. The entire drama is very fast-paced (in the wrong sense), they rushed the story a lot which ends up getting in the way and bothering a lot, to the point of leaving loose ends. But in addition to the holes in the script, the poorly organized premise, the very poorly made connections between characters who have never seen each other before, the poor construction of characters and villains, the worst thing is that it seems that the screenwriter was changed in the middle of the series.In short, the ending is horrible, with a simple and ridiculous solution and characters without any charisma, but the most ridiculous thing is that they try to connect the series and the people who are watching through covid.Some scenes are fun but nothing more than that, not to mention the gratuitous violence (attempt to generate impact I believe)Critical Rating: 3.0

Unfortunately the supporting actors aren't much better and I'm not sure it's entirely their fault since the script is also severely lacking.On the bright side there is a lot of action if your priority is fighting. The fight sequences are designed well otherwise the show would be an abject failure.The writing is not what you would expect from the quality that is often present in KDramas with a decent budget.

tt26315487,"Bloodhounds, a series that promises thrilling crime drama, falls short in delivering a realistic portrayal of law enforcement and civilian involvement. Throughout the series, it becomes increasingly apparent that the show lacks credibility, as the gang members seemingly have free reign to commit crimes without any consequences.One of the most glaring issues with Bloodhounds is the absence of civilians and police in crucial moments. In a world where criminal activities are rampant, it is highly improbable that there would be such a minimal presence of law enforcement or concerned citizens. The lack of realism is further highlighted in Season 1, Episode 6, where a group of 30 people brazenly invades an apartment block without raising any suspicion. It is baffling that no one finds this situation suspicious enough to call the police.The series attempts to portray a powerful antagonist who seemingly has control over the entire police department. However, this concept becomes increasingly difficult to believe as the show progresses. If this individual possesses such immense power, it is illogical to assume that he could commit heinous crimes in broad daylight without any repercussions, even in front of the police. This lack of consistency and believability undermines the credibility of the entire storyline.Furthermore, the episode where the protagonist calls the police while her house is being invaded by bikers is a prime example of the show's unrealistic portrayal of law enforcement response times. It is simply inconceivable that the police would take an unreasonably long time to arrive at the scene, especially when a citizen's safety is at stake. This blatant disregard for realism and common sense only serves to further frustrate viewers.In conclusion, Bloodhounds fails to deliver a believable and engaging crime drama due to its extreme lack of realism. The absence of civilians and police involvement, coupled with the gang members' ability to act with impunity, creates a frustrating viewing experience. While the series may have had potential, its unrealistic plotlines and disregard for logical storytelling ultimately make it difficult to enjoy.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt11691684,"That was awesome! Incredible ! Feeling like how much I say about this drama is not enough.
I've been seeing Korean dramas since many years ago (probably 8 years, less or more), and have seen more than 100 dramas till now. As I see, it was the best one among all of them!
Well, almostly every episod was so exciting, and the story, actors,etc all were amazing.
I strongly recommend it yo you.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"Even though the series is only halfway aired at the time of this review, I can tell this is going to be one of my all time favourites. I am not someone who usually watches kdramas (this is the second one I've ever watched), as I find some of the clichés that are often used in kdramas not that interesting (like for example the girl falling for a guy that is rude and demanding and by modern standards not boyfriend material). This series however does not feel at all clichéd, but rather, it's on par with some of the best international series I've seen so far.Each episode keeps you on your toes and guessing. It sets the protagonist (Baek Hee Sung/Do Hyun Soo) up as an unfeeling serial killer, but the audience is kept guessing after the truth. Despite Hee Sung's cold appearance, they make us care about him by showing his (faked or not? I still don't know) caring and loving side. Is he a serial killer who happens to be good at faking emotion, or is he a misunderstood man with antisocial personality disorder who doesn't realise he loves his own family? If he isn't the killer, who is? The serie deals with the prejudice someone can receive simply for having a mental disorder. It also deals wonderfully with the dilemma of the protagonist's wife Cha Ji Won: should I keep feigning ignorance to keep my family intact and protect my daughter, or should I pursue the truth and risk losing everything if it turns out my husband is a murderer? Even if he isn't a murderer, he lied to me for 15 years, should I ignore that? Can I keep loving someone who is physically incapable to love me back, even though for all intents and purposes he has been the perfect loving husband and father?The actors play their respective parts incredibly well. Especially Lee Joon Gi (as Baek Hee Sung/Do Hyun Soo) deserves an applause for perfectly playing a man who is incapable of feeling most human emotion, but who is desperately playing a part to protect the life he lives. Especially his control over his facial muscles jumped out to me in one episode (I think it was episode 5?), I didn't even know it was possible to do that! He makes me feel sympathy for him - I am definitely rooting for him to get what he wants most! Also, the child actor who plays Baek Eun Ha, the couple's daughter, is surprisingly good at acting and immediately melts your heart - especially seeing her interactions with her father.In short: if you like suspense series with a little bit of romance, if you like being surprised with a twist every episode, if you enjoy stellar acting and good writing - this is the next series you definitely should put on your watchlist.",unknown,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,I have never given any rating for any drama though iv watch a lot of k-drama and a big fan too. But this is by far THE BEST drama ever i ve watched in recent years and i cant help but give a rating. Every epi is worth watching. THEY DESERVE ALL THE AWARDS.THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN LEE JOON GI AND MOON CHAE WON IS SOOO AMAZING.,positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"It was quite a gripping, holds-your-attention series. The only problem I had was with the psycho-killer son coming out of the coma and being active and as if nothing ever happened. If a person is coma that long >15 years, normally surgeons may intentionally cut tendons as the muscles atrophy; but I guess they did show a scene where his hospital bed is equipped with ""exercise"" sections. He looked way too healthy. They should have had him wake earlier and have a time progression of the parents getting him up and about. One minute he's just lying there on a ventilator and then he's in a wheelchair then bouncing around hunting people down. There were even a few moments when it was almost getting too over-the-top, he was overacting with the nutty glaring eyes and it could have been lessened. He was methodical in one scene then the next he's wild-eyed. Okay, a minor step back for me but it was alright overall.The story had a nice blend of characters...funny, nutty, devilish, romantic, sad, despondent - lots of supporting storylines.The ending: I thought he was going to die which would have pissed-off the viewers as it was a solid romantic story. We wanted the happy ending and got it! Kudos to the writers.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"The biggest problem was the too much stretch to end the series, which is the problem in almost all Korean dramas. The plot has too many similarities with previous dramas such as ""A Beautiful Mind 2016"". They don't give any reason as to why the Baek couple gives Dohyun Su their son's identity. However, the direction and romance was beautiful, which makes it appealing. I loved the character of Ji Won. The last episode was extremely unnecessary in its sudden shift to the-50-first-dates twist, such desperate stalling and shifting is very annoying.I think they should keep such dramas shorter up to 9 episodes, rather than having a fixed number of episodes as long as 16, which is too much.",neutral,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"This drama is just beyond expectations, a very new form of suspense, love, and thriller i have ever seen. The storyline, script, scenario, acting, cinematography and ....etc everything in this drama is breathing smartness, the writer is a genius woman. The main Actor Lee joon gi is a top notch actor. His acting deserves many awards national and international. He needs to take more similar roles because it makes his talent shine more. The actress is amazing too. I recommend this drama sooooo freaking badly. I felt like my time was put into a very beneficial and valuable thing. I didn't feel bored or dragged or anything of this kind. The drama was literally a freaking MASTERPIECE and i am not exaggerating. I give it 9/10...",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"The Good:The characters are all likable and easy on the eyes. Acting is all solid.The script is solid and has some genuine gasp-out-loud moments. Twists and turns abound.Some of the locations are nicely done; it's got a bit more variety than most crime kdramas.The two story romances are handled well. I don't care for romances and they managed to make them at least watchable. The four characters involved on the romance side all had good chemistry.The little girl deserves a tv award; she might have been one of the best actors in the show.The Bad:The music is bombastic and overdone. Characters can't do so much as take a dump without an orchestra belting out Carmina Burana like it's a lightsaber duel.The show is filled with typical garbage decision-making by all the characters; they all withhold information to create extra drama, and it gets frustrating and irritating by the time you're down to the last few episodes. There's about 50% real drama and 50% manufactured drama in this show.Nobody in this show EVER answers a direct question. They always shoot another question back. It's the most irritating thing ever.Nobody can have a conversation without it taking 10 minutes and devolving into tearjerking music. Every scene tries to be a cliffhanger. I haven't seen this much overt audience manipulation since watching American soap operas. It's kdramas like this that draw the comparison to soap operas.It's a pretty decent show. It really is. But it's really not up to the standards of other serious kdramas. It's just too overdone. I'd have given it an 8 but the soapiness and melodrama just drags it all down.And of course the last episode is as bad as everyone said it would be, although it does at least end on a sort of happy note.You know what this show needs? A remake.It's a solid story with good characters, and it needs to be remade FOR grown-ups BY grown-ups. I'm so frustrated because I really wanted to love this show, but it's straight-up embarrassing filmmaking.",negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"The series is about false identities, human trafficking and serial murder. In itself it is entertaining and the parts are well played. Especially Moon Chae-Won put down (as detective Cha) a character that can be funny, sweet and determined. She is a pleasure to watch. Choi Young-Joon (as detective Choi) is also well cast, as is the reporter Kim Ji Moon. But for following the plot you have to prepare to drift far off from reality. The two awakenings from coma to full cognition are too unlikely. Especially when one person suddenly awakes after 10 years of coma, goes through a speedy rehabilitation to the point of getting up from a wheelchair, runs after a person that he then engages with in a fight and later on turns into a formidable fighter to a point of disarming a police officer.The main character, played by Lee Joon-Gi gives almost everything, including a bag of money and almost his life to obtain some evidence from a big criminal. When the criminal is finally floored he leaves without taking this evidence from the criminal's pocket. Nor does the police when he is arrested. The criminal is then left under the guard of just one policeman with the key to the handcuff hanging from his breast pocket. A couple escapes without anything and later shows up in a hotel suite with a large miraculously present laptop. And it goes on like this.The series actually ends with the 15th episode. The final episode is sentimental crap that adds nothing to the story and is exquisitely boring.",negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,"This 16-episode series with 60+ minutes in each episode is a real gem due to the superb acting, screenplay, cinematography, and directing.Baek Hee-sung is actually Do Hyun-soo, the son of a serial killer who took the blame for his sister's killing in self-defense and ran away, being now sought for murder. Adrift for awhile, he is accidentally run over by his father's accomplice, Baek Hee-sung, who tries to bury the still breathing Hyun-soo when his mother surprises him in the act. She stabs her murderous son and both parents decide to have the recovered Hyun-soo take the place of Baek Hee-sung, while the real Baek Hee-sung lies hidden in a coma.The new Baek Hee-sung meets headstrong Cha Ji-won, who woos him until they marry.Fast forward about 14 years. Hee-sung and Ji-won, a police detective, have a daughter and live in a house with a metal workshop, where Hee-sung crafts jewelry. Hee-sung works hard at playacting the happy husband, although he is a truly loving father to the daughter. His world comes to a crashing halt when he is recognized as the suspected killer Do Hyun-soo by a reporter and his wife takes on the cold murder case.The story commences with tragic twists, surprises, false leads, and mistakes, as reporter, detective-wife, the detective's team, Hee-sung's parents, the real Hee-sung (having woken from his coma), Hyun-soo's sister, a distraught taxi driver seeking his wife who was the last victim of Hyun-soo's murderous father, and of course Hyun-soo himself try to outsmart the other. Everyone is hiding something from the others, but the viewer knows what's going on for the most part.In the end, justice is served to the murder accomplice, but not before Hyun-soo is shot in the head and survives with amnesia, having returned in his memories to the fateful car accident from 15 years ago. He learns that he had been committing identity theft and no longer trusts himself to be a good guy (he never trusted himself before but had learned to truly love his wife thanks to her nearly unwavering support for him during the hunt-and-chase ordeal). His wife is distraught, but finally decides to let him go. That's when he realizes that he may be able to rekindle his feelings for her, but this time as a genuine person who doesn't have to playact anymore.That's why the amnesia is so important. It allows the story to make a clean cut between Hyun-soo's suffering as suspected murderer in hiding and phony husband and his new life as innocent victim of false accusations and even near-hero who has to learn to feel emotions for himself. We only see a glimpse of these new feelings in the end, with Ji-won, his wife, slowly accepting that maybe not all hope is lost to transition into a genuine loving marriage and family.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,"This show is amazing. You don't want to miss it.
Acting/ Cast- The main highlight of the show is it's actors. All of them an amazing job especially Lee Joon Gi and Moon Chae Won. Lee Joon Gi as usual aces his role effortlessly. He emotes everything so perfectly that it captivates you to the scene. He has portrayed extremes of emotions in a single person in this show and he did this very convincingly. The control he has on his expressions and body language is marvellous. Those subtle changes he showed were beyond someone's imagination. Moon Chae Won was a really compatible female lead for the show. Her portrayal of Cha Ji Won is what the script demands. Since, there were not many dynamics of her character explored I was a bit disappointed. Nevertheless the actor filled Cha Ji Won's shoes pretty well.
Other actors also did a pretty amazing job. Eun Ha is a princess and with her father she has the best scenes of the series.
Screenplay/ Direction- Something I would say that held the show together were these things. Every episode was full of revelations and still there was so much more to offer in further episodes. I kept wondering after each episode that so much is already revealed, how are they going to make it to the end but they never let me down. Till the very end I never found it boring. Screenplay let me know, how most clichés can be turned into a masterpiece and the director made me understand how many dynamics of the emotions a character can have.
Story/ Plot- It is quite interesting. However there were a few loopholes according to me. It would have been better to cover them up but still, they were something you can ignore. Plot is unusual, as contradictory to the synopsis. He does have a past but you can never guess it from the beginning until it is revealed. You may make a few hits but the main catch of the past is very unusual.
It is a rollercoaster ride that one may not want to miss. I am sad, it ended. All in all it's a must watch.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,"Would've given a higher review but the last few episodes were hard to watch. I felt as though the writing got sloppy trying to warp the show, and in turn the characters devolved towards the end. It's a pity because I really liked until the end.",negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,I stopped at S7. Had fairly high hopes first 3 episodes and then it slowly started devolving into one impossible situation after another. Suspension of belief is always required to some degree in most shows and particularly K Dramas but this one simply requires you to live in and believe an alternate reality.I then started reading some of the spoiler reviews here to confirm my thought and felt relieved that I didn't waste any more of my time as they proved a level of fantasy involved in the script that puts to shame a good manga.Don't waste your precious time. This is a pure soap opera of the worst kind.,negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"I'll be honest, I'm not interested in crime thrillers, I much prefer romance dramas but I watched this purely because of Lee Joon-Gi (the lead actor). I watched him in Moon Lovers the week before and was mesmerised so I wanted to see more of him and support his projects. Well, if you're like me and hoping to find Prince Wang So in here then don't watch this. There is no chivalrous, cool, calm, overly handsome, deeply in love Prince... but there is an apathetic psychopath that still gets you hooked.DEFINTELY WATCH THIS IF YOU WANT TO SEE GREAT ACTING FROM LEE JOON GI.He also plays a loving husband and doting father which takes him to another level of hotness.The storyline is gripping! I'm usually good at guessing the outcome but even i was blind-sided many times. The amount of twists in this series is out of control. In my opinion, the writers should have left out the last twist so it could have been a much happier and satisfying ending (and I would've given it a 10 star rating).Therr were a couple of touching scenes were not so touching, felt a little overacting...like when they hug and cry, I felt like they were over-hugging and over-crying, however it's completely forgiven because I'm obsessed with Lee Joon Gi.Overall, a very riveting series that will keep you on edge, you will enjoy it if you're into crime/suspense thrillers (think The Bone Collector style). Not as addictive as Moon Lovers if you're into Romance however a must watch if you want to see kissing scenes from Lee Joon Gi and imagine him as a hubby.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

However, to tack onto this fine series the tired, outdated amnesia trope KDrama writers have been guilty of for 20 years and most fans loathe was not only a mistake, but a decision that ruined the closure of this series. Where the writer had a chance to take the story even higher into the themes of the power of love and family to defeat greed, madness, and cruelty, the writer lost inspiration and for me ruined the ending.

The presence of some comic scenes especially with the reporter kim moo jin.The - :
To me, the main flaw was the story and how the characters are portrayed.

tt11691684,"Interesting plot, but it falls flat. I didn't manage to finish the show. Ok here goes...
Well, like every other kdramas out there, the tension builds and builds and then it falls apart faster than a speed off light in a vacuum. I'm talking about the scene where he is in the apartment and the wife suddenly comes. Then he's hanging outside the building and she's about to open the curtain. Ya, they really slowed down the scene with dramatic music and she's about to open the curtain and expose him. Buttttttt this is kdrama; it doesn't have the balls. So, she just moves on.
And oh another thing with k drama is they try to implicate a character incredibly villainous/evil/murderer only to uno reverse everything. Oh ya, that's usually a sign the character is in fact innocent and I, the viewer, am wrong even though I have been led thoroughly to believe otherwise. So EVENTHOUGH I have quit the series, I bet you my bottom dollar that the husband is innocent like super-duper innocent, and he has nothing to do with the crime. At all.

tt11691684,"Korean thrillers hit such a high standard. The plotting is labyrinthine, filling many hours of character driven action, each climax surpassed by the next until the final denouement. It's remarkable how they achieve this so very consistently.This is no exception. The opening episodes appeared all too obvious, with an out-and-out baddie seemingly about to deliver to our worst expectations. But then the twists and turns begin and the surprises mount until we have a very different plot to the one that had been signposted. If that's all a bit vague, I don't want to give anything away.Edge of your seat stuff. Don't miss it!",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,"I find Flower of Evil to be second only to The Glory, truly one of the best of the Korean series out there. It is incredibly detailed in the arcs of the story, the misdirection, the red herrings and keeps you guessing. Maybe it didn't need to be so long in scope but perhaps the creator and writers thought it the best way to tell the story about real family, duplicitous family and just being human.I take a point off for the very annoying music. It is almost like watching a Douglas Sirk film and it is absolutely not needed. Why not just depend on your extremely capable cast and the writing, set pieces, which are great. I do not understand this soapy, awful romantic music swelling up, threatening to swallow intimate and emotional moments.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,"Thrillers, Mystery and crime shows are my kind of thing. I think I have watched so many of this genre that I could always guess whodunit. I am always excited to watch these type of shows. Flower of evil was quite interesting at first. It had a nice atmosphere and storyline. I was so into it up until the last few episodes. The overly dramatic scenes ruined it for me. It was just unnecessary and felt so contrived. I guess the writers wanted the audience to sympathize with the lead actors so badly. They were trying too hard! I know this is a melodrama but some of the scenes didn't go well with the initial vibe of this show. It didn't flow smoothly with this crime, whodunnit plot. The writing got lazy and it feels like they just threw all this heavy, crying scenes out of nowhere. This could have been one of my favorite asian mystery thriller. If only the writers were just consistent.",negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

The story-writing is terrific and very fast paced. The story is somewhat complicated but realistic and it gets clearer and clearer as the series go on but it's unpredictable.

tt11691684,"IN SHORT:
It's an amazing humane drama with an incredibly beautiful narrative. The dialogues are so well versed they hit right into the heart! The quiet heartwarming background piano (sometimes violin mixed too) makes the past flashbacks scenes very alluring and majestic. Those first scenes (the flashbacks) are one of my top favorite bits of each episode!The production was the definition of perfection till the drama's last breath! Kudos to Directors, Screenwriters, Composers and Actors, especially our beloved Moon Chae Won and LEE JOON GI. They did an outstanding job bringing the characters to life, Do Hyun Su's character was an especially hard one to pull, he truly deserves much love!IN LENGTH:
The story takes it's time to develop the characters in the first few episodes, and the situation quickly escalates! You'll be surprised how much you're invested by the time the tragic strings of events begin!The plot is about one man who wants to find the meaning of happiness for once, after dress rehearsing tragedy, in his entire life before! And a woman who wants such happiness for the man she is head over heels in love with!After turning over his life, 18 years later in the present, he is pretty much what a perfect husband is expected to be! Doing too well to say! Everything is about to get ruined by a sudden turn of event that leads to uncovering his past! which seems to be filled up with misfortunes in more than one way!The drama takes it's time to develop the main characters in present, while hinting about what could have happened in the past without giving too much spoiler early to fuel our adrenaline secretion, then suddenly we are thrown back to the past to only realize what actually is important is not what we were looking forward to the most! It's a whole different disheartening story that takes a creative take on self-inflicted misery, taking blame, and finding a middle ground for one's well being and happiness!Acting is top notch! Lee Joon Gi as Baek Hee Seong is top notch! He looks totally dependable, manly and more than anything, a lovely dad! Whereas portraying Do Hyun Su couldn't be better executed! He looks so much younger now, and has a gaze that says the world about him, adorable and painfully cool in his yellow hair style!Moon Chae Won is doing wonder with her acting! She has the kind of shaky, mellow voice that has emotions breathing out while she talks! She is an amazing actress who wonderfully fills the role of a very caring strong woman, Cha Ji Won, seeking happiness above all else for her family! She looks beautiful and mature, it's always great to see her again in a new drama!I'm just gonna say! the music is just too perfect! From the incredibly suspenseful tracks ""Flower of Evil"" and ""Switched Destiny"" to the melo tracks ""Upcoming Shadow"" ""Hard Relationship"" to my most favorite track in this album ""Cherry Blossom Kiss"" which starts weird, mysterious and full of anxiety and emptiness, then it paces up to a sweeter tone then a more joyful and bright tone, which goes perfectly with Do Hyun Soo's character journey within the dramaWe also have the feel nostalgic poetic piano track ""Someone to Be Remembered"" by Jung Se Rin (I noticed he has also composed the unbelievably beautiful track ""When Mind Wants to Rest"" from Naui Ahjussi)There are only three songs on the entire album. (One of them ""Psycho"" by DOKO, being used only as an ending theme for the episodes and it's very catchy and goes well with the epic clifhangers.)I have to say the remaining two are the most beautiful songs released in a drama this year! They aren't ever overused and it only plays when you really start to crave a song! They have that kinda impact!""Feel You"" by Shin Yong Jae is one of those two songs and it really deserves all the awards! Mark my words! An unexpressed love confession with lyrics beautifully wording out the feelings he has no idea sorting out for himself!
The melody is especially sad yet thrilling and makes our heart skipping beats! You can't tell what it exactly makes you feel, probably to reflect how Hyun Su can't distinguish between his own emotions, even in those moments his heart races like he is in pain!""In My Heart"" by LIM YEON is also a wonderful love poem, describing what Ji Won is feeling towards Hyun Su, and how even if her heart comes crashing down, she will face it, as long as it's love, she will be there, for her love!I would probably re-watch this drama many times! It's that good. Tho the mystery element will be gone, it still has lots of suspense and drama to enjoy.Highly recommended for fans of psychological thrillers and those who enjoy subtle romance plot-lines! A Must Watch Definitely.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"This drama surpassed all others in everything. Perfect script. The story grips you and the performances are perfect. I confess that I accepted to watch it due to some comments I had seen, but I'm glad my sister convinced me. Totally out of the cliché. He doesn't make us fond of psychopaths or romanticize them. The plot that is created in the face of this series of murders is dense and full of tension. It's something incredible for us to think about the tireless internet courts that easily judged based on a sentence or something like that... It shows us that we shouldn't judge anything or anyone for guesswork (it's enough for Moro who condemns without having proof, but as intended). Jin-won is about to show us how to behave in front of something that will be judged, best detective ever! Best drama ever. When it seems impossible for Joon-gi to break his own acting record, he goes out and does it.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"I watched this masterpiece which is one of the very few shows that actually deserved 16 episodes without a single dull moment.Both leads were fantastic in it, especially their chemistry and their love and affection made me cry on several occasions. Lee Joon Gi take a bow. No wonder you are one of the best Korean actors.Please make more great shows like this. I recommended it to two friends one of whom has praised this show so much.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"I can't stop thinking about this show! Nothing is what it seems! The show moves at a fast pace while constantly throwing curveballs at you. Right up until the end you question everything you think you know about the story. The acting was superb! What a cast! I'm definitely gonna watch this show again once my heart has healed and my brain has stopped spinning LOL I was physically tense the whole time! I had to remind myself to breathe. I pretty much had anxiety attacks along with Hyun Su :DI really like to dive deep into characters' mindsets and psychological states and this show has certainly given me a lot to mull over. So here we go! Spoilers all around, beware!First of all - Do Hyun Su. I don't think he is a sociopath like he is portrayed. He is considered to be on the antisocial spectrum but I disagree - he believes this because the entire village made him think that. I think that after all those years of being told he's a psycho like his dad he convinced himself that he really had no emotions. He is very emotionally stunted and deeply traumatized but he really is capable of love, he just doesn't know it. The way he treats his daughter is proof he really loves. He also really loves his wife. When he stood outside the dark store to keep her safe in the blackout! OMG The fact that he lied about his identity to his wife is troubling but I understand given the circumstances. I don't understand why he kept Moo Jin captive for the first couple episodes but he never really wanted to kill him. In a real life scenario I would never encourage anyone to give him as many chances as Ji Won did - never insist on loving a man that tells you they don't love you!! But in the show it means that she could see that he really had love inside him and didn't know it. Also, he sacrificed himself to save his sister, and if that isn't love, I don't know what is.I didn't know what to think of Moo Jin at first because it seems like he's trying to expose Hyun Su? Then he's helping him. And his neverending love for Do Hae Su <3 Also, Eun-ha is freaking adorable! Every time she she said uppa! I cried like a baby.Baek Hee sung - dude, I get genuinely scared when he gets that demented look in his eyes! And Do Min Seok with his black eyes is pretty much nightmare material right there. Goosebumps every time he is on screen just standing there silently. Crap! The story comes full circle when you realize that the boys ""switched"" fathers. Do Min Seok ""adopts"" Hee Sung because his own son is not a psycho like him. And then Hee Sung's father ""adopts"" Hyun Su to cover up what happened. Corrupt parents everywhere, sheesh. I kind of feel bad for the mom because she stabbed her son bc of what he did but her husband wanted to cover it up. I think her initial coldness/hatred is due to trauma and guilt. The father, though, he just ended up crazy? I wish he had ended up sane and in prison.I think they forgot to let Hyun Su know that Hee Sung killed/betrayed his father. Right? That girl who was missing (I forgot her name) saw what happened and she never told anyone. It pissed me off that she ended up getting abducted by the bad guys TWICE. But I loved it when she held Hyun Su back from killing Hee Sung.The human trafficking scenario is super scary and REAL and breaks my heart that this goes on everywhere.I was SUPER mad in the last 2 episodes because Hyun Su reverts back into his emotionless self and starts to believe again he is that sociopath he was gaslighted into believing. I can understand him, though - he forgot 15 years (bullcrap, because amnesia doesn't work like that - you only temporarilty forget the time around the trauma, in this case, the head wound) of his life, so he ""forgot"" that he is capable of love. And he didn't want to lead Ji Won on because he wanted to do the right thing. I was ready to break something if they didn't end up together! LOLWhoooo what a ride. What a ride! This show lives rent free in my head now. I can't wait to watch it again.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"This is an excellent Korean film with superb filming, beautiful locations. The series as in most Korean films include too many episodes to keep complete following logically. There is also overacting at all of the emotional parts and just packed with excessive sentimentality. A US audience will have trouble taking the emotional side that is frequently on display. Excluding the excessive sentimentality the plot was exciting and it drew in your interest. The actors are are such that you can relate to them in a very real way. It also did have it's exciting moments to keep it from feeling love kena soap opera. Overall a good series and worth the watch.",neutral,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,Good story but the emotional scenes are too dragging at times.,neutral,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,""" Flower of Evil "" was a pretty intense drama. What is spot on about it, is how they managed the characters. At first, the viewer is introduced to the main male lead, who is presented as a serial killer, psychopath, and unable to feel emotions, especially empathy, while he uses his wife in order to hide who he is. Eventually, the story deepens into what really happened, who really is the male lead, and how he feels and acts.The serial killer case gets the same roller coaster treatment, though an experienced viewer might have a few right guesses as to who is the real murderer. The addition of the family drama, with the in-depth presentation of all characters and their stories, especially the journalist and the sister, were all a nice touch and enriched the suspense and the emotional impact of the story.However, there were a few moments, especially towards the ending, when the drama felt like it repeated some patterns. The female lead was endearing more than enough times, as she was presented more childish when it came to her feelings and how she expressed them. That said, the performances from everyone in the cast were brilliant and helped a lot to the success of the drama.The ending, finally, was dangerously tiptoeing around the limits of cliche trop, but they handled it nicely enough to never actually reaching it.So, overall, seven out of ten.",neutral,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

tt11691684,"Let's not talk about the last episode and think of it as a mishap. Ending is still satisfying, so.A thousand stars. This is, like someone else wrote, the best show I've ever seen, Korean or otherwise. Maybe not the best, actually, but I can't think of another number one right now. It's pure perfection.I didn't dare to blink, lest I might miss something.Seriously, there wasn't a single useless scene, a single boring part. At the beginning, as things seemed to happen so fast, with secrets unraveling twice an episode, I wondered how they would manage to keep me interested for the rest the show. Oh they did. Beautifully, unexpectedly.I have been a fan of LJG since Scarlet Hearts, and looking for him. I think his face is quite peculiar. He looks like a fox or a wolf who wrenched off a human face and streched it over his own. Creepy yet fascinating, deadly attractive. No wonder he was chosen to play a vampire, and then a scarred prince.Hence, this role was made for him. I'm sure no other actor could have pulled this so brillantly. The way he uses that uncanny face of his to emulate fake emotions is truly a wonder to behold.All the other actors came up with great, impressive performances. The wife's unconditionnal love was so impossible, yet I still bought it.Everything was perfect. Scenery, pace, pathos, romance, thrill. I loved this drama to bits. Thank you so much, all of you who worked so hard. This is indeed a Masterpiece. I'll introduce people to it.",positive,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,"This drama piqued my interest initially with its mystery / thriller pitch as a cat-and-mouse game between a suspected serial killer and his wife who is a detective. Little did I know that it had so, so much more to offer. I was gripping my seat watching it from all the twists and turns, but even more so, the laughter and the tears!

Padding 4 or 5 episode is already drag, but doing so after already reaching an endpoint only to twist and turn again was tedious. We binged the first 6 or so episodes, only to have it crawl from episodes 12 through 15.Good acting all around (except Nam Gi ae as Hee Sung's mother. Not terrible but not quite up to par with the rest of the cast) and a great start and satisfying conclusion still don't save this completely.6.4/10, C.",negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"
tt11691684,This drama has a really great storyline and is the only reason I managed to finish the whole show. This is the first time in all the shows and movies I have ever watched where I was unable to connect to even 1 character......accept maybe the reporter friend. Even the wife and husband duo had zero chemistry. And the constant crying every episode was wayyyyyyyy too much. I'm not sure if it's the character or the actor but the main lead was as dull as a rock. He actually made the show a struggle for me to finish watching. Like I said the storyline is good but went on for too long. It started dragging midway through the series. All in all this show was not enjoyable for me sadly.,negative,"Crime, Mystery, Romance"

Sometimes in dramas the crying can be a bit over the top but the actors/actresses displayed their emotions genuinely and honestly. The supporting members of the cast were also characters you grew to love hate and I personally would not change any of the actors/actresses in their roles.

tt11691684,"THE FLOWER OF EVIL. (2020) This was such a great show and such a fascinating, compelling story. Having a whole cast of wonderful characters, preformed by great actors and actresses, as well as great music OST and visual cinematography, made it an excellent experience. It is unforgettable and definitely a rewatchable, thrilling show. It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions from start to finish, and the ending had me choked up. It definitely packs a punch.Baek Hee Sung/ Do Hyun-soo (Lee Joon Gi) is a man who hides his identity and past from his wife Cha Ji Won (Moon Chae Won), a detective. On the surface, they appear to be the perfect family: a loving couple with a beautiful daughter who adores her parents. Cha Ji Won and her colleagues begin investigating a series of unexplained murders and is confronted with the reality that her seemingly perfect husband may be hiding something from her.First of all, Lee Joon Gi (Baek Hee Sung) and Moon Chae Won (Cha Ji Won) were fantastic in their roles and made the series so believable. Both are superb actors and had such excellent on-screen chemistry, even though this isn't really a romantic drama, their relationship is a key theme throughout. The entire cast was fantastic, even Jang Hee-jin (as Do Hae-soo) and Seo Hyun-woo (as Kim Moo-jin). I found Kim Moo-Jin such a funny, lovable character. Also, the police/detective team were great as well. Also, wow, what an incredible and absolutely adorable child actress Jung Seo-yeon as Baek Eun-ha, is (daughter of Hee-sung and Ji-won)! She was just the cutest, especially when interacting with her father. She lights up every scene that she is in.Overall, this show is a highly complex story with layers of mystery, dark psychological aspects, intensely thrilling moments, dark secrets of the past coming back to haunt, full of twists and turns and a complete emotional rollercoaster ride that leaves you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The series did such an excellent job of balancing the fine line of being both tender and gritty, beautiful and yet dark. Highly entertaining and beautiful to watch, thought-provoking, memorable and just an overall fantastic series. LOVED IT. (Hoping for a Season 2!)STORY: 10/10

tt11691684,"I have never watched let alone reviewed Korean drama series before, but I always heard impressive things about Korean talent and its provocative content.Flower of Evil is really interesting and full of gripping plot. I will have to admit that its somewhat rare to be able to find a series with a determined plot that
actually carries a lot of weight, intensity driven by emotions, sacrifice, love etc.The two leads did a really great job in terms of standing up for their love even through hard times and inspire people about how you fight for someone you love and accept all of their flaws.Even though few elements seem like redundant at certain times, the immediate ensuing plot has the potential to take back the attention of viewers. I for one can vouch for that.Overall, with a powerful and original story like this, I don't see any reason for this series to be unlikable.

The action sequences are done superbly and Han So Hee did a tremendous job with her part.Clocking at only 8 episodes, My Name is shorter than other K Dramas, but it is definitely filled with amazing action and outstanding OST. It felt like every beat matched perfectly with the given scene, which made the overall show compelling and worth watching.This Netflix original was good for its story, the attractive OST, the great casting along with commendable performance by Han So Hee, amazingly shot sequences with more than decent fight/action sequences and an overall violent atmospheric setting.My Rating : 9/10.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt12940504,"As this series opens school girl Yoon Ji-woo is hassled by the police and bullied by schoolmates because her estranged father is working in a major drug dealing operation. On her birthday he returns home but is gunned down in front of her by an unidentifiably assassin. Determined to find and kill the man responsible she approaches the only person who might help; her father's associate, crime boss Choi Moo-jin. He takes her in and she trains in martial arts in the gang's training school; here she does well but makes an enemy of a fellow student. Choi Moo-jin has her declared dead then, under a new name, she enters the police as a spy. He gives her a clue to the identity of the killer; a discarded police issue pistol. As the years progress she advances and ultimately gets assigned to the drug squad. This gets her closer to the suspected killer; it also puts her in the investigation into Choi Moo-jin's activities and face to face with somebody who might expose her true identity.I really enjoyed this South Korean series. The plot and general feel were more movie like than televisual... perhaps this is because key plot elements reminded me of the Hong Kong 'Infernal Affairs' trilogy. The story delivers plenty of impressive, sometimes bone-crunching, action as well as twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing as to the identity of the killer. Our protagonist gets into many scrapes and there is a real sense of danger; she certainly isn't immune to injury. The cast does a really fine job; especially Han So-hee who excels as Ji-woo. She manages to make scenes of a diminutive woman defeating several men believable. I liked the fact that the series is morally ambiguous; most viewers will be highly sympathetic to Ji-woo even though she is part of a criminal gang; even her boss is sympathetic to a degree... of course it helps that we are invited to suspect certain members of the police and there is a more unpleasant gangster to treat as a main villain. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre; it is top notch.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt12940504,"Korean cinema does better action, crime than many industries. It should be a common knowledge by now. Even some of their bad ones have great action choreography and set pieces. With popularity of Squid Game and Parasite winning an Oscar, I would've thought lot more people would be interested in their content like k-pop and kdrama has huge following. Sadly this one isn't getting as many views as it deserves.It's a well acted, well written and directed thriller that is shaded because Netflix isn't promoting it enough and people are still not over the whole drama over who will watch with subtitles.The action is brutal, with sprinkles of gore. It's well shot and edited. Some of the stunts are novel and the lead actress can M O V E. Best thing about this season (and I doubt there will be another) is that there aren't many padding or fillers. Some flashbacks, forgivable cliches and plotholes aside the writing really works. There are enough twists and turns. The bad guys have motivation that make sense and not just pure evil.Special mention to the original soundtrack and background score. Couple of them are cardio worthy. Another special mention to the action choreography which is done in a way that feels like a sub-practical fight and not clean martial arts.Spread the word, recommend it to your friends.

Her acting here is totally convincing and so different in this action role. Not many actresses can switch from makjang drama to romance to action so well. Even if there was clever stunt use or camera work the action sequences are quite breathtakingly exciting. And she deserves an award for her effort.The violence is more than usual for K drama action. The basic story isn't complicated and the tone is consistent. Because it is an 8 episode show there isn't the drag some 16 episode shows have. It's a neatly complete story about drugs gangs and cops.

tt12940504,"""Because you need conviction in order to kill someone""South Korean cinema is particularly good at having amazing revenge thriller drama. Two of most prolific examples are I Saw the Devil and Oldboy. Because of this, I wanted to see if this revenge thriller show on Netflix could bring any thing new to the plate.The first three episodes were a bit slow that set up the mystery and the quest from our young female lead who followed a gang to find her dad's killer.Then middle three episodes of this show were the best part because this was the chase between the police and the drug lord, and our lead was in the middle of this whole shenanigan. It's interesting because in the middle of the thriller was the mystery that kept building up. You suspected a person to be the killer but you are not 100% sure, and you also suspect this person could also be one.Sadly, after the twist, the last two episodes slowed down and became predictable. There's a romance that I knew was going to happen way back, but it felt rushed and I already knew what was going to happen next. Because of this, I was pretty bored and disappointed with the ending.Overall, even though the ending didn't land well, it was still a good thriller. 7/10.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

However, the story gets predictable quite quickly. The timeline, also, was not handled that great, something that applies to the dream scenes as well.The drama actually needed more time to be properly developed, as the short length meant a rushed progress of the story as well. Still, the atmosphere was there and the action scenes were masterfully executed.

tt12940504,"Review By Kamal KDark, suspenseful, violence and heartbreaking, ""My Name"" tells a story of a woman who lost her father and then she chose to lose herself in order to take revenge.""My Name"" is an action thriller with the revenge trope as a main theme so the story doesn't have much depth and it's somehow predictable but overall, the drama is entertaining. It has many good action scenes and the choreographed fights are very well executed. The gore is also very realistic so trigger-warning: ""My Name"" has extreme violence that may not be suitable for everyone.The story is also well written and it doesn't lose its interest. The pace is good, not too slow nor too fast and it can be binged-watched easily. The length of 8 episodes is good enough to tell the whole story without leaving anything untold and without making the viewers bored or tired of it.Yoon Ji Woo has a powerful spirit within an unpowerful body which she eventually manages to build up after living, or better surviving, in a very brutal environment. She is indeed a very dynamic woman who doesn't let anything or anyone keep her away from her goal, revenge. Seeing her journey through Han so Hee's surprisingly good portrayal was satisfying and thrilling.Set aside the moral issue of the illegal stuff Choi Mujin does, I do think he is a pretty decent character. He has a very strong sense of loyalty hence any betrayal really must have cut deep. Props to the actor for being able to show his conflicting emotions upon knowing of the betrayal.In my opinion, even with the betrayal he still showed mercy to Donghoon despite their apparent one sided brotherhood. It's a given that death is for the traitor and since the betrayal is personal, the more reason he has to lash out. And yet the way he dealt with Donghoon was more with sadness and disappointment rather than revenge and anger. You can see the pain in his eyes when he shot him. Remember when Taeju said Mujin likes to torture his victims and watch life slowly drain from them, but with Donghoon he simply walked away as if he couldn't bear seeing him. If he wanted to torture Donghoon, he could have also then and there killed Jiwoo and made him watch (considering how desperate Donghoon was to protect her daughter).Overall, I loved the fighting, the connection between Ji Woo and Moo Jin and their dynamics, the visual aspects of the show and the performance. The writing could be a bit more polished - cut some parts out, develop some more. Would recommend it if you feel like watching an action flick and want to be entertained.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt12940504,"I liked this so very much. Not because I'm a fan of mob movies. Not because I like gore, in fact, I generally shy away from blood and excessive violence.But this series' story was so compelling, well done, and scripted, that I was sucked in. Especially, since it avoids the failings of so many other Korean series out there. Namely:1. It moves along with regular speed, avoiding unnecessary plot deviations or slow-downs that plague other dramas. And it avoids flash forwards that gloss over events simply because the writers are too lazy to figure out how to work them into the plot.2. The escape scenes are plausible. I wouldn't say probable, but in most of them, it is plausible that the bad guy (or good guy) can get away. Unlike A Wonderful Sight (Inspector Koo) with its buffoonery antics of folks slipping and falling like every surface in Korea was made of banana peels.3. And no reliance on improbable chance encounters or events to move the plot along. I did deduct one point for a scene (you'll know which one), that if it doesn't happen, the last episode and a half become impossible.Well acted. Actually VERY well acted! With superb fight scenes that don't rely on inhuman strength in a female character. Rather her skill, speed, agility, and wits cause her to be an arse-kicking machine.Great show.

But when the re-telling of a similar concept is executed well, it is an absolute joy to watch it. It has a gritty storytelling infused with an incredible cast performances, all of the cast I mean every single actor no matter the screen-time they have given has done an amazing work.The direction: The camera captured the action choreography in a seamless way. It's crazy to know that some shots were one-shot.Han So Hee: I was literally in awe by her acting. My God she pulled off every action scene with her soul.

It's a revenge drama and whilst the plot is very similar to the 2017 South Korean film ""The Villainess"" (where John Wick Parabellum's iconic motorcycle scene was inspired from, btw), My Name transcends with its stable phasing - no boring parts, just pure elite acting and action scenes throughout, well-choreographed gory combat sequences, impressive camera work, very cool tailor-made soundtrack, and of course the stellar main cast. I simply cannot end this review without complimenting the stunning and badass main star of the series, Han So Hee, who makes 5'5 girl beating up ripped clan members so convincing lol.

tt12940504,"First up; Han So Hee is an amazing actress and she show her full range in the first episode which is one of the many reason that episode is so great. Most of the cast is good and the initial story, albeit cliche and overused, is good enough to suck you in. Music excellent, scenes and production value pretty good for TV. Fight scenes are mostly done gritty and great. I also like the progression of the show and where they want to take the story, I get the feeling the main writers know where they want to go and develop characters and episodes accordingly. The twists and turns of the show keep you guessing who the killer is which is sort of fun too.What I loved the most about this though is that this is not a clearcut good vs evil. This show is ambiguous comes to morals and although you feel for and follow the protagonist, she is not a hero. She is basically a criminal looking for revenge, so not really sunshine and rainbows.The negative is mainly the slow decline of the show. Step by step, episode by episode, the show is getting less good and finally reach a point in the end where you barely care anymore. It is subtle, but if you put the first episode next to the last episode you can see that there is a decline in everything from filming, to directing, to acting, to sets, to storytelling. Yes, the writers know what they want to do, but the show runners and the directors fail to deliver. There are also a lot of extras or side characters that could not act their way out of a closet, so although the main core actors are great the rest are not. I saw a lot of complaints about the tiny woman beating up men, and yea I can partly agree. With determination, training, and will you can do a lot of things others cannot and mostly I think it sold well. It is not like she does not bled or bruise. She get beaten up as much as she beat up others, with the ending as exception... horrible ending...For what it is this is pretty good. If you enjoy a revenge story rapped around a mystery deeply in-bedded in a criminal world with a protagonist out for blood, this might very well be for you. This is definitely one of the better TV shows of this kind I have seen in a long while so this is definitely not bad. However this is not a masterpiece or fantastic either. Basically a good watch if you have nothing else to do. 6/10.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Also, I get it that Ji Woo wanted revenge for her father's death, but Moo Jin wasn't his killer. That's what bugged me the most.I'm not saying Moo Jin shouldn't be punished, but I just feel like the drama didn't give us an answer of who this ""mysterious"" guy is. I wonder if Moo Jin even knew who killed her father. I also wouldn't think Moo Jin would've killed her father the way how he died. It just wasn't the way he killed his enemies.I pity Ji Woo's character.I wish there was an actual answer before Moo Jin and Pildo died.This is why I couldn't give it a 10/10.

Both male leads are compelling in their roles as well, and I admired them, too.However. There are plot holes such as no depiction of her police training and how she became a Detective. But most of all, the ending is cynical and cruel. Absolutely pointless within that plot and for that character, and I was left angry and broken-hearted.

tt12940504,"Little to no character development. Most of the characters are already fully developed and the only one with room to develop in character is Jiwoo/Hyejin. Every other character has already developed offscreen in the past. Examples of this are the majority of the main characters. Pildo is Jiwoo's partner in the Narcotics unit and he's a fully developed character already. He's a pretty generic cop superior/antagonistic protagonist. He's experienced and often butt heads with Jiwoo because there are sides of her that's shady but he is a good cop.Cha and Choi Mujin are the most interesting characters imo and to no surprise, they are very important links to finding the answers Jiwoo is looking for. Both of these characters also don't really go through much character development.Basically this show doesn't try to do anything special and is aware of what purpose it's serving. It is an action flick with a dark undertone. You're going to see some cringe scenes in which the main character is going to take on several men at the same time. They will inflict knife wounds on her which she will basically walk off the pain while some of the characters she dispatches will take one tiny knife slash or tiny hit to the leg and be incapacitated as unrealistically as WWE athletes struggling on the floor for several minutes after a strike.However, there are also amazing scenes like when Mujin trains with Jiwoo at the gym on fighting and when Jiwoo shows the Narcotics unit how capable she is when she's told to bring Mango out and the scenes are entertaining; these scenes aren't anything unpredictable but they are done in a single shot with a continuous action sequence meaning the whole shot had to be taken each time they messed up. Don't expect a masterpiece; this is a good solid show that you can binge and will most likely enjoy as a slower paced action flick. If you're expecting Squid Game level of writing and character development/foreshadowing, this is not the show. My Name doesn't try to do anything clever like that; it is upfront about what it brings to the table and does a good job at it.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

I think Han So-Hee clearly cemented her place as a top female actress in Korea. Park Hee-Soon and Kim Sang-Ho never disappoint. The problem was that we've all seen countless iterations of this story. It's just a question of is the person seeking revenge a male or female? Whose death set the main character on the path of vengeance? Who's the really villain? Does the end justify the mean? Etc., etc., etc. The show runners made sure not to miss out on any cliches. But yet, I tried to convince myself to like it. Hoping for a surprisingly refreshing ending. Then, in Ep. 8, the director could not resist the temptation to throw in a mid-city car chase/crash and a completely formulaic love/sex scene. By the end of the show, the sheer cliche overload was exhausting and I was simply happy that it finally came to a stop, albeit very predictable end. If you're a big fan of Han So-Hee, why not. For all others, you might want to invest 8 hrs of your life on something else.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt12940504,"The South Korean film industry has produced some of the world's favourite action-packed revenge dramas. The Vengeance trilogy is a personal favourite. Kim Jin-min's 'My Name' is no different.'My Name' starts with a regular college-going girl, Yoon Ji-woo, who lives alone and is being closely monitored by the cops as she is the daughter of a most wanted criminal. Harassed in college, she gets into a fight with the bullies and decides to drop school. On her birthday night, she receives a call from her fugitive dad and lets him know that he means nothing to her anymore since he decided to leave her alone. Song Joon Su, the girl's father, having lived a discreet double life, establishes the base of the storyline after he gets killed in his own doorstep when he arrived to visit his daughter. Bereaved and filled with vengeance, Yoon Ji-woo goes to impenetrable heights, from joining a criminal organisation to police force, and will stop at nothing to avenge her father's death.With violent, gory and well-acted hand-to-hand (baton-to-knife mostly) action sequences and unexpected twists and turns, 'My Name' is pretty fast-paced to keep you binge-watching without a single yawn. The dramatic parts are accompanied with a perfectly-fitting soft melancholic score composed by Swervy and Jeminn. The direction and camera work was out of my expectation; very well done. Although the show ends high on a ""you need to be a monster to kill a monster"" cliché, its worth a watch for the incredible performances and supreme action choreography.",,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Let's give lots of credit to the main lead actress who is just pure intense and real acting( for a change) she should definitely have won awards for this performance. The fighting scenes are breath taking and a lot more realistic than in the American action movies. Here you can actually see the characters getting hurt, feeling the pain of their injuries, and not like they were superheroes who get hurt and walk away like there was nothing( which happens all the time in movies like John wick) Even though I kind of predicted the story by the middle of the serie, it got me completely hooked I jus wanted to know what would happen at the end. And that was where the series let me down, not because the ending was sad or happy, and I don't want to give any spoilers, but because it was not well developed, like the writers lost creativity. I followed the characters for eight episodes and I think they deserved a more elaborated ending.

tt12940504,"Pros: The story has a decent concept and the acting is good. It was smart to put out all the episodes at once because the timing is fast paced so it helps to keep the story moving along. The FL does well enough with a script that calls for a lot of physicality, yet she's written as a one-note character with no variations in her mood. The ML is well suited to the role of an intense and violent crime boss. The eventual love interest of the FL serves his purpose well enough.Cons: Yet again they take a physically normal person and quickly turn them into a super fighter with super human skills and super human stamina and endurance, who can be beaten down, sliced and diced and just keeps getting up for more. In fact, most of the cast fits this bill. There is so much graphic violence it actually takes away from the story's impact. And it's guaranteed that the audience sees almost every bullet hit, every knife wound, and every machete slice. Every episode is filled with violence. Some characters are killed for no reason other every fight is apparently to the death while others survive unbelievably horrific wounds. More than once, if you can believe it.Overall, I couldn't give it more than 4 stars because we've seen this type of film before.

So-hee gives an excellent performance from the first episode, making Jiwoo feel like the most vulnerable woman in the world while also being the most indestructible force of nature to ever grace the organized crime scene.While there is emotion in every episode, it is the highly technical fight sequences in ""My Name"" that stand out. Expert choreography and sound design are complemented by very few editing cuts and almost no shaky-cam, which has ruined countless other action dramas.""My Name"" might not have an Oscar-worthy premise, but it doesn't have to.

What I was even more glad about was the female lead, Han So-hee.

tt12940504,"Not a bad show, but certainly not of the same quality as SQUID GAME or even BAD GUYS. The story is quite simplistic so even though there are only eight episodes it does feel like it drags a little in the middle with some senseless back-and-forth plotting. The main actress is sufficiently tough to convince in the action stakes but I found her cold when it came to empathising with her; the supporting cast are better. The action is really nicely choreographed throughout so I just wish there was more of it, although the last episode is certainly satisfying in that respect.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt12940504,"I give it 4 stars for the production value and for the first episode, but that's it. Beside the first episode this series has no soul, it's devoid of human emotions. Every character is robotic and cold. It lacks what made a show like The Sopranos or 24 great. Every gangster, every cop has a human element to his life, love, friendship, family and such. My name is strictly business and it gets boring quick. When you start dozing off, the producers remember that the one fight scene per episode might wake you up. By the second episode this series turned into an investigation drama. Since the dialogues are nothing to write home about, you are left with not much. And they picked the tiniest, sweetest face, least charismatic actress in Korea to play the leading role. She's like a glass full of ice cubes. Watch an episode of Nikita with Maggie Q to see what I mean. You will see what a tough female leading role is like. The third episode will be my last. I think people got excited about watching another Korean Netflix show after the success of the much more superior Squid Game and are very generous with this show, still high on the Squid Game fun, but My Name does not deserve the 8 stars it has on IMDb as I'm writing this.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

This series is good, but not one of South Korea's best. First of all, it is dubbed; which is never conducive to the best iteration of a foreign program. The story of a girl seeking her father's killer and joining the mob, and then going undercover in the police department is original and well done. My main issue is that I am not sure that 8 episodes were needed to tell this story. It does get better and the characters more comfortable as the show progresses. The fight scenes are not that well choreographed. It, like many Korea movies and programs, is filled corruption, crime, and character's whose morality may not always line up with their career choice. The main star, Han So-Hee, is very good as the tortured and confused daughter of the victim. The show has some violent and bloody moments. The music is highly mismatched-not sure it was original.

tt12940504,"The biggest strength of the show is its execution and the way the script has been narrated. From a Story perspective though; it's nothing but the same dish of traditional, contemporary styled revenge drama with some reinforced flavours and flairs. Make no mistake, even if it borrows the notion from the concurrent titles with similar themes, the demonstration here with a rather prominent undercurrent of sentiments seems to stand out anyway.Part of the credit must go to the department of Action and all the people who were vigorously involved in it. Major props to the Camera personnel too, as their decision to shoot most of the combats in a handheld manner, adds up the much-needed realism and grittiness. The Score on the other hand did well enough of itself to complement the remainder of the set-up as required. Albeit, some tracks got repeated over and over again!Speaking of repetition, I think that's where this show seems to have struggled the most. With eight episodes, each with close to an hour of runtime, it is quite obvious that the plot was pushed to the limit, stretched too thin; therefore numerous scenes felt elongated, the rhythm stalled without any significant reason. Thus, at times you do feel the screenplay coming to an unexpected halt. Although, you need not worry as it eventually picks up the momentum and more than makes up for its deficiencies through its impeccable set of actions and some great character developments.The name that comes to mind at the earliest is Han So-hee as ""Yoon Ji-woo/Oh Hyejin"". Whether it be the dramatic portions, or in those bloody battles; she had shown her mettle and outshone everybody else! Another name that I would like to mention is Hee-soon Park as Mu-jin Choi, the drug lord. There's some interesting dynamic between these two, The script demanded the two leads to be equally capable of putting a wide variety of emotions in their respective enactments as well as to look enough convincing while doing it. And guess what? They didn't disappoint, not at all! Nearly all the peak moments had either of these two.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

With a storyline that keeps you at the edge of the seat all the time supported with some amazing music in the background and good shots, these actors have made Ji-woo and Choi Mu-jin alive. Especially the choreography of the action scenes deserves brownie points.After having seen Han So hee in few dramas, I didn't expect the performance that she delivered in this one. Even Bo-hyun who appeared only intermittently left a rather permanent mark on whosever life he touched.If there's any watch that you can call utterly satisfying in all aspects, it is this.

tt13400006,"Another drama about Joseon period. I am not a huge fan of fantasy but I did watch this drama. The actress was superb and wonderful in this role very well suited to her skills. Her mannerism and antics were hilarious, jokes well delivered. However that where the plus review ends.Spoiler: The king is always in danger and someone in his council always wants to remove the king nothing new here. The hierarchy is a bit confusing as usual K dramas wait until the very end to explain the characters, however it's still not clear at the end. Too many side plots that are never finished, the series was way too long as there was a lot of unnecessary crying episodes, too many flashbacks which was not required, failed attempts at generating romance among minor characters. Seems as though the writers anted to extend the episodes but had no thoughts on how to add suitable content.Worth a watch just for the Queen's acting.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

tt13400006,"There is some good comedy to enjoy in this show. But the non comedic parts are boring. Body swap and time travel to Joseon has been done before. Here there is a combination which provides some enjoyable scenarios. This show could have been 4 episodes shorter. The parts with the political fighting and scheming by the clans is repetitive and tiresome. Anyone who has watched a palace based K drama would have seen these things before.The jokes are cute at first with the gender swap with the modern cooking and modern lingo. While there are funny one liners, some of the jokes are unfunny and juvenile.Lead actress Shin Hye Sun is very enthusiastic and does the physical aspects of the comedy well. Quite a tour de force. Her one liners are the best part. She looks prettier here than in her modern roles. Good to see Kim Jung Hyun do a completely different role from the loveable scoundrel in CLOY. He has a wide range of acting on display here from stony faced emperor to sword fighting action to comedy. Choi Jin Hyuk plays the modern day chef and the flashes to him are funny. More of the back and forth between eras would have been better to break the monotony.A good effort but would have been better at just 16 episodes.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"Just finished watching it.This is not the ending we deserved after this many hours. I can't see this as a happy ending, when the person who we've been following, watching grow, and falling in love with (along with the King), is switched with someone different, who we've only ever seen in flashbacks. Yes, she deserves a happy ending of her own, but this feels like she just stole it from the King and Bong Hwan. All the progress he made, all those connections, it's all gone. And we just get ""Present day Bong Hwan changed, and became a good person, who fixed a security camera and reported corruption."" That's it. That's his ""happy ending.""On a different note, I'm very happy for side couples. Lady Choi and Royal Chef are my favorite couple.I enjoyed how the show gave us various characters and changed how we felt about them.

Shin Hyu-sun as Kim So Yong/Mr. Queen is just incredible! She's perfect to the role. Undoubtly, the queen! Kim Jung-yun too as King Cheoljong is lovable as well. He radiates a good aura everytime he appears on the screen. He gives justice to his role as the well-mannered king, the mysterious swordman and the loving partner of the queen. Everytime these two main leads are together, they somehow sparkle and ignite. They have an awesome and very sweet chemistry despite the unconventional relationship they are in to. You can't help but love them.Some scenes may seem boring though, like the rivalry between the two «Queen Dowager» and the political agenda of the Royal advisers. However, each episode satisfies the viewer, craving for more until the final episode, the 20th.I do not have to give credits in detail to each in everyone who is involved in making this series.

There is nothing about this that requires you to be Korean to understand it.I could go on and on about this show. Now that I have finished it, I know I am going to have a hole in my heart for a while, missing these characters.If you have the chance to watch this, I cannot recommend it enough. It was so good.By the way, some people have posted things about the ending, and I was a little concerned going into it. Honestly, I have no idea what their issue is. The ending is great.

tt13400006,"While the series set out to explore the comedic possibilities of a modern soul trapped in a historical queen's body, the formula turned out to be very limited to spin it for a very long 20 episodes. I enjoyed its earlier episodes but it kept repeating the exact same gags with every single episode. How many times they repeated the same kitchen/cooking gags? I don't understand how they thought that would work. The cast size was limited as well, it could've definitely helped in coming up with new material. However, its biggest flaw was trying to add plot to its bare-bone formula. It's one of the rarest sights to see this level of shameless attempts. They didn't even know how to include it so they dedicated separate episodes for it in the middle parts while reallocating the comedy to different episodes separately, again. Cutting and editing it down into an 8 episodes package could've solved most of its issues. I wouldn't have rated it this high if it weren't for its set up, characters, and some of the gags.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

tt13400006,"It does exactly what it should do, that is, the entertainment that is the balance in the daily stress. It sounds bombastic, but very few productions manage to do that. It's mostly a comedy, less so in the last episodes when it almost succumbs to the kdrama template. However, it remains good until the end. I don't know how much was scripted and how much was unscripted, but it has everything. And a talented cast, with the gorgeous and well-known Shin Hye-Sun, in a complex role, played magnificently. Seol In-Ah, although she has a serious role, she is also wonderful. Surprisingly, even Kim Jung-Hyun saves us from the annoying make-up (in other productions) and manages to do a good role. The production is a fantasy genre and it is a comedy, that is how it should be taken. A good job, until the end, one of the shows worth seeing.

The actress really put herself out there, I actually believed her to be two different people and was very disappointed with the queen in the end for stealing Bong Hwan's thunder.The last 10 minutes of the show was a let down for me. I mean there were so many routes it could have followed. The king could have reincarnated as a girl in Bong Hwan's world and it would have been such a happy ending.I get the concept and message that was being conveyed but still, they could have done better.Regardless, a big thank you to the Mr Queen team for their outstanding performance and filling my life with glee for 20hrs+",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

I don't know why so many people liked this bland, repetitive, confusing show. The actors try their best but they have nothing to work with.The intrigue is nonexistent. The baddies and goodies are indistinguishable. The comic moments forced and childish. The romance is utterly uninteresting.I can only assume that this is one of several Korean gender-swap romcoms to cater for the suppressed LGBTQ+ community.

The drama is funny with the gender bender aspect, however it has the same typical kdrama plot of childhood trauma + love triangles + evil female second lead.If I am being honest the drama is totally carried by Shin Hyesun and the talent different between her and the two male leads and the other female lead is very prominent. She sets the bar high that the others fall flat at times. This is further validated by the lack of award nominations for the male leads. The king's character could have been better but most often he's dull if he's not present with Shin Hyesun.

I am a sucker for such a story!During the journey the mismatched couple took us on towards that ending they generated quite a lot of laughs.

The Chinese drama called Eternal Love has a similar plot but it's very different at the same time.I think the Chinese version has a better build up of focusing on the goals of the main character than this show.

tt13400006,"Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers actually watch the same show as I do.This series was the same as any other Joseon set drama I have ever seen.

The woman is to be married to the King the next day. The king is in love with another woman and plotting to overthrow the family of his new wife.He thinks that she has overheard him plotting this so he tries to kill her but fails.The story then runs along the familiar lines of royal females plotting to take over the throne - aided and abetted by various treacherous ministers.It is an awkward premise to have the FL attracted to the KIng - as usual Koreans love to dance around homosexuality and it makes for an uncomfortable device here.The acting? - well I found the King to be somewhat incapable of expressing any emotion facially and somewhat wooden in his performance.The FL - I think she overdid the masculine walk and habits for too long. The foul language was unnecessary and had no place in that era.Once again we have to drag cooking into the proceedings and it's getting tiresome now.The ending was as expected and somewhat childish in some respects.In conclusion it was about ten episodes too long and too derivative

The lack of acknowledgement of all the sacrifices that BH made and of his feelings for CJ and Vice versa was sickening. The king fell in love with Sobong's (Mainly BH's personality) and he Is left with a shell of this person who will never be the one he loved. It's like falling in love with one twin (the mischievous one, fun, crazy and eccentric one) and ending with the other twin. They kinda dumbed him down also in the end which is quite contradictory to his character throughout the series , he is very smart and perceptive and remembers every small detail BH ever said to him, as he said , he prides himself in being the one who knew and understood his eccentric wife the best, so how come in the end, he doesn't seem to realize the person he truly loved is gone? From the way SB used to call him affectuously ""cheoljongie"" or ""Jong ah"" to SY's annoying high pitched voice ""Cheona"" there is a huge difference. Matter of facts, Soyong is not also that different of the Hwa Jin of the beginning because she is pretending to be someone she is not and taking credit for everything BH did which seems quite upsetting and disappointing coming from her who made the same reproach to Hwa Jin beforehand. In the end, the main protagonist of the love story got relegated to being a Second Lead or the Third wheel and that's what made is so heartbreaking. SB and CJ got that understanding and love that SY and CJ will never get and I don't care how many times people will try to convince me that they fell in love on first sight (which is absolutely false) in the epilogue.

I was curious to see what it was and why it was doing so good.I definitely agree with the praises this drama is receiving. I've never had a show make me this happy before: it makes me laugh because the humour is perfect, but it also keeps me interested because the story is so complex and intriguing that I'm constantly wondering what's going to happen next.I love all of the characters. The queen is my favourite. And the actors all have perfect chemistry - it's truly the perfect, dream cast.I could go on and on about this k-drama. I'm so sad it ended and that I can't watch it for the first time again. It will always have a huge place in my heart, I HIGHLY recommend everyone to watch it.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"First thing that comes to my mind is that, it's a historical kdrama which was actually fun, had great comedy instead of the usual sad painful types.

The script is so well written that you can never guess what will happen next . The chemistry between the leads is terrific. I was excited for it since the trailer was out I love how the series makes you laugh even in the intense scenes. Literally a stress buste.I request every one to watch the Korean drama one .Thanks.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"I have seen Shin Hye Sun in three series before this one: Oh, My Ghost, Stranger, and most recently in Hymn of Death. All of the above are dramatic roles, and all I can say is, ""Oh, my God!"" Her comedic chops are off the charts! She is nothing short of brilliant, stealing virtually every single scene that she is in! I compare her to Lucille Ball. While the rest of the cast is absolutely fantastic, this series doesn't work without Shin Hye Sun's incomparable performance!Most body-switching movies and shows are same-gender switches. I've seen just a handful of cross-gender switches, and while they tend to go for comedic effects, the actors tend to overcompensate. The man exaggerates female characteristics such as speech and walking while the woman does the same. Shin Hye Sun, instead, goes for more subtlety and realism as a man who's suddenly been thrust into the body of the Queen. Jang Bong Hwan is a chef from the future, so he not only has to figure out how to live in the body of a woman but also a woman who also happens to be of royalty!What we end up getting is some of the funniest and zaniest roles I've ever seen. Shin Hye Sun brilliantly doesn't even alter her speech very much. Just to the point in her smirk, the way she sits and communicates, which is Jang Bong Hwan's style. In short, she gives us a very masculine queen as well as one from the future, who isn't afraid to inject current idioms, terms, and ideas into her speech, often causing hilarious confusion among the Joseon people from 200 years ago who have no idea what she's talking about. King Cheol Jong even begins keeping a Dictionary of the Queen's Language in an attempt to understand her. He also has no idea why his once docile queen is now far more aggressive and direct in her speech and manners!We are taken back to Joseon about 200 years in the past when a puppet king is being controlled by nearly everyone around him, but most notably by the Grand Queen Dowager, the Queen Dowager, and Kim Jwa Geun (the Grand Queen Dowager's brother). It did take me a few episodes to get the names down because there are so many. Basically, you have two rival families in the Kim's and the Jo's who are vying for control of the country. The Queen is of the Kim family while the King is of the Jo family. Little do they realize that the King is far stronger than anyone realized or anticipated as he struggles to find a way to bring balance and contentment to his subjects, who mostly live in slavery and poverty. But the wild card in this drama is the Queen. No longer meek and docile, Jang Bong Hwan quickly decides that the Queen is nobody's puppet and nobody's fool. Instead, he figures out a way to understand his new role but also how to help the King gain power to stand up to those who would use him for their own purposes.I've said this in numerous reviews already, but Koreans are masters of storytelling and always find a way to convey an uplifting message or something to think about to improve things. This series is no different. Overall, the series is comedic, but it does have some dramatic moments, some heart-wrenching ones, and also some inspiring ones too. In the end, we find that both King Cheol Jong and Queen Kim So Yong (after she's reverted back to herself without Jang Bong Hwan) have both changed (even if Jang Bong Hwan left behind a few seeds of influence!). Jang Bong Hwan, himself, realizes that he is no longer the same, self-serving man that he was before either. He wisely states, ""Perhaps it isn't about trying not to be rotten, but instead cutting out what is rotten."" And that such an idea might-in fact-help to change the world, but it first begins with changing yourself. Gandhi himself stated as much when he said, ""Be the change you wish to see in the world.""This is simply one of the most delightful series I've seen, and it is literally rock solid from beginning to end. I kept waiting to see if the story would begin to falter or drop off slightly toward the end. It didn't. It kept me completely invested from beginning to end.Unfortunately, the government in Joseon from 200 years ago proves that not much has changed in the world since that time. The rich still oppress the poor. The powerful still exploit the weak are always in search of ways to retain even more power. Mr. Queen gives us some food for thought; that just because that is how things are, it doesn't mean that nothing can be done or that they must somehow stay that way. King Cheol Jong and Queen Kim So Yong give us two examples of what can be done if will, determination, and courage are vested.

You can even see the storyline. The king actually loves the modern queen (actually Jang Bong-Hwan), so, I don't really think he will continue loving the queen or finding her as interesting after the last episode where Bong-Hwan leaves queen's body.Wish the ending could be different.

The fixation on evil Ministers.2. Dowagers that have WAY too much power to the point it becomes a deus-ex-machina situation to move the plots along.3. Kings (and Queens) that are surrounded by hundreds of staff and guards, yet are always successful at eluding them when they fancy a stroll in -cognito.4. Bad guys who are ALWAYS successful at spying and spreading rumors everyone believes.5. and Good Guys who have zero spying ability, are always caught flat-footed like they're complete morons, and can never convince ANYONE of the truth.6.

Top notch acting,amd while being hilarious, it still had a serious plot to follow.0It was beautifully created and was a wonderful show to watch. I'm particularly fond of the beauty and style of the show. It was beautiful, funny, and touching all at the same time.I am beyond glad that I had the opportunity to watch this show and I would suggest that others who don't speak the language -- please watch this.

Just watch it when you feel low or depressed this will bring you up with all those uplifting emotions. Best kdrama I ever seen.If you love time travel watch this.If you love messed up dramas influenced by time travel watch this.If you love comedy plus drama messing with time travel - simply silently watch this.If you want to have those uplifting feelings filled with emotions, especially when you watching korean drama series - watch this.Oh man oh man, this female lead actress really did her best. She overperformed it, nailed it, she expressed her best acting which is hilarious and emotions at the same time.I truly felt that she was from a modern era chef who accidentally time travelled to past joseon era and trapped in a female body, I really felt that there was a men trapped inside her body.Just watch it lovely people.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

There is a well-balanced mix of comedy, history, drama, suspense and action.There are plenty of twists, badass fight scenes, funny things (iconic moments with Mr Queen of course, but also with Lady Choi!). Each character is shining, they're all favorites, even the villains (and there are plenty of them). I loved that there is a real ending too, contrary to a lot of dramas who disappoint a bit in their final episodes.This is definitely a drama you can't forget and you'll enjoy so much. About the controversies, seriously if you really watch the drama you'll see that Korean history is never ridiculized, this is the opposite, it's all so fascinating (from a foreigner point of view), the culture is really well explained, we're just in awe watching about it. Somehow I wish there was a season 2 because I really enjoyed everything about it, but it's true that the ending is perfect. It's just so good we want more.

I really highly recommend to watch this great addictive show.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"I've been thinking about this review for quite some time, wondering if I would do it. In the end, I had to get some stuff out of my system.This show is amazing. It had to make a dent in a whole iceberg of similar stories. It did. It was refreshing and original, truly unique. It actually stands on top of the mountain. Even dare I say (don't castigate me) before Scarlett Hearts.It's not perfect. There were moments when I got bored enough to fast forward, or even wonder if I would keep watching. One reason was the Queen being so powerless with all her knowledge of the future. But after some thoughts, it actually made sense. No one in a palace is as vulnerable and as powerless as the queen.Two things kept me hooked.First, Hye-Sun Shin. I don't think I have sufficent knowledge of English to describe the way her acting made me feel. I usually don't think much of Korean actresses. I find most of them are terribly lacking. I aknowledged HSS as a good actress in Angel's Last Mission, Still17, and Hymn To Death, but I never actually liked her. Someting about her visuals. So, when I saw her in this drama, I thought ""Oh, no, not her, please not her, why?!!!"" My disappointment lasted about 15 minutes. After that I was like OMG, she's so beautiful, I want to marry her! That mischievious, naughty, arrogant look on her face, her mocking smile, her smoldering eyes... I went head over heals.Beyond that, there was her mind-blowing performance. I could really see the man inside a woman's body. Of course, it was over the top, it had to be, because the whole story was goofy. She still managed to stay true to her character(s), through and through. At some point, I could tell, just by looking at her face, who was in control of the body. She deserves a Korean Oscar.The second thing is the love story. I've been trying to get over The Smile Has Left Your Eyes for a while now. Not there yet, but this love stoty here managed to revive my heart a bit.That's why. That's why I can't forgive the ending. This is and I mean every word, the worse ending ever. It looked like a ""lived happily forever after"" when in fact, it was a cruel, gruesome, treachourous, vicious murder of that beautiful love story.I don't understand it. I can't inderstand it. I spent a lot of time reading posts about this. A lot of viewers were left as distraught as me. Why? Why??? Who does that? Build a heart-snatching love for 19 episodes and then smash it to pieces with just a few scenes? I tried my best to look for clues that the love wasn't real to begin with. I tried to come up with some explanation, just to survive the betrayal. The Queen and the chef were actually a single soul. Bong Hwan was never in love: the queen was coexisting with him and controled him at times. The king fell in love with his wife DESPITE her flaws not because of them. A piece of Bong Hwan stayed with the Queen.... There are clues to support all those thories.Still. What I saw, what turned my heart into a blaze, was CheolJong and Bong Hwan. The two of them. And the way The king can't even realize that he's lost his love forever is just the saddest thing I've seen in 90 dramas. Looking at the ""Queen's dictionary"" and saying ""Have I lost something? Sometimes, my heart..."" It's not enough. It's not enough. I realize how difficult it must have been to come up with a satisfying ending. Actually, I kept wondering how the writers would manage their way out of this complicated situation. They did what no creator should do. They just went and betrayed their own characters, they destroyed their own work. Incredible. There were other ways.I hope writing this down will help me move on. :'(",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

tt13400006,"What a fun drama to watch. I decided to watch this because I'm a huge fan of Choi Jin Hyuk and even though he's barely seen on camera this drama is a gem. The Queen acting like a man is hilarious. The way Shin Hye Sun walks, stands, sits and talks is so spot on. She's dressed so feminine and her hair done so perfectly that the contrast cracked me up every time. The character development in this is so good. You fall in love with so much of the cast. It felt similar to how you fall in love with the characters in Crash Landing on You. The men and women surrounding the King and Queen were cast so brilliantly, even the villains. It felt like you were dropped in the middle of the story and you didn't know what was happening just like the Queen and then it slowly takes you on a ride and unfolds along the way. Brilliantly told Kdrama. One more thing, the Kings' deep laugh he does is hilarious! Believe me, you don't want to miss this one!",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"Until 2022, this was my favourite K drama (although Crash Landing on you and Sky Castle both tied it). It's about a modern day Michelin star chef who ends up in the body of a young queen in the Joseon period. Obviously there's going to be body swap comedy, but they managed to make drama and comedy from the time travel aspects, even with an undercurrent of political drama that it eventually culminates with.The first 2 episodes are mostly introduction and setup, but it picks up by the 3rd episode (when the cooking element is hilariously reintroduced).Shin Hye Sun (Oh my Ghost, Stranger) previously wasn't given much to work with. As the titular Queen, she absolutely knocks it out of the park; you van easily tell which person is inhabiting her.We originally watched this a couple of years ago on Viki (signed up just to watch this and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon) and we were looking forward to re-watching this on Netflix, but we're very disappointed to find one of the soundtrack songs replaced. The instrumental version of ""Like it's Summer"" is supposed to be the ""falling in love"" theme; somehow they managed to make an instrumental song *funny*.The entire soundtrack was phenomenal; even with the 1 song replaced on the Netflix broadcast.Yes it's silly in parts, clever in some, and occasionally surprising.

Hands down one of the best k dramas I've seen to date, and I've seen my share of them! I wish for a season 2, but I doubt there will be one. I can hope though 🤞. As an American, I watch more Korea shows then any other genre out there. This one is a perfect example why! I can't get enough!So, when the story begins, the character is a male cook that drowns in water and then wakes up in a ""to be"" female queen's body way back in the historical Joseon times. The queen was due to marry the king the following day. Well, with the male cook being fully aware of himself but now in a females body, I was confused on how the storyline could work, but it did. It was a comedy till the end, but inbetween the laughs, the show was well filled with serious emotional, romantic, fun loving content. It's difficult to explain to someone just how awesome this show is without giving away spoilers.

It was a good ending, though many don't like it, it is better than Moon Lovers.The drama was hilarious, there was no episode without a funny scene. Even in a sad scene, there still must be something funny LMAO. The queen was so funny because her soul was hiding behind a modern man's soul. The plot and story-line were also intense and very good.

tt13400006,"""Cheolinwanghoo"" or ""Mr Queeen"" is that rare gem that combines different genres so effortlessly to give its viewers much joy to watch, with each episode of the series consistently well-written and acted.Based on the Chinese web series ""Go Princess Go,"" which itself was based on the Chinese novel of the same name, it is a comedy, a drama, a historical period piece, a mystery, a gender bender, a cooking show, and an entertaining story all rolled into one.As a Korean remake, ""Mr Queen"" is far superior to the Chinese version, which had many issues such as low production value, bad acting, and bad dialogues. Thankfully, the Korean version was better resourced.The Good: All the actors were quite good, but lead Shin Hye-sun as Queen Cheorin stood out for her convincing portrayal of a modern regular Korean man transported 200 years into the past.The Bad: Thankfully there weren't anything too glaringly bad. However, if I have one complaint it is the overuse of dramatic music that's all too common among Korean TV dramas.The series was one of the best rated in Korea, and it's easy to see why.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"I found out about this series because I had seen another series with the main actress, Hye-Sun Shin, who I must have really liked, but too long ago to remember what film, and the trailer I saw impressed me. And part of the reason I pay attention to this actress is that she is tall at 172 cm. I get tired of seeing Korean films with leading actors that are over 180 cm, which is very tall for Koreans, and women that are at best average. Let's me feel like the actor is playing opposite a child. So, I like to see tall actresses getting parts. I have to say that Hye-Sun Shin really made the series, and that is good because she was the most critical character for the series. She just did such a great job of making the situation of being a man from the modern era as a queen in the Korea of the past so funny. And there were excellent actors actress around her. Chong-ok Bae as the dowager queen also did a great job of creating an interesting character, Cha Cheong-hwa as the head of the Hye-Sun Shin's head of household, and Hye-Sun Shin as the head of the Royal Kitchen also added so much to the amusement and interest in the show. So many other great supporting actors and actresses. Really did think the casting was really great. I cannot say the lead actor, Na In-Woo, impressed me but it was not a really demanding role, and maybe a much more subtle character was better. The casting I think was excellent and helps makes this film a lot of fun to watch, and mostly kept my attention.The plot of course is silly. It has some disconnects mainly because the main character is a man in a woman's body that still finds himself attracted to women, and that has to move to a falling in love with the king, and I think it stumbles a little bit, but only a little bit. Lots of twists, but not as shocking as some other k-dramas I have seen that really keep you off balance.Since there a number of times when Hye-Sun Shin was impersonating a man, it actually was somewhat believable since she is about as tall as a lot of men, although a very slim build and an effeminate face. Not like the ""The King's Affection"" which came across as so ridiculous with 163 cm Park Eun-bin. And in that film she is playing against KBS Ro Woon is 190.5 cm tall, Nam Yoon Soo is 186 cm tall and Byung Chan is 185 cm tall. How could anyone be fooled. But at in this show Hye-Sun has the height to reasonably pass off as a man, and there are some very cute scenes where she it impersonating a man. There are also a few cases where her height over other women is useful in creating a better sense of her being intimidating.This is a very amusing film with a lot if very cute scenes.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt13400006,"How can I do this series justice? I chose it because I loved Live Up to Your Name which also featured Yoo Min-kyu, and the plot twist of looping between time periods seemed similar.

Disbelief, surprise - the music made it into my dreams, the hutz pah of the main character really me think, I finally thought that she/he was very inspiring.Every single actor was great. The means in which small scenes stole the show. The role of cooking in the show. The never ending visual pleasure of the costumes, architecture, countryside, the choreography, the physical comedy, the class struggle, the human empathy, the government rituals which avoided truth, the scheming and then there are the redeemed players and the tragedy and comedy of love.

It feels like I'm going to explode into a thousand pieces.What I liked the most is the fact that it made me cry with sadness and then with joy in many scenes, which almost never happens to me.

Shin Hye Sun did a blockbuster performance as a chef who got stuck in the body of a queen. Her acting,comic timing,everything was top notch. What a gem she is!!!But the only thing that i found slightly disappointing was the ending. I mean...it was not the queen whom the king actually loved. It was the duel personality of her,her tantrums,her weirdness,her smartness which is not the queen only. It was the mix of both the queen and also the chef. It was really surprising how the King,who remembered every little thing the queen said,didn't even realise how her personality changed in the end and she started to call her Cheona in stead of his name. He couldn't even know about the body swap...I think that was kind of injustice to him. There could be so many ways how it could end...the chef could die and be reincarnated as So Yong in modern life and also the king could be reincarnated as he wished in the epilogue and both could meet in the modern world.However, apart from that,its a must watch if you want a laughter riot with a touch of history!!!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

Our leading male, Du-sik, is a savant jack of all trades choosing to live a simple small town life filled with meaningful relationships vs a profitable city career.

He is a total Renaissance man: capable, accomplished, considerate, humorous, athletic, and very good looking.While the characters seem at first glance to follow a standard construct, I am anticipating that the story arc will continue to be intelligent, as it is touching on a number of contemporary issues to do with prejudice and assumptions. The writer seems to have developed considerable back stories and subtext for the majority of the characters, although we are not yet privy to all of them (as of episode four).I'll edit and update as the season progresses.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14518756,"EDIT: Now that we are nearly at the end, and as a viewer that has fully immersed myself in this drama right from the start to now (finished episode 15), I can say that this drama is definitely the second best series (after squid game) I've watched in 2021. I like dark dramas, and intense plotting, revenge against each other, weird monsters stuff, but every weekend exactly at 10pm, I find myself waiting impatiently for HTCCC to drop a new episode on Netflix, this is my perfect dose of relaxation. I don't know about cliche storylines or whatsoever, I'm watching because of the chemistry of the entire cast of this drama, the setting, how they are having fun on set. It was almost they were really living in Gongjin. I love how every single family in Gongjin has a story to tell, even right to the beautiful pre-school teacher. The stories were simple, but realistic. Eg, the pregnant store lady part, the little boy whose parents were divorced. I love to watch the two main leads going on their dates, so rarely we get to have 2 full episodes on lovey dovey scenes in k dramas, you know what's the real cliche for me? It's always when the two main leads going on lovey dates and then suddenly one of them sick or die or they just cannot be together. And it usually happen like 15 mins after they are happy. 🤣🤣 Like finally! We get to see my fav couple having a proper date too. Finally can I just say that the OST for this drama is PERFECT. My fav has got to be Here Always by Seungmin!Sorry the other unhelpful review here has prompted me to start an account here to write a proper review of this drama. There was definitely more dialogue going on, so I'm not sure if that reviewer watched the right drama.To start off, this drama has been touted to be a healing drama, and also finally we have Kim Seon Ho as a lead against Shin Min Ah, two dimples visuals here, so really, what's not to love?The first episode started off light heartedly, and I thought it was a great introduction of the fishing village that will likely be the main setting for the rest of the drama, we have Chief Hong being a know-it-all, and also gave Hye-Jin whose likable personality should be a great hit in the village soon after. The cinematography and natural acting of the actors are great and also in this pandemic, after watching several ""heavy"" dramas from TVN, this is definitely a refreshing change and now I can't wait for the next episode to be out!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14518756,"Short story:- It got me hooked from the very first episode.Long story:- I am someone who have watched plenty of Kdramas in the past and so my standard is pretty high for rating a show as positive. Any show which gets me attached and hooked from early on is straight away deserves 10 stars.Lately at the time of writing there is so much negativity and depressing stuff going on in the world and in our life, i was looking for show which can bring smile on my face after hard day at work. I started few Kdramas on Netflix before this and was struggling to find a decent show.About this show, first of all it is believable, the story I mean. It's so simple yet so beautifully crafted. It's relaxing and doesn't stray away from the story much. The rural setting makes you wanna retire to some place like this in your future. The setting of the town is picturesque and full of colours. Both the lead characters are cute looking and instantly lovable. At times, the show will teach you valuable life lessons also. The romance and chemistry between the two characters are pure and angelic. You know they are made for each other.This is so far my analysis of the show after watching the first few episodes of it. Can't wait how the rest of the story will unfold. So interesting.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14518756,"This is probably my most anticipated kdrama of the year and I am glad to say that I enjoyed every second of it. I usually stay away from romcoms because they tend to have the same formula but homecha is different from the rest.Yes, there was romance and there was comedy, but there were more layers and depths to it; the complexities and simplicity of different types of relationships (romantic, platonic, familial, friendships, etc), the sense of belonging in a community, living life the way you want to, grief and guilt, etc. I smiled, laughed and even cried while watching this.And I love the found family trope in this show, it was so heartwarming how everyone became a huge family and supported each other. The cast was incredible, and thanks to the great writing, they brought so much life and variety to the show. On that note, I have to mention that Kim Seonho and Shin Min-a have amazing chemistry and honestly, the person who casted them deserves a raise. This show is a gem and kudos to the entire team that worked on it because they created something that touched many people's hearts.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14518756,"We've seen a lot of opposite atracts shows, series, and films, but not many of them are drawn up quite so wonderfully and heartfelt as this one. Much of the success of this series has to go to Mina Shin and Seon-Ho Kim with their incredible chemistry.Dr. Yoon (Mina Shin) is a successful dentist who loves living the good life full of fancy clothes, expensive cars, and everything else that goes with high-end living. She makes no apologies for her lifestyle. Perhaps it's because she's really known nothing else.Upon leaving her job, due to conflict with her boss, Yoon leaves for the small seaside town of Gongjin. The last place she felt happy as a child. There, she meets Chief Hong, a man who seems capable of doing literally everything! He works a slew of jobs, all for minimum wage. In short, he enjoys the simple life of service.Of course, at first, these two opposites do not get on very well. Yoon finds herself stranded in the town on her first day without money or even able to get funds due to a power outage. She's soon at the mercy of Chief Hong, who ends up putting her to work pulling the guts out of squid with the local women. You can only imagine how well Yoon is able to adapt.Without a job and a town without a dentist, Dr. Yoon decides to open up a dental clinic. The series is much about Yoon learning to appreciate a different lifestyle that is very different from anything she's ever experienced. This, of course, includes Yoon learning how to be a team player and adapt to the locals as well as the town itself. ""Grandma"" Gam-ri all but steals the show and our hearts.As you can imagine, Yoon and Chief Hong soon become attracted to each other. However, Hong has a dark past that he soon finds is catching up with him. The question becomes: will his past destroy things with Dr. Yoon before they've even started?Dr. Yoon represents those people who can only think about themselves. She comes off initially as fussy and conceited. However, the longer she spends in Gongjin, we see her begin to learn how to love and appreciate others. And Mina Shin has that million dollar smile and those golden dimples to brighten our days with!Chief Hong is a man who is a complete opposite. He thinks mostly of others, even at the expense of himself. In short, he doesn't believe himself to be truly worthy. And he has no idea just how much he's loved and adored by the people of Gongjin.Both are two sides of the same coin. Both have to learn how to adapt. You cannot love others without first loving yourself. And you cannot love others at the expense of yourself either.Of course, as Chief Hong's secret is uncovered, only those who see him for who he is--by his constant example of a man with a good heart--we know that he was not responsible for what happened. Those unable to forgive him are simply cowards who decide that it's easier to play the role of the victim rather than take any responsibility. I was slightly disappointed in Dr. Yoon's reaction to him; that she didn't seem to know him nearly as well as those he's lived with in Gongjin. Everyone else tried to check up on him. She didn't. It's easy to be there for someone when things are good. It's challenging--and even more important--to be there for someone when things are difficult. Also, one should never put pressure on someone to reveal that which they are not ready to tell. Yoon was quite selfish in her demands. Fortunately, she wisely realizes her mistake and tells Chief Hong that he can tell her when he's ready.We get a lot of laugh out loud moments as well as some truly touching ones that are sure to tug at your heart. Koreans are masters of incorporating both elements into their stories. The people of Gongjin will surely warm your heart and perhaps make you even wish that you lived in such a community!All in all, this is a fantastic and delightful series! I loved and adored all sixteen episodes! And it's proof that you can have good and likeable characters still, in world that seems to want to bombard us with dark ones. This show was refreshing like a wonderful day at the beach, which only made me wanting even more!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt14518756,"This is Extra-ordinary. WELL this K-Drama is nothing different or new but felt EXTRAORDINARY because of more ordinary things , people and story.Show setsup a world and stays true to that world. There are cliches, there are expected things happening but it seems very authentic because of the right presentation of characters and their story.It doesn't confuse you much with lot of twists and bringing in unnecessary characters to keep the curiosity or make it forcefully interesting,
At the same time it doesn't get bored, though its almost the same characters that you see in every episodes. Characters are presented in an authentic way and also showing their past playing a role in what they are today.All actors have done their part well, but Best part is of course the acting between the leads - Ufff Sparks fly and they make us feel the chemistry is real but unlike some other Dramas there is no much overacting here.Negatives - So far None , have finished watching 10 episodes. Will update my final review after the final episode.If you are looking for a feel good rom com drama, then watch it for sure. Breeze of romance and goodness will definitely hit you with this show :)",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Plus, it's cinematic background just like I went to watch the place myself. 😍No big events & so heavy topics up until now, so i think this drama can be a healing ""me time"" after a long exhausted working days. It suitable to watch together with family too. It's gonna be fun relating Gongjin Villagers's story to our life too.For romance part, i think its like typical love story but maybe when the main leads start push & pull their real feelings, we will enjoying it more.

Total waste of time towards the end to be honest.No doubt the cast was nicely done, the story is simple and heart warming. The star of the show is the lead couple, especially Kim Seon-Ho. I also liked the title track 'Sunday'. Nice.While watching the series I got so bored that I watched two other series and finished it and one Hollywood movie. I somehow managed to finish the show in the end.There is no way this series deserves a rating of 8+.

tt14518756,"This was such a chill-out, light-hearted, and unproblematic drama that was shot near the seaside area, so had AMAZING cinematography. Every shot was picture perfect, the colours were well balanced, and the captures of nature were absolutely breathtaking.This is like a photographer's dream.That being said, the overall drama is quite nice. It's easier to take into the mind too. After a stressful day, you can watch this and be at ease. The drama doesn't have any heavy plots that keep you thinking about it throughout the week. While it's not a boring watch at all, it doesn't have the thought-provoking or intriguing aspect to it. So, we can watch an episode, feel good, forget till the next episode.Everything about the drama is very predictable from the get-go and the characters are not deeply fleshed out. Everyone's a good person too. Therefore, not much difficult acting is required. Which is quite fortunate because the main cast were mediocre actors.As much as I love and adore Shin Minah, her acting range is quite limited and if you binge-watch the episodes, there is a probability of you getting a bit annoyed with her ""baby talking"", and the same three expressions for everything. Kim Seonho on the other hand displayed good acting in the latter episodes even though he was very stiff in the early episodes. This could be due to the way his character was written as a too-perfect guy at first (which tends to be quite boring) and then later we find he has a bit of layer to him which makes him more interesting. Lee Sangyi is a new addition to my drama watching and I have to say he's a fresh find. I've already seen him in Prison Playbook but I did not know it was the same actor who played the murderous bully in Prison Playbook and is now playing the nicest guy in this show. He has an amazing singing tone and seems to have great potential as an actor too. However, he still needs improvement which I'm sure I will see from his future acting jobs.Other than the main cast, the supporting cast does a decent job and their stories are very interesting that keep you engaged in the drama. I for one watched the drama mainly for the stories of the others especially the story about the two divorcées and the teacher, their child's reaction to their relationship, the ex-star singer's story, which I found quite compelling.To conclude, I recommend this drama for you if you like a peaceful watch without many complications. The mesmerizing sceneries will be an added advantage!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Sadly, the adorable people from Gonjin are not the neighbours in ""Reply 1988"": It takes some talent to turn an ensemble cast amusing.

You will be absolutely addicted once you watch it (the epilogue of each episode are incredible!) ... and will fall in love with the leading stars, especially with Kim Seon-ho.Kim Seon-ho is making a storm in K-drama world these days! «Home Cha-Cha-Cha» is doing great. Fans of him are going crazy how good he is in this TV-series and the very lovable chemistry between him and his leading lady, SMA.I think, it actually began with his role as Han Ji Pyung in «Start-Up» where he totally outshined the leading actors.I can explain though this on-going phenomenon. Kim Seon-ho is gifted with a baby face which is sweet, innocent and handsome... and a youth-looking body (hoping he stays that way and won't be pumping much muscles like most actors do) with an amazing physique like an athlete. Just watch his remarkable performances in 2 Days and 1 Night... he stands out in almost every task he does! His charm... Wow! Who doesn't melt seeing him smile or laugh? Add his dimples too!What impresses me most though is his acting skills, either with or without dialogues. He is such a natural talent! Every facial and body movements of his give significance to his role/character. Need I mention, «micro-expressions»? The way he delivers his lines is beyond perfect. He owns the stage/screen when he performs! He steals the scene/show from his co-performers and he absolutely captures his audience! We smile, when he smiles... we cry, when he cries.I hope I am not being unfair to the remaining cast and to the crew, being so focused on Kim Seon-ho. The leading lady, Shin Min-a is totally captivating too on screen. She's so lovely and a fantastic actress. She and KSH act so naturally that definitely make the viewers to believe they're a real couple. As I said, their chemistry is just great! This «dimple couple» has created an unforgettable screen-sweethearts. So heartwarming scenes of them! The supporting cast are adorable too!The producers, the very delightful script/plot, the beautiful cinematography, the admirable soundtrack/OST, the director's fantastic job, the enchanting setting, the commendable film crew/production team and all the lovesome actors and actresses make «Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha» a huge success!

Hong doesn't care about any of that. They are opposites but so perfect for each other. Hong Du-sik is so handsome and his personality is cute - I love his ""okay"" replies!

I just felt offended on Du-sik's behalf.When him and his friend were driving home, where his friend was driving - his friend took his eyes off the road and ended up in an accident. For some reason he blamed himself when it wasn't his fault.Did they even get the truck driver?!I found it annoying how Yoon Hye-Jin, shin-min a, was kind of getting annoyed that du-sik wasn't opening up to her so fast.There could have been some more focus on Choi Eun-Cheol and Pyo Mi-Seon relationship and comedy aspect. The part where she had to ask him out and him being slow was comical.Also there was the unnecessary death of his gran.Overall it was going somewhere good but episode 15 was annoying, obviously in the end they get married though.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

You can stan Korean shows as much as you want, but how does that help a wider audience appreciate the good shows out there? They'll see that almost all shows are scored around 8.5 and assume it's all the same quality. If the first show they watch is an actual good one, they'll watch more Korean shows.

tt14518756,"This was a cute story about 2 people rebuilding their lives in a sleepy harbor town. You have an uptight dentist and a knowledgeable do-it-all handy man with a dark past. The actors were all very likeable, especially the side characters who brought charm and life to this story. From 3 elderly women, a former singer, a shy police officer, a divorced couple, a married couple with kids, and three fussy youngsters. The male lead is very likeable and has great energy. I have seen him in other shows but would like to see him in more leading roles like this one.There were a few parts that dragged on, like the melodrama with the lead male actor. He was great and has such a warm smile. I was less interested in seeing him in tears , especially with a smile that brightened up the screen. I like that the romance between the lead characters felt very grown up, even in the hinted at romantic intimacy. This show deserves all of the hype. Well done.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I was especially pleased to see a professional woman who wasn't a corporate witch. But then it started to fall apart. I hated the wardrobe for Shin Min Ah's character it ranged from matronly to juvenile and was very confusing i got really sick of the big puffy sleeves and knee socks. What made it hard to watch was when the two got together she acted like a person in their early twenties or even younger. I know she has a reputation for adorable but this was sickly sweet and didn't match the age of her character. However, when things got serious the acting really improved and I like the last two episodes much more than the ones that came right before them.

Also when she semi finds out about what he's keeping to himself...she's the one sobbing and saying she's not okay?????

tt14518756,"After being unable to finish another K-Drama sponsored by Netflix, 'Was It Love', I was pleasantly surprised by how polished this show was. It is literally leagues better than 'Was It Love', in terms of casting, writing, and directing.'Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha', or HCCC for short, stars Shin Min-a, who is a veteran of romantic comedies. I knew what to expect from her, and she more or less delivered. Her performance however, was upgraded by the fact that the leading man, Kim Seon-ho, complimented her very well. I've never seen him in a drama before, but he definitely knocked it out of the park.The main leads chemistry is palatable, and it was genuinely fun to watch them together on-screen. They also provide ample structure for the minor characters to eventually develop and shine. Though I do have to say that I don't like, and probably will never like the cafe owner's daughter - she is insurable.Being 43-years-old, there hasn't been any new shows that provided me with any surprises or intrigue. I've seen enough TV shows and movies to predict where any plot might go. HCCC isn't any different, because it has scenes you've probably seen in plenty of other K-Dramas (i.e., sleeping in the same house). However, the main leads are so likeable, I genuinely wanted to see their rendition of the typical K-Drama tropes.In conclusion, I watched 10-episodes in 3-days easy. The main leads are the ideal pairing, the minor characters are passable, and the drama is very well written and directed. While the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable, this drama will be one I'll definitely re-watch in the future.Highly recommended & binge-worthy.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It's not a bad drama but I think it's very much overrated considering the average storyline and average acting of the main characters. Both the male and female leads are a bit unnatural and always forcing big dimpled smiles because it's considered charming , it looks good but when it happens too frequently it's just too much. On the other hand the supporting characters did a very good job, the mosey woman, the seafood restaurant owner, the old ladies, the cafe owner, and all the kid actors!

Everyone in this small, seaside village is a family and they can easily become the publics' favorite not only because of their strong bond but also because they are funny, dramatic, sweet, and lovable. The setting was also a strong plus of this drama along with the great performances.However, the drama had a predictable story that was pretty much not nearly original, had superficial main leads, who did have chemistry though, and a boring love triangle.

The script had her switch between uptight, snobby, and always complaining to winey childish behavior. 🙄The overall story and the rest of the characters were likeable but the choices made for Ms. Yoon either by the script or the director were often cringe worthy. The actess who played Ms. Yoon was fabulous given the material she was working with.I wish the writers had given the Actress better material to work with. She over hears her boyfriend complain about what she wore and changes everything about the way she dresses. She becomes a snob about everything even though she broke up with him. She moves to a small town to open a dental practice and is rude and looks down on most of the people in the small town. She falls for a local guy who is kind and helpful even though all she does is complain about him. When she finally confesseses her love and he feels the same she wants to keep it a secret from the smalltown. But because she doesn't want anyone to know they are dating they pretend they aren't. Then she wines and moans about missing him when he's not with her every moment. Creates excuses to see him but hits or kicks him and tells him to leave her alone if people see them too close to eachother. Then apologizes via text and wines for his company some more.It was the worst character arc I've ever seen in an othewise good show. Especially for a lead character.

tt14518756,"In Hometown Cha Cha Cha, community is family, and this story is truly slice of life, giving a window into the lives of various people living and working in a small coastal town in Korea.Many K-dramas fall into the romance trap: that is, focusing only on a romance between the two leads while foregoing all else, and all other characters. Hometown Cha Cha Cha, similar to Vincenzo, doesn't fall into this trap at all, but seems incredibly aware of the importance of a cast with chemistry and equal character development.The characters are real, they make mistakes, they grow, they evolve in their relationships. The audience slowly learns more and more about the townspeople and gets attached to them just as much as the main leads.This K-Drama was incredibly wholesome, cute, and progressive.Featured heavily are feminist principles such as a working woman as the female lead who often takes the first step to pursue the male love interest, who doesn't fit into the stereotypical mold of a working man, but instead is carefree, troubled, complex, emotional, and sometimes even weak.Additionally, later on, audiences will find out that a side character is gay, and see her history of alienation for it, but also acceptance by townspeople when she comes out about it.These themes and more are what make Hometown particularly wholesome, but also unique in that it is not afraid to tackle hard, nuanced, and complex subjects in ways that most K-Drama fans are not used to. 9/10.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It's a faux pas to say it out loud, but the fact is some dramas get rave reviews not because they're particularly great dramas, but because they touch on certain subjects people like. For example, people just love dramas featuring autistic leads. It is what it is. In this drama, people are swooning over the pretty beach setting and the way the ML dotes on little old ladies. Seriously, that's a huge part of the show.It's true. There's nothing particularly excellent about this drama except those unique things that set it apart. There are no high stakes, no stakes at all really...nothing really happens in every episode except characters talking and going about their lives in this town. There are a few dramatic moments for sure, but not many. I found myself fast forwarding scenes of talking that had nothing to do with the plot and wishing for more drama. I also don't find the FL likable, she comes across as a snob. The ML is great.If it sounds like your cup of tea, go for it.

tt14518756,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Romantic Comedy with 16, 60 minute episodes. Alternatively known as Seaside Village Cha Cha, Seashore Village Cha Cha and Fishing Village Cha Cha.Yoon Hye-jin's (Shin Min-a) life takes an unexpected turn when she decides to stand up to her employer for overcharging their dental patients. After outing her employer on social media she find she has been blacklisted in the Seoul dental community and decides to take a trip to Gongjin, a coastal town where she had found memories as a child. Once there fate seems to step in to keep her there as she loses access to her money and her car suffers mechanical difficulties. A city girl with little skill for country life she finds she has to ask the go to guy of the village, Du-sik, for favor after favor. Hong Du-sik (Kim Seon-ho) is not only the top bachelor in the village but also an indespensible member of the village community. If it needs solved Du-sik can likely solve it, and if it is broken he is most likely to fix it. One thing the village lacks is a dental office and Hye-jin is a dentist that needs some work. Not only does fate decide to continually throw Hye-jin and Du-sik together but it also has landed her in a town in need of her skills. Will this sleepy seaside village be that little something in Hye-jin's life she didn't even realize she was missing? Is there a future for these two very different souls that fate has thrown together?I rarely find a drama near perfect. There are just so many out there and always aspects that could use improvement. But I have to say, on this one, it is near perfect. I liked how the characters were complex and showed good character growth. The various stories of the people in the town kept it interesting. The romance was very heart warming. They are both amazing actors and had good chemistry. I did not feel too bad for the second lead even though I liked him a lot. It ended well and was neither too drawn out nor lacked in completing the story. The one very minor thing I was not a huge fan of was the romance with the 2nd guy and his writer. She was just a very flat, and I felt, somewhat cold, character. I could not get behind their connection as she seemed like someone that was not very compatible with him and all it seemed she did was nag at him a lot. It was clear she was jealous and a lot of her behavior was around her.

Sadly that was it for me, and when they stopped shining I stopped watching.The story is basically city girl meets country boy.Their social status isn't as different as she might think, so she can date him >.> Too bad, he doesn't like her like that, but he better watch out, her ex is coming to town.It has all the cliches, all the tropes and the right amount of cheese.

I wanted to rate this programme below 5, however I had to remind myself as a Greek Australian dude, perhaps I could not connect with this series because I am not Korean. I have seen quite a few Korean productions on netflix in the last two years. However, as much as I was highly anticipating this show, I had to sadly let it go after just two episodes. It is quite common in Australian/UK/USA productions that episodes run between 30-50 minutes per episode, so if the first episode or two don't impress oneself, one is willing to give the series another go for a few more episodes. But when the drama consists of 70minute episodes, and you realise you have been there, done that, sadly interest is lost. I just couldn't invest another 70 minutes of my time because... In just two episodes... we have two different characters bumping into each other consistently in a city of ten million people... we have the all cliched orphaned main characters, the leading female character slips and falls into the arms of the lead male...we have the two leads staring into the ocean alone, whilst thinking to themselves out loud...which, really, let's face it, noone does this ever in real life... and we have flashback that the leading two characters have met before, albeit thirty years ago as children.

His past could have been less painful but, even so, they did do it well. Hye-jin was the one he could open up and be his rock.

tt14518756,"We have seen that another very good TV series has been ""Netflix""ed and wasted.Nowadays people want to be loved. For some unknown reason she wants him to fall in love with her and for that person to love her no matter what. And that this person, of course, suddenly enters their life. Naturally, he enjoys watching this fantasy as well. Of course, Netflix knows that this is overwatched. That's why they add this crap to every drama. Love. Love is indispensable. By doing this, they made me disgusted with love.Korean dramas are sweet. It encourages you. You want to live there, enter that sweet world. So is this series. All the people in the village are so sweet. Hong and the director are definitely very good characters as well. You know which character is not good? Dentist lady. They also show this character, which they put in the series just to put people's fantasy of love, as if he is the main character in the first episode. Yes, he quit his job to keep his promise. They are waiting for you to show it to you and love the girl. As if that wasn't enough, they put his childhood or something in between. Since this character is our lead, give the story over him and it will be over. They were too lazy to write officially and a character beyond disgrace emerged.Now let's get this girl out of the story. Hong's story is simply amazing. I personally love redemption stories, but the events he lived through and the effects of these events are so accurately reflected that I think his story came from someone who had experienced such an event or a psychologist. Maybe he's just a very successful writer. But unfortunately it is not possible to believe that the dentist lady is the same as the author. Apart from Hong's story, there are two small stories in the series that I find incredibly successful. Let's not forget them either.I found the acting in the movie successful. Lee Sang-Yi was the person who caught my eye with his acting in this drama. I think it does a great job even with simple gestures. Also, the older characters were definitely more realistic than I expected from them. Since I don't follow Korean cinema, I don't know how famous these actors are, but none of them managed to win my heart by smiling.The thing is, the acting is very good. However, love is not that easy for Hong character. My heartfelt congratulations to Netflix for screwing up the beautiful story just to add love.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt14518756,"This drama gives off a refreshing vibe. I love how each character is balanced and how the neighborhood helps the main couple move forward.As you can obviously see, the main FL was picky when it came to finding herself a boyfriend. As she did say, the difference between her and the ML has a huge gap (Doctor - part-timer), but the more one gets to know one another, love has its own way.Though I am still currently in ep.12, and still don't know what the ML has gone through in the 5 years after graduating at SNU, I know this will add some development to the couple's lovelife if the FL were to find out.Again, everything is amazingly balanced, a typical love triangle, but that's okay. That ML triangle guy will eventually find love in the end.The side couple development is so wholesome and fluffy, i love it and it makes my heart flutter.The subplot nightmare of the main ML... how do i explain it... it's good...I've read novels wherein the ML has nightmares, and i do know how it ""usually"" turns out, but i hope this will be different.In short, 10 stars.

Such decent living. Such amazing manners. Such growth and learning these characters experienced.

After the first two episodes I wasn't completely sold, but persevered through 16 episodes.I fell in love with all the characters, the longer episodes allows for in-depth character development and I related to an aspect of each and every one of them. The honest and fiery connection with Hye-jin and Du-sik was charming and a joy to watch. The story is not your average good guy/bad guy plot, so I never felt overwhelmed by the scenes. When watching other shows that are thrillers/crime/suspense I have felt anxious and uneasy, that why I really enjoy these romantic stories with a twist. It was heartwarming and the ending was a beautiful conclusion to all the characters stories.

By the end of the story, we feel united with, and appreciate even the initially most unlikable members of this tiny community.

The female lead did not grow at all, never listened to the counsel of other characters, and kept acting like a selfish brat. The twist of the story is one of the worst ever written in a K-drama. The whole time, the male lead's mysterious issue is that he was guilt tripping over things that were never even his fault. He took all of the blame for something that an idiotic and greedy security guard did, taking a risky investment, pouring all his savings and rent deposit on a volatile instrument which the lead male told him not to do, and that ended up tanking. So who ended up taking the loses and the blame? The male lead, his bestfriend died driving him to the hospital because the idiot security guard tried to commit suicide and failed. Then he sold everything he had and gave it to the security guard's family, as an act of apology Why? I don't get it. What a waste.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Also tells us a bit about Asian/Korean culture specially in smalltown. Acting was tremendous from lead to supporting actors. The music was also very good. I really enjoyed the storyline - how this is something we used to see all other series in netflix or prime. Anyone from smalltown can totally relate the stories with thier life.We recently have watched Too many crime thrillers with lots of tense and stressed stories - this lightheaded one surely will give you a break and only 16 episodes.

It turned out to be one of the cutest Romantic comedies - I just loved how it is so innocent, sweet, lovable with a sense of humor. The leading actor Kim Seon-ho is the perfect person to play this role - you just can't stop watching it. You are laughing one moment, and crying the next. I love how all age generations are portrayed in the sea-town - the older generation giving wisdom and I love learning more about the Korean culture.

tt5182866,"I can't stress it enough that watching a piece that is so simple will be the one that touches your soul very closely.If you are doubting whether you should watch this show or not because one of your friend suggested you to, TRUST THEM COMPLETELY.I will tell you how your days will go after watching this show. First, you have to trust all the good reviews in the world and start watching. Second, you will enjoy this show starting from the first episode. Third, nobody will tell you to continue watching further, but you will anyway. Then after finishing this show, you thank your friend. Or should I say you will thank yourself because you chose to finish this show? Doesn't really matter.I find at least 3 reasons why people are doubting this show.First. ""Isn't this show just like any other friendships movie/series?"". Short answer, it's NOT. Don't get me wrong, any kind of good friendships film will definitely warm your heart, I always love friendships films. However, there are too many other treasures to talk about that you can find in this show. Role of moms, dads, admirers, crushes, dreams, siblings, fate, boys gang, girls gang, exes, education, morals, marriages. And why are they even important? Because you will then REALLY understand to be in other people's shoes.Second. ""There are not much going on in 1988, is this even relevant? Isn't this extremely boring?"". Well, definitely you won't find any fancy things here. No fancy fiction things just like any other korean dramas, no major plot twist or whatsoever. My question is, why is that even a problem? Really you don't have to worry all of those questions. The show will still feel very close to us that you really want to be one of the characters. Unfortunately, rewatching the show again and again will be the only way you can make your dream come true.Third. ""I can guess the plot. There is one girl in those friendships, so it will just be triangle or rectangle love story, just like any others."" Again. Please do yourself a favor not to worry these things. There are sooo many things that you can talk about rather than worrying if there is good romance aspects or not.Last thing I want to remind you because you have arrived to this review.

This drama connects us to the nostalgic memory lane of simpleness of life for average people and emphasizes the camaraderie between families, friends, neighbors & every one. It is correlated with the cultural aspects of the past and shows us the boundaries where one might stopped existing. But this drama helps us relive the past and appreciate the generosity and oneness of humanity. This is a genuine drama that gives moral lessons.

tt5182866,"Initially, I would have started this review with ""first of all""... but it would have been inconsistent with the tens of ""first of all"" I'd started with. Why? Because this Korean drama is amazingly accurate in depicting the '85-90's period and idiosyncrasies!... And this appreciation comes from a non-Korean, non-Asian, Hollywood movie-goer, >30's person. Nevertheless, I have never seen a more realistic depiction of common people and their struggles throughout that particular period. I know what I'm talking about because I've experienced it in my neighbourhood and with my family. Because of this and others more, I felt compelled to add my unacquainted review to IMDb.
Bottom line... if you really want to see some great acting (Kudos to the actors!!!) and get an amazing feel of the 85-90's (and this is coming from a non-American, non-Western point of view), I highly recommend this series!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"Best Kdrama I have watched in years. It officially dethrones My Mister (My Ahjussi) as my favorite Korean series.Reply 1988 is set in the year 1988, it revolves around five friends and their families living in the same neighborhood of Ssangmun-dong, Dobong District, Northern Seoul.This series resonates the family values that everyone should foster but most failed to accomplish. Reply 1988 teaches its audience about hope, generosity, unconditional love, gratefulness, friendship, hard work, perseverance, acceptance and a lot more. It's so good that it knocks your humanity and questions your core values. The series has no villain but only misfortunes and heartbreaks. The show's impact lingers to your senses and encourages you to choose the good path, appreciate your loved ones more and be the best version of yourself.Reply 1988 has 20 episodes with more than an hour long each. Despite of that, it never wavered its greatness from beginning to end. I cried and laughed almost every episode. None of the characters has failed to deliver. Even young Jin-ju's cuteness will leave you a mark. Watch out for Jung-Bong! This young man has skills and tricks up his sleeves.One of the photos for this post is Jung-hwan and Duk-seon. Why? Because I shipped them so much and I extremely felt sad when the show ended without giving their romance a chance. Not even a genuine confession. Nonetheless, I am celebrating because the two actors who portrays those characters are dating in real life.The camaraderie of Ssangmun-dong neighborhood is unparalleled. It manifests how a small community builds, changes and cultivates someone's life and legacy. If this series doesn't move you, it's time to evaluate your values and principles.Watch this series and thank me later.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

tt5182866,"A nostalgic look as a group of families living in Seoul. The highs and lows as they face heartbreak, disappointment, and success and jubilation. Each episode is one and a half hours and is quite slow in evolving the drama, but is well acted and the underlying story of we may be poor but we are richer in many other ways is the theme. Although it is a romanticised and dramatic account of family life, people will recognise small snippets of their own families. A little too sentimental for my tastes but I can understand why people rate it so highly as it does have a rich positive message.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"Obviously the writers tried to make Reply 1988 as an unpredictable story but look how they failed miserably because it was so absurd, unclear with so many unanswered questions and it just put us in so much pain I am pretty sure something odd happened during new year's holiday so they changed the script. I mean, come on, You already built 90% of the story about Dukseon and Junghwan and then you destroyed all those moments, clues, Dukseon's husband personality which was obviously Junghwan, with those 10%?

It walked me through the happy occasions as well as trials and tribulations of friends in a small neighborhood in Korea, set in 1988.

This show is one of the best shows i've watched in a while. I liked how this didn't focus only on the leads' romance but the love between friends, and family. I feel like i grew up with them, in that same Ssangmundong street 10-2. I laughed,cried, screamed at the characters every episode like i was a part of their group. It was so heartwarming to see all the relationships between the families..i mean where do we get to see friends like this and neighbours bonding with each other!
This show was so realistic without being overly dramatic and cringy(i like that too ;) ) The best thing about this was the simplicity of the show and the characters. They didn't use mobile phones or any hi-tech gadgets..it was just pure communication with landline phones and face to face <3
This show taught me the value of friendship and family.

tt5182866,"Then, Episode 17 happens, and you're left scratching your head in frustration. But more on that later.The first 16 episodes are a beautifully crafted coming of age drama/comedy. Interesting characters, their ups, their downs. Amazing chemistry. You can sink into your chair and watch these actors do their work for hours at a time. It is comfortable...and comforting. A soul food kind of show. A few gripes regarding prolonged (excessively) teen angst and indecision. But its perfectly forgivable.Important nuggets of information are presented from the past. So, unlike many shows, the flashbacks work!The flash-forwards however DON'T. The time spent in 2015 is a complete waste of screentime. And it adds nothing to the flow of the show. In fact, the way it is presented is a bit cringe worthy.THEN.... EPISODE 17. Now I don't know if they realized they were going to run out of money before completing more episodes, or there was a contract dispute, or the ratings were low so they had to cut the show shorter than planned, but EPISODE 17 is an ABOMINATION of epic proportions!They took a perfectly paced comfortable show for 16 episodes and sped it up like playing an old 33 record on 45 speed. Plus, plot lines that just end. Others that begin out of nowhere. And this jumping year after year until it is 1994. Terribly executed and totally unnecessary to the spirit of the show up to that point. Compound it with inexcusable life choices, inexplicable relationship break-ups, and your left with an utter mess. Gone is all the good feeling. Now, you're left with an abridged version of a show that is speeding its main characters towards adulthood, all in the span of 60 minutes. This after close to 20 hours is spent developing their beautiful formative years. It seemed like such a cop out. And you knew the inevitable was coming.....What is it you ask? Well, what does every Korean show have, and can't do without?Yup, you guessed it....an EPILOGUE.But in this case, the epilogue is FIVE HOURS LONG spanning the last three episodes (ep.18 through 20). It is pointless. All the events could have been hinted at back in 1989, and left to the viewers imagination. But no! The writers have to show you exactly what you knew would happen, and cram all the plotlines into 3 episodes. Highly disappointing last 20% of the show. All that time would have been better spent finishing up the high school years and leaving the rest to the viewer's imagination.A strong NINE (9) stars for the first 16 Episodes.A weak THREE (3) stars for the last 4 Episodes.My advice, watch the first 16 episodes and stop.

I've been watching kdramas for some time now, and I kept postponing watching the reply series, because I read so many good reviews about them and I wanted to watch them after I've watched other dramas of ""lesser quality"". Let's say I was keeping the best for last.So I started with 97 which I rated with 5 stars. But I managed to watch it. Then 94. I managed to watch only the first episode and rated it with 3 stars. Then I tried to watch 88. I only made it through the 2/3 of the second episode.I have no idea why this is considered to be great. The production quality is definitely better than the other two. The acting is decent. BUT.... There are so many annoying characters. I kept feeling frustrated watching them. Especially the sisters. They were acting like they were 8 years old at best. At some point the little brother (age 17) started crying and calling for his mother because his sister hit him. Seriously?I've read many comments about the realism of the series. This is definitely not true. Unless people in Korea actually behave like this.I'm sorry but this is unwatchable for me.

tt5182866,"After Parasite winning the Oscars, I became curious in other film and TV works from Korea. I watched Reply 1988 and it opened a whole new world to me. I have never seen a TV show like this. It was absolutely amazing how well the storylines are written and the characters are developing each episode.The cast is top notch. They blend drama, romance and comedy perfectly. The older experience cast gave the story richness. The younger cast did an amazing job and the chemistry was real. This is what real friendship looks like. Their coming-of-age story lines are touching and entertaining.The show is much more than the often discussed love triangle. It shows love in a much broader and deeper way between friends, parents, siblings and family.The story has a lot depth. It has references to actual events happening at the end of the 80s, like the Seoul Olympics and the pro-democracy protests. It captures that zeitgeist perfectly. I did not understand all the cultural references to pop culture around that time, but I could certainly appreciate it.Reply 1988 is Korean, but at the same time it tells a universal story in a unique and brilliant way. Therefore, it transcends different cultures. It will actually teach you valuable life lessons. And that makes this show an absolute gem to watch.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

The additional drama of love relationships just added a heart warming touch to keep you interested with the show. This series made me want to keep watching it and I really hated when it had to end, but it was such a great ending.

tt5182866,"I am a fan of Reply series, all of them are great but I like Reply 1988 the best. It has great OSTs, good cinematography, and superb casts with superb acting skill.This drama focuses on the families' relationship in a not so quiet neighborhood. This drama shows ordinary life of middle-class citizens, with no blockbuster k-dramas clichés. There is no evil mother-in-law, sick main lead, or the love line between a poor girl and a rich boy. However, just like its predecessors (Reply 1997 & Reply 1994), it also has a mystery to be solved: ""Who is the female lead's husband?"". Sadly, some people still can't get over their disappointment towards the ending of the drama. I personally like who the girl ended up marrying with tho. If you don't have any curiosity or don't root for any of the male leads to be Deoksun's husband, then you can just watch it as it is. But if in the middle of the drama you change your mind, I suggest you to watch it from episode 1 and look closely to every details (e.g. the dolls or the actors' lines). You might need to read what Baduk is, or notice the fact that one of male lead is inspired by a real Baduk player, or look for what Dooly is. Please keep in mind that this drama has strong cultural background.Hope you enjoy the drama as much as I did (do).",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

tt5182866,I always start with a 10 rating and deduct stars for things that are not good. The introduction was good and detailed. As the adult version of the female lead tells it with detail. The main part of this series was also kind of detailed but some of it was not realistic. The ending and the unrealistic parts is what made me give it 7 stars otherwise it would have been perfect. The adult female lead her sister bora and her husband taek are shown but sunwoo is only a voice on the cellphone. What happened to the parents of all of these families the oldest was mi ran and according to the time line she would have been 77 years old. Also what happened to the others from the group. The ending was very inconclusive as it did not explain any of this. One of the other reviewers is expecting a 2nd season. I hope they won't be disappointed that there isn't going to be one. This would have netted a 10 rating had the ending been clear and conclusive with no loose end.,neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

This show needs to ranked among the best shows in the world. Before this i had only watched Chernobyl with more than hour long episodes, i had concerns

tt5182866,"A good show makes you think about it even after it has ended.Amongst all Reply series, I watched 1988 first, mainly for the star cast, tho now that I think about it every Reply series had a good cast.After completing all the reply series, I can most confidently say Reply 1988 is the best on the list for many reasons. I have my share of compliments and complaints about this show.1) Firstly the show was mainly focused on bonds between people (neighbors, friends, family, siblings) For me that was an important point why I loved this show. Unlike the previous Reply series where the focus was more on the main leads' life. (I know they showed family bonds and friendship too, but nothing compares to Reply 1988 and also in terms of showing an overall picture of life during a certain period.)
The show portrayed such warmth with all its characters, each scene will make you want to live in 1988 when times were simpler.2) The cast did an amazing job of showing what friendship actually is. It was never cringy or too blunt. Seeing them just leaves you with a sense of peace. Even when Deok-Sun likes someone from the group, the teenage love/crush shown was so innocent that you end up rooting for it.3) The show had such great moments that you will be focused on what happened during 1988/89 rather than present time 2015 where we see an older version of Deok-Sun and Choi Taek.4) I think Lee Il-Hwa and Sung Dong-il had their best roles as parents in 1988 amongst all the reply series.5) In a much larger sense, I feel it was honest of the writers to not show all the characters together in the end, unlike other Reply series.6) I love how in reality it was never a who gets the girl kind of situation ever between Taek and Jung-hwan, there was no pretentiousness between characters, it is heartwarming enough to make you cry when you feel sad for anyone. A true coming of age drama in the times without the internet and people were more connected in real life than in reel life.7) The ending was truly sad, the moment they showed Deok-sun entering that room again that started the whole series, it was as if I never wanted to let go of 1988. Nostalgia in its truest form.Even though I have many more compliments for Reply 1988 I have complaints too.1) Starting with the choice of husband.I loved Choi Taek in the series for how purely innocent and lovable he was, but it's hard to side with a guy who wasn't present for more than or almost 60% of the show. I do think I am biased for Jung-Hwan because I love him. He was perfect in every way and did things for Deok-sun without telling anyone. He gave the worst case of second lead syndrome ever. Now, when I think about any other actor who played a second lead, I don't feel as sad as I did for Jung-Hwan.I really hoped that Deok-Sun would end up with Jung-hwan for honest reasons. They actually made a good pair, and the future husband gave vibes that he is Jung-hwan. They had good chemistry. It was heartbreaking to see Jung-hwan confessing his feelings, later on, only to say he was kidding.The only silver lining is that Hyeri and Jun-yeol are actually dating in real life, and that makes me really happy.2) We did not get any kind of closure for what happened to Jung-Hwan and Dong-Ryong in the end and that breaks my heart.For anyone still thinking about whether to watch 1988 or not, I recommend you do. It will be hard to let go of Reply 1988 even after it has ended, but you will get the feeling of having watched a really amazing show that stays with you. A great overall cast, amazing acting, over-flow of emotions, and second lead syndrome, you name it and Reply 1988 has got it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"I'm not sure what prompted me to just go for this drama that was idly sitting on my Netflix recommendations for ages. That too at a time when I was watching sub-par Western and Asian shows that were doing nothing for me in terms of emotions or meaningfulness. Well damn, did this show change my whole life.First of all, the plot was composed of a series of subplots in every episode that came together to tell an interlinked story of the people within the neighbourhood, complete with a narrated message at the end that ties them together/teaches the audience some sort of lesson. I must admit that this was one of my favourite parts of the show, waiting to hear one of the characters talk about the messages within each episode, and watch it connect to the individual characters' stories at the time. Such a refreshing and heartwarming part of the series.Now, the characters...no words I say will ever do justice to how multi-dimensional and authentic every single character felt. The adults down to the kids all had their own struggles and personal growths, and no one felt like a secondary character or a mere afterthought of the writer. In fact, it blows my mind that every character managed to have their own dreams, personalities and struggles be so beautifully illustrated and in association with each other...it felt so natural and real! I found almost every character to be relatable to me or someone I know, and exposed me to the fact that the human experience in general is an universal one no matter which year you were born in or where in the world you live. The emotions, heartaches, hard work, relationship bonds and successes feel very much the same. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about the characters and their development, right from watching them grow from episode 1 to episode to episode 20.The OST, ahhh the OST. This deserves its own paragraph because of just how beautiful and nostalgic it feels...its been a long time since I watched the drama yet every single time I hear ANY song from the drama, I find myself tearing up or outright bawling. This has never happened to me before haha, the magic of this drama's OST is incomparable and simply magical. Bonus points to the lyrics doing complete justice to those times and moments. Also, the scenes between the ML and FL near the end featured music that was so fitting and beautiful I have no words, like ""In Dreams"" for the moment where they didn't know if what was happening was a dream, to ""Right Here Waiting For You"" when he rushed to her at the concert, to tense music being followed up by ""My Dear, Come Back to Me"" when they finally reveal a major secret and realize their feelings for each other. So masterfully chosen and gave proper justice to those moments...I hope whoever came up with the song choices got a raise!Finally, the realism of it all. Every scene right down to the ending, I loved how raw and warm it felt. Nothing over the top or forced, just pure chemistry between the characters and realistic depictions of life and love. Just like Don't Worry, I really have o regrets with this drama (okay maybe a few more scenes with the leads as a couple because I loved their adorable and healthy relationship so much), right down to not every character showing up to the interview...because thats just how life is. Not everybody (like the parents) may be be alive, or still close or in the same country, etc. And thats okay. What matters are the moments they lived together and the memories thy made. I loved how they kept elements of the ending up to the viewers to decide. Very elegantly concluded. Let's not even get started on the final shots of the ruins of Sssangmundong followed by the flashbacks into the opening scene...simply breathtaking. Left me with the biggest hangover I ever felt.So, I literally rewatched this drama right after away with family. And somehow, it was even better than the first watch. The rewatch value on this show is insane not just because of how any emotions it has the potential to make you feel again, but the hidden hints you notice only on the second time around. So much fun!All in all, this show is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.

tt5182866,"This show is about LOVE, love between friends, love between family members, and the sacrifice parents made out of love for their children. It is heartwarming, nostalgic and at time, hilarious. Overall a good show but I truly do not get the perfect 10 score.Every character has his/her own personality and is enjoyable to watch how they interact through their daily lives. However, one key failure of the show is the main character. I wish the writer could have given the female lead a more in-depth character, to me, Sung Duk-Sun is a kind, happy go lucky, noisy and at times obnoxious, very simple minded girl. She is rather lazy, no motivation and no ambition other than to hit a boy and get married. She is the most unlikable character in the whole show and yet she is the lead! Of her 4 male BFFs, she is interested in 3 of them! She has no preference, whoever wants her is OK with her! As long as one of them scoop her up. She has no focus in life, do not know what she wants to be or make any effort to be useful.My favorite characters are the Moms and Dads, Bora and Sun woo. And I am glad the last episode feature their wedding instead of Duk-Sun & Choi Taek's. The ending is satisfactory as everybody (again, except Duk-san) has made a mark for themselves. Even slow Jung Bong and funny Dong-Ryong have finally found their path.Overall, a good show but to me, a poor lead character is a major flaw.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"Reply 1988 walks in the footsteps of Reply 1997, only focuses more on the family dynamics and the old neighbourhood friendships. However, it wasn't as good as the other reply. The main reason that I preferred the 1997 reply over this, was the duration. The 1988's episodes lasted almost two hours each! And they were twenty of them (kudos to the producers; that must have been a challenge). Maybe for some, that wouldn't be a problem, but I personally prefer my dramas short -er, as it's more easy to watch. And the long duration makes it tiring at some point. Anyway, the 1997 reply's main reason for success was the kpop fangirling, that created laughter. Plus, the romance was quite interesting, as it was mixed up with the back and forth of the story. The Reply 1988 had a nice romance, but it was a little predictable and the chemistry between the two of them wasn't that good (I would have preferred the girl to have ended up with another character, as they looked better together). The family stories were quite good, and for me, were better than the friendship-romance. But, in the end, it was a so so drama, with a story that didn't keep the interest till the end, so 3 out of 10, for the good performances.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

The kids of the Ssamongdong neighborhood are literally inseparable since childhood. They are each other's pillars. These 5 families live through happiness ,joy, laughter as well as difficult times together.This drama evolves in the time when there was no internet and people relied on each other for solace. This drama maintains a subtle balance between comedy and seriousness.It deals with each family's problems and how they overcome it with much help from their loving neighbours.This coming of age drama also deals with how each young character deal with their career, family ,
love life and finally marriage but all the time being there for their friends ,who were inseparable since childhood.One of the most funniest dramas, will make ur day with joy and laughter with every episode .Their bonding is to die for, not only of the kids of the neighborhood but also among their parents , just beautiful .This drama will forever stay in my heart and I can never really say goodbye to Ssmongdong neighborhood .",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

tt5182866,"Reply 1988 is like that average looking sandwich you purchased without much thought from a mom-pop diner, but ends up being the most delicious sandwich you ever tasted. This series began underwhelmingly and sneaks up on you with over-abundance of love, joy, laughter, hope and bittersweet nostalgia.It somehow manages to create a beautiful dichotomy of simplicity in its overall plot with complexity of being human.The main reason Reply 1988 is so amazing is its purposefully segmented shooting/editing style and non-chronological method of story-telling by the writers. Each episode is carefully interwoven with multiple stories but each story does not present itself fully. Rather, each narrative would come to a pause without a resolve then shift onto other narratives before ultimately gently steering the viewers back to the initial narrative. These shifts in stories aren't always chronological yet it doesn't feel jarring when it moves onto another. Instead, it feels like a cleverly way to give each episode a smidge of mystery and allowing viewers to hold onto pieces of the puzzle.On top of the creative storytelling, the astounding acting from the cast helped to make Rely 1988 one of my favourite.Hyeri (who plays Daek Sun) is phenomenal in her subtlety in facial expressions, fearlessness in looking/acting foolish, impactful monologues, compelling inept dancing skills (I honestly believed that she couldn't dance, only to later be pleasantly surprised to then discover Hyeri is this amazing kpop star) and her genuine smiles.Kyung-Pyo, Ryu, Bo-Gum & Dong-hwi (who portrays the main four guys) does an amazing job in capturing their respective characters' with enough slapstick comedy to keep you laughing but also sincerity in their emotions.Ra Mi-ran (who portrays Mi-ran) and Sun-Young are my favourite mothers. These two also aren't afraid of making themselves look ridiculous, which really helped keep the tone of the series.The music and sound effects (baaaaa) also plays a huge part in making Reply 1988 so good. Each song that plays not only keeps in part with the era (1980s/1990s), steeping you further into the time period. The song also cleverly bounces between music in background for mood verses music the characters can hear (for those interested: non-diegetic vs diegetic). Then on top of this, the series use of the sound effect really helps to set the comedic tone.The dialogue also another factor in what made this series great. It was well written and delivered to be tender-hearted, hysterical, manic and loving when it needed to be. The use of voice-over to deliver the underlining theme of the episode is quite impactful.My only complaints are foreign set decor and use of foreign language (an occurrence in many dramas). Whenever this series goes to China, the sets and spoken mandarin really threw a wrench in the enjoyment. The set decor is wildly over populated with ornate patterns and the colour red. It is as if the show was worried we wouldn't understand the fact the characters are in China. Also the heavily accented Mandarin spoken by supposedly fluent Chinese characters was bit of a soreness.Overall, despite minor flaws, Reply 1988 is one awesome wholesome heartfelt show that I plan to rewatch again. Even though it wasn't my culture nor an era I really remember, I felt deep connections with many of the stories that took place. There was so much FEELS in this series that I haven't fully reflected on everything.Highly recommended is an understatement. PLEASE if you ever get a chance...just hit the ""play"" button. You won't regret it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

tt5182866,"The plus side of this series is the sitcom, the greetings, the characters. I laughed so much LOL 😂 at the characters in the series and the way they were portrayed. The minus in this series, as in all k-dramas, is the strict censorship of popular culture products. Only Volvo and Samsung are advertised diligently note! In modern K-dramas, but that's about it. If you watch K-drama in your spare time, you learn to find those brands.Personally, I would have liked to see the products of that era. I sound like a researcher of history or folkloristics, what music did they listen to,
what programs did they watch, who did they really fan, admire? Who will be on the posters? Everything like that was not shown. There were no indications of the West. Coca cola is not even mentioned. Say yes, at that time South Korea seemed like an almost introvert country to me, if you don't count the Olympics.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

It was so precious which we cant find now

Chinchaaaaa ❤❤❤❤❤❤",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"One of the best Korean dramas I have ever seen. One thing is I feel like the translations are not accurate all the time and miss the point for non-Korean speakers. Secondly, Junghwan started liking Deoksun after being pressed up against her so his crush only really started because he became very physically aware that she was a woman. Taek, however, loves Deoksun because she makes him happy and she has always made him happy. She was the only girl that could ever understand him and the only one he could be with. He loved her for everything she was; she was like the Sun to him. I am sure they were very happily married forever. Junghwan could find a lovely woman that is not Deoksun, and I hope he moved on to someone good for him.I also have to praise the acting skills of everyone in this show. I couldn't believe it when I saw actual pictures of the cast in real life! They had completely transformed into people living in the 80's. The storyline following the mothers is a beautiful mess of deep emotions and Korean family values. The neighborhood kids had perfect chemistry and it felt so real. They each embodied their character with everything in them. I cannot believe how good of a show this was and that I've only watched it now.It makes you feel like you are a part of the story, one so realistic you cannot help but feel the pain in each of the characters' hearts. With the passing of years came marked character growth, concluding with an extremely satisfactory ending to a long-winded narrative of a set of families from one neighborhood in Seoul. Awesome creation.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

It's such a feel good show and thinking about when i'll be able to watch it next makes me giddy, which is also rare. I don't watch K-dramas that often anymore as they tend to be pretty slow burn but i'm glad that this show is long as i don't want it to end. I do find Bo-ra ra to be very annoying lol, but i feel like she'll eventually become likeable. I highly recommend everyone watch it as it reminds me of how simple life used to be as a kid. Honestly I love this show so far.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"I started this show on a whim. Honestly thought it would be boring and that I would not like it, especially since I'm not Korean and wouldn't understand the cultural reference. However, I was hooked from the first episode (not in a binge-watch way, but rather that it was sweet and weirdly comforting, like a warm hug). The beauty of youth was beautifully captured-not just the carefree aspects but even the things that are major concerns at that age. I liked that they focused on the relationships/friendships between those in that neighbourhood and not just on a particular couple's romance. I especially loved the last scene where they are all back to the kids we meet in the first episode and ends with the the little kids who became friends. I also love how they showed the what DS goes through as the middle child (even though I'm not one I found that interesting and realistic). I found Jung-Bong and Dong-Ryong, adorable. I also loved Jung-Hwang, though he seemed grumpy and prickly on the outside he was sensitive, attentive, and loving. I especially loved how he doesn't blame fate but has the maturity and insight to realise it was his hesitation and a sum of all the seemingly tiny choices he made.-CONS-That being said, I didn't like the CT was husband in the end. I didn't find the to be a convincing couple. I could see that CT was in love with DS but don't think they portrayed DS being in love with him well. She treated him just like how they others did, sometimes like he was a child or just two children who were friends. Also, though they stated things that were characteristic of CT, the husband looked and acted more like JH. I honestly would have found DS and DR to be a more convincing couple. The show also seemed slow sometimes, not individual scenes, but just overall. I wish they had showed how they all are in the future if they still meet up, stay in touch. JH and DR aren't mentioned in the future, like what they are up to. It might be coz the cut the scene out where JH dies in a plane crash (which I'm glad they did coz he deserved a better ending than that). But they don't mention anything about them at all, which was sad.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5182866,"This series is so comforting man but heartbreaking too. It's funny and emotional too like it's a rollercoaster of emotions someone there is happy but someone sad. This series literally points every relatable things of a middle class family it gives values of everything first of all parents and friends
But Jung hwan ending was so heartbreaking he really became my roman Empire after I got to know that in real life he's dead😭. It also gives precious flashbacks of your childhood. I'm Indian then also I found it relatable to me. It all talks about a real youth like they were neighbours not relatives then also they found their home in each other like how they used to help each other in every ups and downs how they always used to support each other I love this drama but it also made me cry so much. Here everyone acted so real like it didn't felt that it was an acting everything was super suitable like no over drama and all.

tt5182866,"This slice of life series is a balm for the soul, full of raucous bickering, annoyed, clucking women, hapless husbands and childhood friends who live in one another's homes and are high school seniors in 1988.How these friends navigate growing up, falling in love and persisting through hardships is the heart of this drama.The cast is excellent with one exception. Seriously, the kids are charming and unself-consciously unique. The parents funny, loving and overbearing in equal measures. It's really a stunning ensemble cast. I loved almost everyone. The exception is the sneering actress playing Bo-ra, eldest daughter in a family living in reduced circumstances in the basement of their neighbors. She only ever curls her lip to speak, listen or glare. Her one expression is a sneer and I hated looking at her. Yuck. Luckily everyone else is terrific.I loved this for its winsome portrait of life at a specific time and place. It's a story told with great affection and humor.

tt5182866,"Sung Dong Il and Lee Il Hwa are back as parents and there are no cameo appearances from the cast of the previous two seasons except of course the obvious presence of Samcheonpo as Jung Hwan's father.
The cast in this series was by far the best! From the parents to the kids everybody was SO good!
This season too like the previous two tells us the story of a group of friends. These friends live in the same neighborhood and are high school students. This series concentrated on the family more than the love story.
Duk Sun, Sun Woo, Jung Hwan, Choi Taek and Dong Ryong. I love these characters the best. What with Duk Sun crushing on her friends and feeling lost when she can't figure out her feelings. The Baduk champion Taek who can only play Baduk but can't function like a normal human without some help from his friends. Dong Ryong is the 'counsellor' on the block. He's also the singer and dancer in the group who is constantly getting into trouble with his father who is also the dean at his school! Jung Hwan the dog is so tsundere that it warms your heart. He unlike his friends finds it hard to express himself but when it comes to his family he is always found sitting and pondering over how to make things right. Sun Woo! Sun Woo is the sanest person in group. He takes it upon himself to help his mother and is always there for his little sister Jin Joo who is the cutest little marshmallow on the show.
The story revolves around these 5 characters and their respective siblings. It's about a time where parents made their kids take a little something from their table to their neighbors. Back when there were no smart phones and gadgets to keep one occupied.
These 5 come up with such fun ways of keeping themselves entertained it is nothing short of nostalgia mixed with a longing for a world when things were much simpler.
The only reason why this doesn't get a perfect score is because the guy I was rooting for deserved to be with Duk Sun!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"

tt5182866,"'Reply 1988' is a 20-episode long Korean drama, starring Hyeri, Park Bo Gum, Ryu Jun Yeol in pivotal roles. The show is about five teenage friends, whose families live together in the same neighborhood. The whole show is set in and around the year '88, thereby explaining the title. This drama is the 3rd instalment in the Reply series. I was very excited to watch this show because of the craze surrounding the earlier two, and without doubt 'Reply 1988' managed to steal my heart. This show is top-notch in everything. Right from the acting, to the 'oh-so-good' OST, to the nostalgic feel of the late 80s and 90s, everything in this show is awesome. This show gives apt meaning to each letter of the word 'PERFECT'.If I start writing about the 'mention-deserving' performances of the actors, then I will never be able to finish writing this thing. Each and every, I repeat, E-A-C-H and E-V-E-RY person is a gem in this drama. Be it the free-spirited and kind-hearted Sung Duk Seon (played by Hyeri), the stoic and sarcastic Kim Jung Hwan (played by Ryu Jun Yeol) or the cute little Jin-joo, each and every actor has lived their role. The dedication with which everyone performed their act has beautified the show, enormously.Next, talking about the OST of the drama, it is yet another masterpiece. The show has got some really good songs which carry all kinds of emotions throughout the episodes. 'Don't Worry Dear' by Lee Juck, is my favorite song from this drama. 'Everyday With You' by Sojin, 'Hyehwadong' by Park Bo Ram, 'Youth' by Kim Feel, are also some of the songs from the drama that are worth mentioning.Talking about the overall story of the drama, it delivers a sweet insight into the lives of the people in the neighborhood. The emotional care and love that the people share in between is seldom seen in today's neighbors. Each and every episode has a sweet message hidden in it which is brimmed by emotions. This show has the ability to make you laugh like a maniac at one instant or cry like a baby at the other. Generally, I get really pissed off when episodes exceed the 1 hour duration, but this drama is an exception. Even though each episode is more than 1 hour long, and near the ending the duration elongates to nearly 2 hours, it is all forgivable, because trust me, in the end, you are going to find yourself begging for more. I recommend everyone to watch this very precious show because believe me, you are not going to regret it at all. And by chance, if this review encourages you to watch this drama, then get ready to thank me after finishing the show ;-) .",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Family"
tt5320412,"This is definitely one of the best k-dramas I've seen, but be warned if you aren't used to the Korean way of story telling. There are certain clichés in every k-drama, including this one, that may look strange to you at first: 1) Love Triangle: there is always a lover who sits and watches the love of his life fall for the lead actor; 2) Extended close ups: characters stare at each other for a very long time until the music stops; 3) The Wrist grab: they have all kind of meanings like ' just stop' , 'don't go,'you're mine'; 4) Drunkeness: usually a heartbroken character trying to kill the pain inside; 5) Accidental kisses: the lovers accidentally fall or bump into each other; 6) Raining or snowing scene: probably good for dramatic and cinematic effect; 7)Secrets & Lies: the lovers hide certain facts from each other, because they don't want to hurt each others feelings, making things worse; 8)Sickness & Health: characters nurse their loved ones personally back into health; 9) The back hug or piggy back: the male gives the female a heartfelt back hug or carries her on his back, when she's injured or tired, or just to be sweet; 10) Separations: lovers have to be separated, always one of them leaves, sometimes without notice; 11)Kissing Scene shot from several camera angles: sex is only implied,never shown in k-drama, all we get is The Kiss; 12) Cliffhangers: in order to hook you every single episode.Are you still there? Then you will be rewarded with feisty girls, pretty boy actors (flower boys), excellent cinematography, catchy music scores and sweeping stories like Moon Lovers.The plot: During a total eclipse of the sun, a 25-year-old 21st century woman, Go Ha-jin (Lee Ji Eun), is transported back in time to Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year 941, in the body of 16-year-old Hae Soo and there, she encounters the many royal princes of the ruling family. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm 8th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), and later with Wang So (Lee Joon Gi), the mutilated 4th Prince who hides his scarred face behind a mask. He's surnamed ""wolf dog"", because he had to fight wolves when he was still young and was treated badly as a hostage. Now he likes to foster his image as a fearsome beast. There's a fight for the throne going on. Hae Soo finds herself caught between it all. Thanks to her history lessons at school she comes to realize Wang So will win this battle finally. He'll become the future king of Goryeo, and a bloody tyrant at that. Soo loves So, but she also fears him. Can she change her lover into a better ruler in time? The Good: The first meeting of the 'Moon Lovers', Hae Soo and Wang So, sets the tone for the whole series: old fashioned romance but a love that hurts. There's the black Wolf Prince riding his war horse, first endangering Hae Soo but saving her as well by lifting her in the saddle in front of him. Then there's the extended closeup of their faces, sitting opposite each other, bouncing up and down, having their eyes on each other while the music plays their love theme. The next scene he seems afraid of his own feelings and So drops Soo to the ground. Their love is painful, literally.Leading man Lee Joon Gi is simply the best actor available for that kind of TV making. The minute he appears on the screen I am glued to his face and facial expressions despite his mask, that renders all kinds of emotions like joy, pain, embarrassment, hate. Notwithstanding his well performed fighting scenes, he's in danger of becoming a modern Rudolph Valentino, with female fans only. I hope he'll get the chance to proof himself in less romantic roles playing more tormented characters like the lead in Man on High Heels (2014)for example.The Bad: Moon Lovers is a remake of the Chinese series 'Scarlet Heart' with 35 episodes. The original version could handle all the princes and their love interests. The Korean production however should have cut some story lines to flesh out the characters of Soo and So, who are the protagonists, giving them more time to develop their romance. Now we were misled thinking Wang Wook was Soo's Prince Charming. Kang Ha Neul gives a stunning performance, so it was no punishment to watch him stealing screen time from Lee Joon Gi. But the story lines became too difficult to tell, leaving plot holes until the very end. Also there are still questions unanswered: is this all about(moon)love? Or altering history? Who knows?Nevertheless I would highly recommend this series. I was hooked for 20 episodes, hoping for a sequel.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"I am no fan of Korean TV series but I took an exception in watching since the plot was very complicated taking a step back in time. It took me awhile to feel comfortable watching since it took a lot of effort in reading subtitles while internalizing the dialogue. But right after Episode 2, I was totally hooked. I couldn't stop with just 1 episode a night and had the craving to just watch all 20 episodes in 2 nights!! Scarlet Heart Ryeo has just begun airing in the Philippines but I have access to the original version with English subtitle, which I prefer. It was giving me a headache listening to the Tagalog translation. Besides, it was more heart-wrenching hearing their original voices. So, as a fan of the Scarlet Heart Ryeo series, I hope that a Scarlet Heart Ryeo 2 is up for an international showing SOON. It may not have been a hit in South Korea but I hope that the producers seek the comments from the international audience for an unbiased feedback.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I was really hoping for a happy ending, but towards the end the story was just getting worse and worse. This must be the saddest drama I've ever seen. There are some really sad events earlier in the drama, but last part is just tragic. Usually, when a drama ends like that, it makes me hate the whole story. But this one is just so good, that I still love it. Overall, the story was amazing and I love that ending was connected to the beginning.

Scarlet Heart has no shortage of villains, all the actors and actresses playing their roles magnificently 'til the end.Warning: This drama is not for the weak-minded and fainthearted.Overall: Good acting, good story, good soundtrack, good chemistry between the leads, good fight sequences, good cinematography, based on historical events (but filmed with liberty).I was hooked from start to finish, left with just one wish... that the director and staff have mercy and finally grace us with those precious deleted scenes!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

It's already months ago when this drama ended but I'm here, still searching updates about them and wanting to watch it again. I also watched this on a live stream and I don't understand anything what they're saying but based on their emotions, I feel that I know what's really going on. I'm even more emotional when I watched them like that. The acting is super b! I'm very impressed to all the actors especially Lee Joon Gi, who I know is very perfect on every korean historical dramas and Kang Ha Neul, who gave me goosebumps with his acting. Also, the other actors did a great job. The stage production and costumes will make you thought if this is a TV or a film production. 10/10 for me!When I'm currently watching this, I'm kinda disappointed to myself because I think back then, ""Why I am only watching this now? I should watched this before anything else"" That really make me regret back then lol-If you'll be watching this, brace yourself with a lot of emotions. You may find this a cute love story with a love triangle going on, but when the story goes on, a tragic moments happening and you may curse a lot of people when the Princes begins to battle for the throne. You'll find whose greedy and not. What they priorities most. Love or Power? Family or Love?I hope you'll enjoy watching this bcoz I never forget this one and it will be remembered as one of the best. On all dramas I watched, they were on my top 3 list. The ending may not as you expected as similar as the original series ""Scarlet Heart"" from China. But it's a good ending I think it's better that way that they didn't copy the exact ending happened on the original series. BTW, Lee Joon Gi mentioned that it's impossible to have a season 2, who knows. Maybe a miracle happened.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

The actors have a great chemistry together,and i will like to find out other movies or settings they had made before Moon Lovers! The landscapes and locations are fantastic,the battle scenes were like watching a well made action movie with great battle choreography. I was surprised from the costumes and fashion of the era that were Amazing,and most of all the plot is breathtaking! I can't hide that I cried many times over the 20 episodes i saw in just 5 days time! I recommend it to everyone,and i hope that there will be a second season!!!

tt5320412,"This drama absolutely Broke me. I feel Like I will NEVER recover from this show. I Loved it, I Hated it, It Hurt, It completely Broke me But the Love was EVERYTHING. I binge watched this entire show of 20eps in one go. It left me a crying sobbing mess. I cried an ocean of tears. Let me say I went into this Drama knowing absolutely nothing . I wish I would have known beforehand that it wasn't an HEA (by MY Standards), Because then maybe I could have better prepared my heart for all this damage. ( My Drama BFF recommended it to me and ohhhhhh man I should charge her for emotional damage lol) I give it a 9/10 That cliffhanger ending just wasn't fair, I definitely needed more. This ending absolutely destroyed me and I will never be over it or forgive them for doing us this dirty. This Drama pulled so many emotions from me. And for a show to really have such a huge impact on your emotions, to bring out all these feelings an have you so immersed, it's a 10. The Love was pure and unconditional, The relationships were unlike anything I've ever come across. (these bonds were just so special) you really feel the friendship and the love that each of the princes had with HaeSoo, it was very remarkable. The Drama... The Drama was overwhelming and unmatched! The anguish left me broken beyond repair. Y'all this seriously broke me! I was not okay for days. Initially it was a show that gave me a ""I can't say that I hated it but I can't say that I loved it"" because it seriously put me through a $hit show of emotions. I had the biggest hangover/hangarround from this show, I couldn't get into anything for a bit. It was unforgettable, this show and these characters are just so memorable, and their love will leave a lasting impression on your heart. It's definitely a MUST watch. I highly recommend it. It's a top drama for me with a HUGE Emotional damage warning.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"I donot know how I really feel about this serial. It started off pretty well. The story line and the character development of Soo and So made sense. But I dont know if this is me but sometimes there are loopholes in Korean serials. Like characters show really exaggerated reactions to mere things which ends up changing the storyline very radically. Like Wang so's reaction to finding out that Soo had loved Wook at one point was far too exaggerated and so was Soo's unwillingless to mend their misunderstanding. I can understand why Soo wanted to leave the palace, the king was changing into the man she feared he would become, the Queen's relationship with him as well as her increasing loneliness, but still i felt that her reaction to her servants death felt a bit exaggerated.At times I also struggled with Soo's character, She was shown to be a hot headed girl who was outspoken and bold in the beginning but soon it transformed into a typical Mary sue who was everyone's savior and was flawless.I think the main fault of Soo was refusal to marry the King, In the goodness of her heart she made the first move to priortise the throne over their relationship and I think that is where the conflicts started.
I also felt that there were too many questions which were left unanswered, Why had Soo timetravelled? Who was the astronomer and how did he appear in the end? Why did Wang So's mother hate him- I mean his abuse at the hands of family was an important part of the story but the cause of his mom's resentment was never explained...? The last episode also felt poorly directed with chunks and bits and pieces from the past mixing into the present. I felt that the resolution was never reached and as an audience i didnot feel satisfied with the ambigous decalaration of the king that "" He will find her again""
The one thing which does make this series worth watching is Joon Gi lee's acting. It is perfect. From his tranformation from a cruel warrior to that of a lover to that of a blood thirsty king, everything is perfect. 
In the end I would say that with better direction and better script handling this could have been a much more amazing serial. I guess a season 2 could do a better job of satisfying the audience :/",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

Few plot holes and I wished the ending had been better.And speaking of ending, for some reason it left me in a depressing disposition. Possibly because they tried to get it as close to true events, so the characters who would have made this series a happy ending are really non-existent so they had to get rid of them before the series end. Too much death and sadness.

I loved the part of Baekhyun as Wang Eun. Hes very cute and his acting is also very cute and emotional. All the actors are extra smart with great attitude. All the couples had great chemistry. The dressing of the actors and actress and their hairstyle is gorgeous. There were some scenes still hanging so it's better to have season2. That would make the drama perfect.

Many scenes are heartbreaking, if you follow the plot your emotions will be stirred up.

Quite honestly, the show's only redeeming quality is its male lead, who really manages to mesmerize the audience to the point that some of them even graded the show with 10/10. Otherwise, a show full of plot holes where the colourless female lead only pays attention to the male lead in the last episodes after spending almost the whole show pining over his self righteous brother would have never been classified as ""epic romance"".

tt5320412,"This drama turned out to be a reverse harem in disguise. A handful of princes with varied flavors happened to meet a mentally handicapped girl to start their quest of hunting this wild female from a different timeline. All of these princes have the edgiest troubled teens behaviors with a mix of daddy/mommy issues. Out of all of them, the male lead took the edge in being the ultimate dark and mysterious bad boy, literally. Zooming out, all of this was done for a trail of pathetic emotional baits with no substance, they were begging the viewers for pity points. The moment the female lead knew about them, she approached every single one with the mentality of ""I can fix him"". While the princes were intentionally irrecoverably broken by the writer to serve a purpose for the female lead, she equally had her own set of problems. Within the span of a few episodes she became weirdly too attached to all of them and going even further to offer sacrifices, while neglecting her brief arrival and the fact that she was transferred to the past, but I guess shirtless bois are irresistible. The romantic entanglements in general were agonizing to tolerate, it kept you wishing the worse for all of them. Although it was bad as is, but why did they decide to make it worse with each passing episode in the second half? It's just too painful knowing the writer is making fun of us. At least the cinematography was okay and I watched it on BluRay.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5320412,"An unexpected drama that lives up to it's expectations. No wonder why it is still on the ""hot to watch"" lists even it ended months ago! Well, the story is about a girl who dies in a lake accident and she magically goes back in time, during the kingdom period, where she takes the body of a lady. She develops strong relationships with the princes of the dynasty, and the drama focuses on her story and how she enters the palace as a court lady and her relationship with the fourth prince, who is described as a wolf. All in all, I really loved her story, though I did find some disadvantages. First of all, the coming ""back"" from the future didn't really work, though it was forgotten after the second episode and it was only revisited in the last episode. Also, the comic acts were not that good, and they made the drama a little silly. Plus, the romance was strong, but I felt that the chemistry was lucking, though I did like the fact that she didn't develop feelings for the prince from the start, as it would have made the drama dull (twenty episodes long already it would have been tiring to watch if the romance had started from episode four!). Another thing that is only my personal opinion is that the male lead didn't work for me. As I'm not his biggest fan, I didn't quite identify with the romance, as he looked rather cruel at times and like a child in others, not to mention the ""You are only mine"" possessiveness didn't work for me at all! However, I did enjoy this drama. The performances were okay (the first episodes were a little awkward though), the costumes and the settings were breathtaking and the action and royal twists were enough to keep the interest high till the very end. Another plus was that the lead lady's character was well developed, as you could she her growing up from a bold girl to a respected head court lady.

tt5320412,"I absolutely love K-Dramas but I came late to the party. I think I would have enjoyed this if I had watched it before Mr. Queen, but having watched it shortly after watching Mr. Queen, Oy! I found it almost unwatchable at times.I can see why people fell in love with it. Compared with other historical dramas, it probably stands up well against them. But Mr. Queen makes this look like it's well over a decade old... It happens in music, something new comes out that exposes the lack of sincerity in what came before, i.e. Disco music, 80's Heavy Metal music, they had no life outside the decades they were born in.Moon Lovers is well acted, the costumes, the settings, the scenery, they're beautiful, but there are lots of plot holes. I think the writing is a bit bloated. As a viewer, I can't help but feel manipulated by forced twists and turns. Twist and turns are great, but not when they don't move organically with the rest of the story.I think the hardest part to deal with is the flippant, disorienting approach to life the main character, Hae Soo takes. As a character in that situation-especially when compared to Mr. Queen-her actions often don't make sense. She's brilliant one moment and the next she's ignorant and reckless. While somehow she blends in almost seamlessly with everyone even though she's from 1,000 years in the future...I think IU did well with what she had but the character was poorly written.Moon Lovers is a great, absurd, very sad, fantasy, but it pretends not to be absurd... and strangely, it feels like it tries not to be a fantasy.

She is such a good actress, but the character made no sense to me.The rivalry for the throne and power between sibling/half siblings is a common trope in many period dramas, but they've never portrayed the hate and jealously so badly. I watched till 14 episodes and couldn't bear to finish it.

tt5320412,"When a show makes you 100% invest in the story, the characters and what happens next, that are signs of a great show. SHR did that excellently from the very beginning til the end.For me, the best Moon Lovers has achieved was the plot, casting and especially the soundtrack. Easily one of the best K-Drama OSTs in the past 10 years, the track for every scene was on point.The screenplay was well-paced, well-written (in comparison to many peers in the same genre), and will keep you on the edge of your seat in many episodes, while left you in an emotional rollercoaster in others. I can't think of a better cast than IU as Hae Soo and Lee Joon Gi for Wang So (4th Prince), both perfect for their roles.But the show does not come without flaws. For me, the biggest let down was the directing. 9/10 times the camerawork was really just (very) close shot of the actors/actresses' faces (sometimes almost cut their face in half on screen!), and most conversations happen as in 2 character just stands there face-to-face, similar to a stage play. This felt cheap and unimaginative for a big budget hit and does horribly to IU and Baek Hyun (10th Prince) because it exposed their inexperience in acting, especially IU.For IU's acting which received much criticism back in Korea: in general she really was not that bad, while the first half of the show was underperforming, you can clearly see the improvement in IU's acting in later episodes where a more difficult emotional range was required of her. On the other hand Lee Joon Gi was consistently outstanding as Wang So.IU's character development was also questionable at times. Hae Soo in the first episodes of the serie and in the original book version was a clever, characteristic, independent and energetic girl who keep up with her new life with wits and courage. In later half of the serie she is pretty much reduced to an eye candy who cries a lot. Sure there are still ""Hae Soo moments"" but they are mostly dwarfed by a dampen version of her. But I'll let this slide since I think it could be realistic part of her spending more time of her life intertwined with the palace's power struggles.Another highlight is the great production. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, especially the sites inside the palace. The rooms, outdoor filming places, props and clothing felt genuine and of high quality, there's very little CGI. Everything did well to add to the emotions of the story.However, in spite of its flaws, I'd recommend this show to anyone who is fond of K-Drama. As a drama lovers, you should not look too much into certain cinematic aspects, but appreciate the great emotional and entertainment value it brings: and Scarlet Heart Ryeo was one of the best in achieving just that.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

Unlike most people I found the ending satisfying, it was intense but a series like this wouldn't end any other way in my opinion. And like everyone else, I'm rooting for season 2 too.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,Actually It's a worth watching series.At first I didn't show any interest in this because it was a historical drama but when I saw that I literally found that it was an awesome series..,positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"I heard so many good feedback about this drama and finally I decided to give it a try. What to say? This drama blows my mind.The plot is very interesting with so many different characters. Each of these personalities is very important for the whole plot and you never get bored.The costumes are beautiful, great cinematography. And the music / OST (original soundtrack) is virtuous. I think it is the most beautiful drama music I ever heard. It touches your soul, and you can listen to forever.Very good choice for the cast. All actors are great. IU (as Hae Soo) and Lee Joon Gi (as 4th Prince) have amazing chemistry.It is very romantic drama, full of emotions and tears. The 15th episode is very sad. So, the last one, too. You need tissues because you will cry your eyes out.Most beautiful historical drama I ever watched. I have big interest for history and the drama made me research and read historical books about the Goryeo era.The drama is unforgettable masterpiece. , 10/10 for it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5320412,"I love the way they made Hae Soo the imaginary character fit so perfectly into the real story of Goreyo dynasty. First they made up a story on one of the most powerful kings of Goreyo and through this Hae Soo characters help they told the real story of the 4th king Gowangju.
There might not be such a figure like Hae Soo in history but who bothers as the real story is from the year 980.
It was full of entertainment. Consistency of the characters build up was commendable.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"The drama is average at best and is simply an inferior adaptation of the original. The main male lead basically carried this show while the female lead is average at best.The show tried to be funny and then the next scene switch 180 degrees into seriousness which is jarring. The overuse of close-up on the actors faces is annoying and a strange choice.IU has charisma but whenever she tries to act cute I can't help but slightly cringe, rather ironic since she has an adorable face. When the plot calls for her to be a sophisticated and graceful woman, the end result is also not at all convincing. IU can act as demonstrated in My Mister but her range is rather limited. This is an opinion taken into account her 'recent' work like Hotel De Luna which she also received a lot of praise, probably by her bazillions of fans with rose-tinted glasses.The OST elevated this show several notches, because without it I doubt people will look back at this show with such nostalgia.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"When a total eclipse of the sun takes place, Hae-Soo (IU) travels back in time to the Goryeo era. There, she falls in love with Wang So (Lee Joon-Gi) who makes other people tremble with fear. It captured me from the very beginning. She ends up in the Princes outdoors bathing room. A naturally heated pool where the Princes cleansed themselves and bathed in the natural springs. They were shocked when she appeared there. Seems like her spirit went into the body of another woman who had possibly drowned there.She has come from another time so she in independent and outspoken, thus surprising the group of of 8 surviving Prince's who are used to more subdued woman.Prince Wang Baek-Ah the 13th Prince loves the wife of his brother the 8th Prince. He plays his instruments for her and writes poems and paints pictures for her but never unseemly or rude or steps over the line. The 8th Prince is so loving to his wife who is sickly. Hae Soo is getting closer and closer to the 8th Prince. She makes his heart flutter.The first set of assassins sent to kill the Crown Prince had no tongues. So could not told them who sent them but they were still all killed by them then 3rd Prince who sent them. The 4th Prince has already worked out who sent the assassins. It was his own mother. I knew it was something to do with his mother why he slaughtered all those monks and burnt their monastery to the ground. They were the assassins sent to kill his brother. So he wasted all of them. He killed them because he knew it was his mother who sent the assassins. No-one knew it was him who did killed them.. He went in the night and told her his mother. He killed them all so that she could never ask them to do the same thing again.Then Haesoo's cousin Park Si-eun as Lady Hae was the 8th prince Wang Wook's wife and Hae Soo's cousin dies and she is left alone. She is ordered to marry the King as an alliance with her cousins family but she cuts her own arm with a shard from a vase she breaks and avoids the marriage but most of the Prince's are in love with her. They are so happy she didn't marry their father and instead becomes a Court Lady under concubine Oh. She and Court Lady Oh are the kings favourites.Lee Joon-Gi/4th Prince. Wang So, he is the grouchiest and the most arrogant he's always telling Haesoo off but deep down he has and unwavering affection for her. He shows her around his favourite hidden places in the palace gardens and warns her not to trust anyone. He has a certain commanding presence that scares all his brothers. He watches over Hae Soo from a distance and interferes when he see anyone mess with her. He tells everyone she is his woman and no-one is allowed to touch her.The crown Prince Kim San-Ho / 1st Prince Wang Moo the Crown Prince has a variety of aliments and infections on his body like boils or allergy rashes. Hae Soo from modern times knows how to help him. He learns to trust Haesoo medications.A general Sung Dong-il as General Park Soo-kyungand his Tomboy daughter Z Hera/Park Soon Deok [Park Soo Gyeong's Daughter of the General. She has loved 10th Prince Wang Eun from childhood and got to be his wife. Has arrived at the palace. It was not easy for her to get the Prince to love her back as he already loved Hae Soo. The General has been the 4th Prince. Wang So, mentor and teacher. Especially teacher of the Martial Arts. His daughter has the same skills. He has a love for the Prince So and is his greatest supporter. Park Soon Deok was funny when she asked her husband will she get pregnant after they were kissing for the first time. General Park Soo-kyung was the one that taught Wang So martial arts but both of them did not tell anyone about it. He was a mentor to Wang So and protected him with his army secretly. He knew that Wang So was a clever, resourceful and dauntless person. He made sure to be close to him when he was in the palace as Wang So had enemies there, They admired each other. He also taught his daughter :Z Hera/Park Soon Deok at the same time that is why she was so strong.Lee Joon-Gi/4th Prince. Wang So horse riding skills are phenomenal and he takes her (Hae Soo) away with him for an all night ride all the way to the seashore to watch the sunrise. There is something noble and majestic about this guy on a horse. He rides so well! He rides so well! The beginning sequel to the drama showcases his outstanding horsemanship. So love it.She is the only one he can trust or confide in. Episode 11-12 is hard to take when he knowingly drinks the poisoned tea meant for the Crown Prince and he almost dies. He was trying to save Hae Soo and the Crown Prince but she was still imprisoned and tortured. His character is really a sweetheart and so genuine in his conversation and his feelings but pressured by external events and politics. He falls deeper and deeper in love with her because of her great compassion, sympathy and caring nature. This is why as viewers we love this drama so much. Lee Joon Gi acting as Wang So the 4th Prince brings a heart felt dimension to this character that moves us so much as the viewer. So we watch this over and over just to see his wonderful portrayal of this outstanding character that he has brought to life in our hearts and minds. We love him, LJG so much for his outstanding, excellent and remarkable acting skills and creating this overwhelming character that has stole our minds and hearts.Kang Ha-Neul 8th Prince Prince Wang Wook finds out that it was Kang Han Na/Princess Hwang Bo Yun Hwa (8th Prince Wang Wook's younger sister) who was one of the conspirators of the poisoning. She tells him she did it for him because she want him to be king. He kills the only witness to her conspiracy because he doesn't want his mum and his sister to be involved in an investigation. He lost my support at that moment. He said to his sister"" From this moment on you are not my sweet sister. You are a debtor. You to me. Me to you."" He had never wanted to be King up to this point but after this incident he changed.Since no one can save Hae Soo, Woo Hee Jin/Oh Sang Goong hatches a pan to save her. Lady Oh was once the Kings lover but because of her low status she was unable to be the Kings Queen but came to the Palace to be close to him. She is very sick and close to dying. Hae Soo has been looking after her. She has a stomach cancer. She feel like a mother towards Hae Soo. She knows all the in's and out's of palace life and politics. She has been there a long time. She understands the Princes better than anyone. She tells the King it was her who poisoned the Crown Prince because she lost her baby and envied that the Crown Prince lived and her child died. The King says he knows she is just trying to save the girl. She say that Hae Soo is innocent and she would rather it be her than the girl. Lady Oh was Hae Soo's role model and exemplar and she ended up in a similar role to her. Unable to marry the King because of her low status.Ten years before someone send her poison and she miscarried the Kings baby. So just 10 years earlier her and the king were still sleeping together. She is a concubine. She tells the King she doesn't want to lose another child to Queen Yoo. She Lady Oh will takes the place of Hae Soo and dies for her. When the King dies his last thoughts were for her.When Hae Soo was about to be killed who came, not the 8th Prince whom she was waiting for, but the one who truly loved her.Wang So came to the hanging of Hae Soo and fought the guards. Just an order came from the King to say that the real culprit was found. The real cover up by Lady Oh.Hae Soo went outside the Kings residence to kneel to beg for Lady Oh life to be spared. She is already in a weakened state after being tortured. Looks like she has sustained a deep injury to her leg. The Nam Joo-Hyuk 13th Prince Wang Wook (Baek-A) comes to talk to her but she doesn't listen. He tells her Lady Oh is doing this to save her and she is just angering the King. He said he'll go prepare medicine for her and she asks for the 8th Prince but he is forced to abandon her because of what he knows. She's been kneeling for two days without food and water. The rain comes. Everyone has been forbidden by the King to help her. Who comes to her aid(again) to shelter her with his cloak and stand with her in the rain none other than the one that loves her the most and will risk his life and the wrath of the King ............ Yes who else but Lee Joon-Gi/4th Prince,Wang So. While others stand aside and watch. 8th Prince Wang Woo walks away. I think that this was Wang So's greatest moment in this drama. I was so proud of him. The two youngest Princes were kneeling to the side. After that Wang So was send away as an ambassador to Jin as punishment for assisting Hae Soo but asked for her to be taken care of. He loved his freedom roaming as an ambassador. When he left left what happened Has was kicked out of the palace and became a village washer woman to support herself.I hated and detested the character of Park Ji Young/Dowager Empress Yoo (Tae Jo's 3rd Queen and mother of the 3rd Prince, 4th Prince and 14 Prince ). This evil queen wanted Goryeo to belong to one of her sons. She got her wish but it went to the son that she had disowned. Karma gets you. She'll do anything to put her son on the throne. She even stopped to gloat when the Lady Oh was being lead away to her execution because Lady Oh was her greatest rival and the Kings confidant. The King loved Lady Oh.As soon as Lee Joon-Gi/4th Prince,Wang So left the palace Hae Soo was kicked out by the King. She becomes a Gyobang water maid doing washing.A year later when Wang So comes back and finds Have Soo gone he refuses to do what the King has asked him to do. He goes straightaway to find her at her job, to hug her and greet her and tell her that he missed her. She makes him take off the mask that he has been wearing again. He is so demanding and never lets her do her own thing.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5320412,"I would definitely recommend watching this! All the princes who are brothers, some with other mother's since there were concubines back then make this whole drama. They are so fun to watch when they are together on screen. They really developed each prince nicely so you felt like you were attached to each of the characters. IU was perfect in her role as the love interest. Each of the princes have their own relationship and set of feelings for her which was one of my favorite parts. Of course there are the not so nice prince and 1 princess. The cinematography is so beautiful, the costumes are stunning and I've really come to love the Kdramas that are set way back in time. The first half of the series is lighter and unfolds all the storylines and the second half turns darker and almost gut-wrenching at times.I would probably consider myself a Kdrama expert and of course Joon-gi Lee is a favorite. His acting in this is superb. I won't give away the ending, because unfortunately someone told me the ending before I watched it. Don't you hate that?! The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I am super picky about which shows I give that last star to. You will absolutely fall in love with this drama.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

We all know that there are a lot of tragedies in history so it is kind of hard to make a happy ending story in any background from the far away past. Definetely a 10* drama but i watch tv series in order to forget about my real life problems, this is the reason I like happy endings.

To those who are going to watch this please keep in mind dont trust anyone in this. At some point I felt that it is just a story about traitors. The ending just makes no sense. The female lead fell in love with one prince then she went to other one and finally an unexpected turn. In my opinion it is the ending that ruins the whole drama. But the actors were great and the ost too. At first liked this drama so much i even cried when Prince eun died. But after that everything took a whole new turn. Everybody dies in this and the ending i don't know anything about it.

tt5320412,"A power packed drama with an amazingly amazing cast, storyline and OST(which can save the whole Goryeo itself).This show has drawn an unusual amount of discussion and fannish activity, especially internationally (ML poorly received in Korea, but it was an international sensation.) and you will know why.Adaptation: Its an adaptation of a chinese series named ""Scarlet Heart"" which is an adaptation of the Chinese novel ""Bu Bu Jing Xin"".Characters-One of my favourite things about this drama is that each and every character developed and changed with the course of events that occur in their life, and it's one of the best but most heart breaking as well.Every character is important here The King, The queen, prince, princess, handmaids everyone.You can't judge any character here because he/she is fighting for his/her own existence or you can say survival.""Survival is a basic instinct"" theory applies here.Acting- A multi starrer drama and everyone's contribution was perfect. Noone will disappointed you.Now lets talk about Lee Joon Gi, the character of Wang So(4th prince), he is so complex and so hard to deliver but he plays him so effortlessly. I can't imagine any other actor playing this role, Wang So was simply..addictive!IU, the FL conveyed her emotions perfectly and on point, I don't know why people didn't like her.Baekhyun- ahhh! He is a cutiepie.Moral: This drama taught me a very important lesson i.e in life there are no black and white characters, everyone is in the shades of 'grey'.This drama contains all the genre and moods, if you like bromance watch this drama, if you like drama where characters fight with their pasts or the devil inside you should watch it, if you like heartbreaks watch this drama.I am not going to talk about the ending because I HATE to give spoilers.But here's the bottom line: This drama is an acquired taste. If you're not a fan of tragedy or bloodbath look elsewhere.I enjoyed this drama more than anyother dramas I have seen thus far. I am still not over this drama..I was zoned out for atleast a week after completing it.I'd strongly recommend this drama to everyone, regardless of your favorite genre.

Make me to feel like all this situations happening in real time and life , like they were real people and not only characters of a k-drama.

The characters are all well portrayed, excellent acting fron the lead actor Lee Joon Gi who plays the 4th Prince. His gazes and facial expressions are just amazing in this role. The other princes are also deserving of praise for their supporting roles, also all very well portrayed. The lead actress was adequate for her young character.
The romance, my God the love and intense romance is palpable! A splash of chivalry, lust, brotherhood, betrayal, and regrets to make it all come together.
I would've preferred a different ending, seriously it wouldn't kill the writers to give us a happy one!
Overall, a very memorable drama series, addictively good and a must watch. In my opinion it's better than Legend of the Blue Sea which was also made the same year and also won awards that should've gone to this drama.
Also, a very good sound track to compliment the drama!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

In all honesty only one concept of it could attract me . Because of its romantic shots I recommend it but it's not played out for the other aspects of the film. For example : the reality of seniority for castle personnel has not been demonstrated properly and some times you may get the impression of.script discontinuity. By and large should you ask me about it I would strictly recommend you watching it for it's stupendous aspects i.e perfect performance of its major cast (lee goo gi) and it's priceless background music for its emotional shots.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I was hooked from the first episode, kept me looking forward to the next episode. There was never a dull moment. There was one time I was crying back to back with my sister while watching in bed. The plot broke me esp for Prince Wang So, a misunderstood character by the others. I got depressed after I finished the show. I was so traumatized that I was unable to watch K series afterwards(2016-2019). I just returned watching in 2020.I tried rewatching the series and the effect was still the same. Lee Jung Gi did a wonderful job in the portrayal of the character. I hope, if there us a season 2...that the same actors will play for the character.Please watch Scarlett Heart:Ryeo. You will never regret watching each episode.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"The first time I saw Lee Jun Ki and IU together on screen, I was hooked by their chemistry. I knew that no matter how others felt about the character of Hae Soo/Ha Jin growing closer to Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha Neul), that the real romance would be between Hae Soo and Prince Wang So. And they did not disappoint me. This is a couple who will sweep the viewer away.This drama follows the character of Go Ha Jin as she lives out the life of Lady Hae Soo in tenth century Goryeo. The beginning episodes start out innocently enough as she befriends a few of the younger princes and gets into a scrape or two. Along the way she finds herself attracted to her benefactor, Prince Wang Wook, and while struggling with her heart starts to get the dangerous and cautious Prince Wang So to slowly open up to her. Only, this innocence doesn't last long with the death of Lady Hae, she finds that she is no longer protected from treachery. Ha Jin/Hae Soo must learn to navigate the royal waters of the palace, betrayal, and deep loss as she finds that the more she depends on Wang So the more her heart breaks.I recommend keeping a box of Kleenex around while watching the later episdoes. I felt hope and pain for So and Soo. You will root for them all the way. I will warn the viewer, the final episodes will need two boxes and a strong drink to ease the pain, but this drama is worth it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"It's a REALLY good drama, but if you need a happy ending (like myself) you should stop watching at around 50 minutes on the 17th episode. Not all the characters will be happy, by at least the main couple will be.
Otherwise at the end every single person is mostly just surviving, which is more realistic but also depressing.To those who are not satisfied with the ending: apparently there should've been an extra few seconds at the end, you can find it online. It's a scene where the main character receives a handkerchief from someone (the face isn't shown) and we could assume that the couple meet again in the modern time, this would've been VERY cliche but it at least made me feel better about the ending.
Also there a fan made continuation called old souls as a webtoon, I read a few chapters and I didn't really like it, but someone may.I would've preferred it if they ended it at the guy becoming king and left it at that. I would've wondered at what happened to her family back in modern times but we weren't shown much of them to begin with so I would've been fine. Even if I would've had many questions I would've still preferred it.I'm just venting now but I hate it so much how everyone became twisted... of course I wanted Soo and So to end up together, but at the same time Soo had such a great relationship with Wook and don't like how Wook had to betray her in order for Soo to end up with So... and Eun! I was so sad! At least with Wook's first wife everyone knew it was coming, but I was hoping that with Soo's intervention Eun and the other girl would've been saved.I have so much more to say, but I really need to do something in order to not feel depressed for the rest of the day (which is made worse by the lockdown and, warming for TMI, my fricking cramps!).",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt5320412,"I rarely write drama reviews and when I do, it means the show has left an imprint in my heart like no other. It is SO good that I actually rewatched the show a number of times now in a few months because I could not get over it, and watched all the behind the scenes and interviews related to it, as well as reading discussions and news about it (sounds like an exaggeration but it's true).
First, it is important to mention that there are two versions of this pre-produced show, one that was sold to other countries before it aired in Korea, and another slightly modified (much better) version that aired on SBS with alterations in its montage due to domestic demand, as people in Korea wanted to see more scenes of their favorite lead actor and more relationship dynamics displayed and explained.
I watched both versions, and I must say it is a shame that it was edited and sold the way it was first made, as the cut scenes for me were crucial for the understanding of how relationships between characters, especially the lead characters, developed. I would love to have the SBS (domestic) version on DVD, but it is unfortunately not available as far as I know. Despite being the only downside of this drama for me, the not very successful first editing and montage of the show does not make the first version as bad as one thinks.
Now I move to my experience with watching the show with comments on the plot, acting, characterization, direction, cinematography, and costumes of the show.
While watching the first episodes the first time, I was still not sure what to expect, as they were a bit lighthearted, contrary to what is expected of a drama tackling a crucial period in the history of a nation. But because the story was a bit original for me, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and continued watching.
Soon I got hooked because of the brilliant cinematography and direction (e.g. Wang So riding a horse during the eclipse, the ceremony to ward off evil spirits, the rain ritual, etc.), the excellent acting skills of the cast (especially Lee Joon Gi and Kang Ha Neul), and the very well placed cliffhangers that always make you eager to see what will happen next. All these also contributed to me suspending disbelief with all the time travel concept and the superstitious beliefs upon which some of the story was based.
While watching, you may at first develop a second-lead syndrome and root for Wook for than Wang So, which later changes however as you start understanding their characters more. This leads me to the development of characters and their relationship dynamics, which was for me better understood after knowing more about the historical background of the show and also with the Korean version of the drama referred to earlier. All in all, most characters in this show were portrayed as round, not flat, either having both good and bad sides in their character, or their ""bad"" actions mostly justified, which makes it difficult for you to judge them for things they had done.
In addition, though heart-wrenching in many ways, the show gives you a cathartic feeling, and you end up appreciating the way it ended, though it may not have been to your liking. Having said that, I strongly believe that this show should have had the chance of a second season, which apparently the production company have made a decision not to make, probably due to the unjustly initial bad domestic reception. This viewpoint is shared by hundreds of thousands of fans of the show, if not millions, who four years past the first season are still demanding a second season fervently.
I think I can still go on and on talking about other aspects of the show, but probably this is enough for now.

If he has messed up the last 2 episodes would have been crap.If you are looking for a different K-Drama with all elements in it - Try this - Definitely worth your time.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt5320412,"This particular serial is a darling for many Kdrama fans who live in false hope that a season 2 will somehow happen. Many have been waiting for years, which in itself can tell a potential viewer how valued and appreciated this is.I am told that Korean viewers did not love it as much as international fans did. It is unclear why.The story is beautifully told, there is a wonderful balance of pathos, complexity, light relief and tragedy to make any true Kdrama fan happy. The story is slightly complex with many strands and an ensemble cast who have all done a stellar job. The tragic undertones and foreshadowing are always part of the storytelling. Yet it is a joy and a pleasure to watch.Despite the Chinese vaersion having more than 35 episodes while this was 20 episodes, I found the pace appropriate and suspect I would have found more episodes tedious. The episodes were sharp and focused and moved forward the tale effectively. We are introduced to the backstory of Wang So the protagonist with dramatic flair, our hero and heroine meet in a suitably dramatic fashion, and our heroine struggles but learns to adjust to the new world she finds herself in. As happens in the best Kdramas, the leads are not the only ones with a great story, the other characters have equally deep and interesting story lines that progress. The change of tone and the journey of key characters from light hearted young people with nothing to worry them to being in the midst of battles of life and death, and political chess games that can and do cause death was riveting. In the end, the natural progression of life in a court takes place and it is a bitter sweet ending.The final denouement does close the loops and show how the events of the story have changed our key characters and the world around them. It also tantalises the viewers with an open ending that shows future possibilities.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

It is set obviously in the past and it is beautifully filmed. From start to finish I don't think I cried so much through a kdrama, but the end left me sobbing in tears.

tt17513352,"Twenty-Five Twenty-One is one of those series that has tropes of other romantic K-Dramas, but is more concerned with characters and story revolving around them, rather than meet-cutes and overbearing romance.Twenty-Five Twenty-One is a show About aspirations, conundrums that young people often face as they try and figure out who they are and what they want their life to be; the pressure to have certain ambitions and a life plan mapped out ahead of you.Kim Tae Ri as Hee-Do was amazing as the main lead, comical yet mature at times, jolly yet serious about her ambition. That makes her a well written character. Although I do think that there should have been more backstory for Baek Yi Jin since he is the male lead and we heard a number of times about his part, but didn't actually encountered even once.The story was well developed, even with the supporting characters and the constant shift between in the chronology was well maintained. Twenty Five Twenty One is a show that combines many elements such as romance, drama with comedy but above all a coming-of-age story. It's a story of youth that sees life in various colours and makes us believe that certain things may not be forever, but it should be enjoyed until it lasts..My Rating : 9.5/10.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"This show was a bloody masterpiece - the characterisations, the aesthetics, the writing, the storytelling techniques... all of it was incredible. It's nostalgic and heartwarming yet portrays the mundane nature of reality and how youth simply drifts away, which I find to be the saddest portrayal of all.

tt17513352,A young girl tired of learning ballet and angry with her mother goes to stay with her grandmother and whilst there she begins to read her mothers diaries from her youth. Her mother was a successful fencer who competed in the olympics and the main core of the series is her mothers rise and her relationships with those around her. It is an interesting story where whilst pursuing her fencing career she is estranged from her mother and is attracted to a man four years her senior who's parents have gone bankrupt and he is struggling both financially and emotionally. Initially they help each other as friends and provide each other strength and support for them both to do well but overtime the feelings become much deeper. Lots of interesting side characters and the secondary story of the daughter realising the struggles and heartbreak her mother went through is well done as most children forget that their parents were once young and irresponsible.

Here she does a marvelous job of growing up before our eyes.The fencing milieu is another reason to watch this drama. It is a world that is entirely new to me and interesting to discover.K drama is so good at giving us real, rounded relationships and that quality is deployed effectively here. The 5 central protagonists each successfully define their own space in this drama through their interactions with the other characters.My reservation is with the ending, which detracted from the joy that preceded it - for me at least.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"There is a lot of debate over the last episode. It's either 0 or 1; meaning to say a reviewer either liked it or didn't. The other episodes have all same ratings; people loved them, if to say so in a short sentence.I also wanted to understand the real intention of creators, when they showcased the last episode; where the primary purpose was to portray break-up in a bold and comprehensive way. Maybe the intention was good, but somewhere I felt few pieces missing or not given justice. I would like to elaborate that here.The two leads: Hee-do and Yi-jin drifted apart, mainly due to their job and workloads. While Yi-jin had to fulfill his commitments after his family's bankruptcy, Hee-do never liked her mother's job, because she never spared anytime for her. Now when Hee-do faced the same challenges through Yi-jin, she thought best to part ways due to known/unknown situations she was already afraid off, rather diving into them again. I would say, yaa, a person in early twenties may think so, but that should not be the case.Let me now jump to Yu-rim family. Her hard working father mostly remains outside driving his van. Her mother runs a restaurant. Inspite of poverty challenges, they live happily. Yu-rim waits for her father, sometimes for months, and even drinks with him behind her mother: that's called love, that had come after sacrifice and patience. The patience here personfies the trust, the family had on each other.When Hee-do broke up with Yi-jin, the primary reason was the time that he couldn't offer her, as he used to. Yi-jin always knew about it, and yet he moved forward, thinking he could manage stuff, she would understand him.Now I have a question here. Would it have been the same if the two had got married? Or after a child? That's where the echo of problems start resonating. It should be the trust that should have kept them together. Out of that trust, they should have worked up to find a solution of their nascent stage problem rather jumping into conclusion of breaking up. As per me, break up is never an option after you have met someone who stands for you, keeps you smiling, beckons you when it's wrong, appreciates your success and above all, with whom you feel safe. If a job was the crux of your breakup, then either your love fell short or it was always a crush.8 stars for all the other episodes except last.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"

tt17513352,"Very enjoyable, strong well developed backstories and characters.There are two characters that absolutely and wholeheartedly carry this show, Kim Tae ri ( female lead) and Choi Hyun Wook ( second male lead), they literally disguised themselves inside of the people they impersonate, you WILL believe she is a teenager ( when she is actually 32 years old) and he is showing all the layers of his character and showing a comic side as well as charisma, loyalty and tenderness. I watched them both for the first time in this drama and I have fell in love.For me the last few episodes were very weak, I found myself loosing interest and doing other things while I was watching not really paying attention.It was like there's a link missing in the story between the start and the end, there's no build up and resolution to the story since they show you how everything ends (relationship wise and the medals she wins etc..) so there's not really a big twist and you just see them experience everything.I believe this could have been much better, what a shame because it felt rushed and no detailed enough.The last two dramas of Nam Joo Hyuk (the main male lead) have been like this ( like startup) strong beginning but a very weak and unfortunate last few episodes.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"I started this series just for Nam Jo-Hyuk but i became an instant fan of Kim Tae-Ri. She made the character of Hee-do come alive with her acting. The story looks promising and all the characters are great.Some scenes will definitely make you tear up a little. Nam Jo-Hyuk is doing a great job at portraying Baek I-Jin's character.Looking forward to what this story will develop into.The series has officially ended and took a piece of my heart away with it.Words cannot express the happiness, sadness, grief, and all the other emotions I have felt while watching this series. I laughed with these characters and I cried with them.A perfect story in every possible way. All the characters are brought to life by these actors. I have loved Nam Jo-Hyuk for a considerable amount of time, but from now on he will be Baek I-Jin for me.The last episode, though sad, was amazing in every respect. Baek I-Jin and Na Hee-Do will be each other's first love forever, and that in itself was beautiful. Hats off to the writer, director, actors, and the whole staff for making a drama as great as this one.I will definitely recommend this drama to everyone.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"This drama started so well, and my wife and I (K-drama afficianados as we are) were pulled in and waited eagerly for what was to come.But eventually we got the feeling that not only could this drama have no happy end, we would not even be bothered if it did not.The reason was that
a) the main characters, especially. Back Yi-Jin developed into someone less likable as he grew older. His failure to manage his career and his love was not exactly impressive.Besides, he was full of himself and the not so great job of journalism, and his near collapse from handling the 9/11-aftermath means that either he was very weak, or the story (was weak).B) Young Hee-do was a girl most would have loved, I supposed,.but the grown-up version? We all wondered what happened from when she retired until she was a mother.Taken together, no happy end was possible, and sadly enough not missed either.So, we had a Swedish social democratic moment of 'yeah, well, that is life'. The reason why Chess was a failure (compared to most works by ALW) is the same; in the end, nobody cared. Let me, as a writer, state the rules; the audience shall either leave crying OR laughing ('han' or 'heong'), but never with a 'yeah well'.We started at 10 and ended with an average of six.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"Update: wonderful episodes 1-15. Then they completely messed up last 30 minutes of episode 16. I was hoping for a surprise ending but no - they decided to disappoint.I am so distraught with the ending.-----------------
Nam Joo Hyuk does very well here so far. There's something about the way he uses his eyes that allows few words to be spoken yet the intensity of his emotions can be felt.Kim Tae-ri does well too, but needs to tone down her theatrical gestures and speaking. She'll need to remember that in a smaller screen, theatrical movements and delivery of lines can be off-putting and jarring.Story is refreshing. Can't wait for the upcoming episodes!",unknown,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"Feels like the writers got tired of writing and chose to kill it before it needed to be leaving it with a rushed and poor ending. The actors did great with the material they had but after 16 episodes, it left me annoyed.The back and forth of current time with her daughter to her past with her mom was a brilliant idea. The details of most of the show was great. The ending matters though. If this series continued to keep going, I would give it a better score but the last two episodes left so much to be desired. No history on meeting her husband, all the years in between? So many things left ambiguous after so much detail in the previous episodes. Wish they kept it going with more episodes to fill in the gaps. The idea was great but the writers failed the viewers with the ending.",negative,"Drama, Romance"

tt17513352,"This drama just too good to potray youth which shines and bright that we wish to had it too. We could feel it so precious as we expect it will ended with high expectations for the main lead couple and also the whole characters to keep their relationship like that as it'll lasts forever. After finished episode 16 I also went through phase denial, anger and felt wasted my time and not even thinking that I could rewatch the entire series again. But, as the times pass by, I tried to look back at what was the writer would like to convey through this ending.Turns out that the relationship between Yi Jin and Hee Do was not like the typical couple you know in other dramas. That kind of love they had was rooting for each other from the beginning, and they were still have it even after they break up and time passed. It will be great if we could have them married to each other. But, we knew that the break up does not make them regret to loving each other. They have genuine love to rooting for each other and this kind of love may lasts forever. I could find this is so meaningful and beautiful.We don't need to know how is present Hee Do, Yi Jin, Yu Rim, Ji Woong, Seung Wan have been doing, to whom Hee Do marry, is she divorced, how is Yi Jin things are in Hee Do's room, are they still hang out together. They are not necessary since this is a story of Heedo who regretting her fought with Yi Jin and break up with hurtful words. It haunted her and she couldn't take any look back to her good memories even with her friends. Same like us who can't recall the episode 1-15 after watched the ending of this series. After she found her diary back, and found out that Yi Jin has read her honest words, and Yi Jin reply with his words too, she could feel ease in her heart. Because that haunted her is she wished she could altered the words she gave to Yi Jin when they break up, and turns out they had heart to heart conversation through that diary. Now she can recall her good memories with all her friends including Yi Jin, embrace them again and treasure it forever.This is a rare drama that comes up with well written storyline, beautiful cinematography (can we call it as an art? The details are just wow!), I can invest in all the characters individually and also bond is shown in this drama. Thank you for all of them behind this drama, for not focusing in the main lead, but gives everyone depth development. All emotions are so real and relatable. This drama just keeps on getting better and better in each episode, even I could find the colors from the sorrows of the ending after days of depression. We really went through what Hee Do feels.Accepting this drama in that way, so I can rewatch again and again this series as Hee Do treasure her youth. The feeling of waiting for this drama to air every weekend also does not lasts forever. But, I will not forget that this drama has comforted and encouraged me the most since first aired.

But we need to talk about the last episode. *Spoilers* They DID not show back yi jin, they did not show about the father of na hee do daughter's and na hee do loses some personality. Na hee was always strong and stand for her believes, but the end does not shows that. It's like she is someone else. And the part way before that, when she ""forgot"" about the amazing summer trip, no way. Na hee do would never forget. But in the end, she remembers. It supposed to be poetic? Because to me sounds more like she is not endearing anymore and no longer strong with her thoughts. It's not about growing up, she changed and I wonder why... Because of the brokeup? Really? They even clarify things and hug each other. I don't buy it. And it was a lack of consideration with back yi jin, we just get a post credit scene a little bit empty and it doesn't show the actor.

Safe to say it was an absolute delight to watch her,she portrayed the character of Heedo so perfectly. The whole drama was a delight, up until ep 13. After that,things just went haywire gradually and it seemed like the writers didn't even know where the drama was going.The drama depicts growing up and the responsibilities that come with it quite perfectly. Youth,friendships, first love,all nostalgic aspects portrayed beautifully. The characters, even though some Remain unlikable till the very end,all had some form of growth.I don't understand how they messed up the last episode so royally...the characters' decisions just don't align with their personalities and how they have been throughout the drama. It feels like a sad ending just for the sake of it. It was also very abrupt and we don't even get to see what the ML is upto in the present.Still,the actors and cinematographers all did a fantastic job worthy of praises.

It made me laugh and cry at the same time. The ending was not what I wanted but I still liked it. Baek Yi-jin and Na Hee-do became the bestest friends, they fell in love, they dated, they grew apart and they broke up. The reason they broke up made sense though she didn't wanted to spend her adulthood like the way she spent her childhood, just waiting. The scenes where all five of them were together drinking, laughing, crying, talking about their families and playing means everything to me. Their youth ended without them even noticing.

tt17513352,"Review By Kamal KTo start with, the vibe of the show is pretty much perfect. I really loved Na eedo's character and how the themes were incorporated into the show, dreams, efforts, happiness, friendships, different types of love, supporting each other from afar...it was all just really beautiful. I still love all the friendships in this, and for the most part the time jumps were done really well with us seeing how the characters grew into adulthood and went about their lives after growing and learning from each other.Kim Tae Ri and Nam Joo Hyuk starred as main leads and potential lovers. Kim Tae Ri added a likeable charm to her onscreen persona, HeeDo. It is a difficult feat at times for an actor playing the role of a younger character to adopt specific mannerisms or characteristics in order to make their performance feel authentic.Overall, Everything up until the last two episodes was great, interesting and had me enraptured. I would recommend this drama.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"What a masterpiece. From the story writing, cinematography, and the character development it was so well put together. The story from start to end is different from the usual kdrama plot so it's refreshing to watch. The drama has triggered my emotions from my high school days. I don't cry that often in these type of shows, but this one brought me to tears! (especially at the shoe tying scene)You need to change your perspective on the ending to see that it's really a happy ending. Yes, they did not end up together, but it was never going to work out. Hee-do wanted someone that could share all their happiness, pain, laughter, ect. Yi-Jin however kept treating her like a younger sister, shielding her from all the sadness that he was experiencing. In fact so much his life was filled with hardship that he learned to only rely on himself. As Hee-Do said, they were only lovers when times were great. The times where her encouragement were easy to reach. People think that it was 9/11 event that broke them up, no it was eventually going to happen anyways on any other events. They weren't meant for each other. Even with time, she's going to be continued to be disappointed in him.But that's what's first love is. You are so filled with emotions that you cannot see anything else except for your love. It's not until you start becoming an adult and start experiencing hardship that you figure out who you really should be with. First love, however, is not all sadness. There are great memories and lifelong friends that are made. You are going to keep looking back at when you were younger and remember all the happy moments. All these moments are part of your youth, part of your growth that made the adult version of you. The ending captured perfectly that sentiment while the adult Hee-Do looked back at the tunnel. It represents a connection from her past and her present.

The time slips didn't work well enough, and the series eventually just bogged down. The ending does not work with the characters or the plot. In a word it was tacked on for no good reason. It's not a bad series, but not great either: frankly, I think the writer blew the ending and ruined the beauty of her own series. Because, just as in ""Something in the Rain,"" characters designed as people who love each other that much do not carelessly break up. In that series the writer at least realized the mistake and tried to fix it in the last episode- including the signature umbrella. This time, the damage done is clumsy and so sad.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"

I personally start watching this because it's light, refreshing, entertaining and gives me/viewers smile every episodes.What really sucks here is not that they don't end up together, what's sucks here the most is the open ending? I mean duh? What's wrong with you people? You can atleast make the viewers moved on.I'll probably not continue watching this and I will not recommend this to anyone.The actors gave an awesome performance and they've given life to the characters that's why viewers loved them.As for the writer, I hope you can find happiness and stop making this kind of ending.We are all aware of reality and people don't watch this genre of kdrama just to be tormented.",negative,"Drama, Romance"

Na Hee Do is definitely a memorable character and reminds me so much of Doek Sun from reply 1988! If you're looking for a K- drama with a similar vibe to Reply 1988, this is it.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"I actually like this ending now (after rewatching some scenes over and over) and I really think it's the single one this series should have.In this type of stories we must firstly look after the main characters dreams and aspirations (Yi Jin wanted to reunite his family again and Hee Do wanted to be Yu Rim's rival and be someone in the fencing community).Yes, their love was beautiful, but existed only to motivate them and help them achieve their goals, that's why the main key between their relationship was always support and motivation (think of how Yi Jin would've ended up without Hee Do, and think how Hee Do would've ended up without Yi Jin)They had 2 different dreams that kept separating them, that's why the relationship couldn't continue anymore. They loved each other but they had to part ways in order to fulfill their dreams.Many people (including me until now) would say that letting go of this isn't in Hee Do's character, but she suffered a lot of time because of how her mom was and now do you really want her to suffer 7 more years just for a happy ending? Do you think it's worth the sacrifice? I don't think so because, as Yi Jin said at some point only gravity doesn't change and as Mago said in Hotel del Luna ""It's hard, but sometimes it's easier to let go than to hold on"".They had a great time together but their love stood in front of their dreams.Also, if they haven't broke up that time, do you think they would be able to wait 7 years for them to be together again? Do you think that's even possible? As I heard somewhere else ""It's hard to miss someone when you don't get to see them"" which is soo true in my opinion.You can see Hee Do in the present time divorced, now regreting the way she broke up with Yi Jin in the past (an important thing is that she regrets the way they broke up not that they broke up, so if she could get over it we all should too :)) ).Everything in this word is temporal, nothing is forever. Even a perfect love story is temporal (even if it seems like forever). Thinking that you'll have something for an eternity just makes you feel happy for a short period of time, thing that can be both: a good and a bad thing at the same time (a good thing short-term and a bad, sad thing long-term). Also recommend you to read ""Being and Time"" by Martin Heidegger, a really good but difficult book :))That's why, this ending is a very good one and all of us should get over it. Yes, it's sad, but life doesn't give us everything that we want also.More than that, this is my answer on a question I found online about whether Hee Do is divorced in 2009 (at the funeral) or not (even if no one asked me about it :)) ) : I'm sure that Hee-Do is married when they're at the funeral. Yes, she says that line but then Ji-Woong says that line hits different when it comes from someone who's married (looks at Hee-Do). Note that the funeral scene is before the interview Hee-Do and Yi-Jin had (about the San Francisco medal) and that's why he didn't want to hear anything about Hee-Do from Seungwan because he knew that Hee-Do's competition will be in 2 weeks and he'll cover the story. Now, fast forward to the scene before the interview, he eliminates the 5th question because is related to her personal life (probably it was a question about her wedding, or her child, read more to see why). Now again fast forward to the interview scene, they talk about the competition, and so on (more lines to see on ep 14 if I'm not wrong with this) and he ends it all with congratulations for her getting married.We know from the beginning that her daughter is a middle school kid, and later on that she is actually 15. And the present time scenes take place in 2021.In ep 5 we can see Hee-Do with a wedding ring, when Min-Chae is like 10 yrs or something like that (idk, but we know that her daughter was a ballerina for 5 yrs). So my guess is that she divorced in that period of 5 years, 2016-2021. More than that, if we do some simple math we can find that Min-Chae was born in 2007 which means that Hee-Do got married in this period 2002-2007.But now, after I did all of this research it seems a little weird, because in this period of time 2002-2009 she practiced a lot for other competitions (San Francisco and so on, Yi-Jin named some of them on their interview), got married, had a child, recovered after having a child, and won gold medals after gold medals. Either she was very determined and she's a super woman, either the writers pushed the things a little too much :)))",positive,"Drama, Romance"

After re-watching, I still stand with my initial comments.SPOILER!I wasn't sure how the writer would end this but I was satisfied.

tt17513352,"This series isn't as good a sports series as weightlifting Fairy or Fight for My Way. There are some good points but the story isn't uplifting because the ending is depressing.The plus points of this show are: Kim Tae Ri acts like a teen convincingly. She is in her thirties. She gives an endearing performance without getting annoying. Nam Joo hyuk's character is quite sympathetic with his financial difficulties vividly and painfully portrayed. Later on it is interesting at times to see the pov of a journalist and his struggles and how his stories hurt people.There are some faults: The show could have been cut by a few hours. The fencing itself is boring, despite efforts to make this interesting it is a boring sport over in a flash. The main fault is the breakup. Although you know from the beginning they don't end up together it still feels like a downer the way things end. What was the point of all that happened before? It seemed arbitrary and sudden.

tt17513352,"I found this while crossing a desert in Kdrama World. I've watched over 50 KD so far and It's getting hard to find something worth-watching, especially with the new shows being so disappoing (imho).I was about to drop everything Korean, including learning the language! Then I saw The Arthdal Chronicles was coming back, so I decided to go for a last try.And THIS drama was one of the best ever. What I liked most, is how it filled my heart with joy. Kim Tae-ri was one reason for sure. I didn't like her in Mr Sunshine. But here, she is tuly a rainbow, bringing light and colors to my deepest, darkest inner places. She was so... young!NJH was also great. His acting skills have undeniably improved. To the point, someone wrote, that he could convey intense and suble feelings with just his eyes and a few words. I felt for his character, I did.Their love. Was beautiful. To the very end.Well, the ending... After so many dramas , I still can't get use to that kind of endind. I know, boy do I know, that this is exactly how this should end for the story to keep its meaning and credibility.... But my heart is a mess right now. Also, for people who stopped watching at the credits, there is a tiny additional scene that you need to see. I suspect those cunning, cold-hearted directors do that kind of thing to have us discuss endingly about what happened next. I didn't check, but I'm sure people are already speculating about what the main characters did while being both single and living in Korea and being so easily reachable...Writers, producers, directors. Just know that this is cruel. Viewers have feelings too. Quit toying with us.Also, 9/11 must have been tough on some people...Ah, why would I remove a star? The KISS. KISSES!!!! Stop messing them up! Just leave them alone. IF you're going for an impulsive kiss, then do just that. Enough with the slow motion, if anything, it only removes the chills! Please have a peek at Coffee Prince and see a real kiss. Gosh!Having said that, I am grateful for all the joy, laughs, tears without excessive pain, and for allowing us to go back in time with everything being so real and accurate, down to the last detail.And thank you for bringing me back to KDland.

Being from the US I have not even been able to watch anything on TV about that subject as it is much to painful, and it is not something I was expecting. I feel it was without warning for those that may have real feelings about that day. We all remember where we were on that day, and what we were doing and some of us don't want to remember it. I watched it only for Nam Joo-hyuk in the beginning when I searched for his name, and as it turned out I watched the last 2 episodes only for him too because I invested so much time in the series already and he is my favorite actor.

Well it started out that way and then about Ep 13 took this spiraling and depressing trek that made me wonder why I wasted at least 12 previous hours of my life on it. The ending episodes were a muddled mess that appears the writers and producers ran out of time and crammed some unnecessary 9-11 drama that tears the story of this awesome young troubled couple apart. My wife and I watch many Korean dramas and comedies and this was by far the most bizarre ending with some twist that homeruns nothing lasts forever and you can't be happy.

The main girl's story is another plus, with layers and layers of family drama, character development, and a nostalgic vibe.As for the romance, it was okay, but it wasn't the highlight of the drama. Rather, it took the passenger's seat, as it ought to consider that there wasn't much to work with.Unfortunately, the ending episodes of the drama were messy and the time skipping got tiring.

tt17513352,"In short: I would recommend this show, or at least until episode 11/12. After that, I skipped a lot of scenes and still got the jist.I generally don't prefer this genre of k-drama, but a friend recommended it because of Kim Tae-ri so I decided to give it a shot. Kim Tae-ri is definitely the highlight of this show. Her acting is phenomenal as Hee-do and she gave us such a well developed character arc.The romance is backseat until the end of the show and by that time you are sick of it. Back Yi-jin consistently chooses his job over Hee-do and it seems that she is putting more into the relationship than he is, so I don't blame her for how she ended things. The way it ended was disappointing though. I felt that Back Yi-jin didn't have any sort of character development. He is really mopey throughout the whole show and can't reciprocate what Hee-do wants to give in a relationship and there is not a lot of development there throughout the whole show. She changes, but he doesn't really except getting involved in work.The real highlight of this coming of age/romance story is the relationship between Ko Yu-rim and Na Hee-do. My favorite part of the show was watching as they turned from enemies to mature best friends. The two really intense fencing matches were really well filmed - they had me on the edge of my seat. Because of Hee-do and Yu-rim, I would rate the first through 10 or 11 episode a 9/10 stars. The last episodes where it is more focused on Hee-do and Yi-jin are not as interesting.With all of the flash backs and flash forwards, and dramatic music with well-worded quotes in this show, I can see what they were trying to do and how Yi-jin and Hee-do not ending up together fits the narrative and message of the show, but I think they sold Yi-jin's character short.Hee-do and Yu-rim are the stars here - the show is about them.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"I'm very biased. This, just like most shows, isn't a 10/10. It's got it's flaws, the plot is simple and easy to guess, some character can be a little one dimensional, some of the acting is meh.

I'm not from South Korea, I wasn't alive in the 90s and yet it manages to capture the feeling perfectly from what my mum mentioned about her experience in the 90s.

I'm currently in bed with a light fever, I feel horrible yet watching this made me realise just how much it helps so I decided to write a review. I'm no critic, as you can tell, I'm not objective.It definitely isn't for everyone, it's not super dramatic, it's not super romantic either despite it being tagged with only ""Romance"" it's a feel-good growing up show about a young woman finding her place in the world, she knows what she wants and she isn't afraid to fight (no pun intended) for her dreams and to archive her goals.

Besides that, it showed us the happiness and relief that comes with having someone, anyone, that you can share your worries with and support you in your tough times.It starts off with showing how the times can always change. One may be rich one day and have no worries when it comes to life, and another day, they may just be left with nothing but worries and sorrows ahead of them.Such was the case for our male lead, Baek Yi Jin. He who one day was just a normal college student got hit by the times and had his entire world change in just a matter of days. This lead him to being extremely depressed and stressed as to how he can make everything be the same as it once was.Here enters our female lead, Na Hee Do, a joyful Highschooler with a refreshing, bubbly personality who aspires to becomes a World-Class fencer. But not without worries of her own, now that her Highschool fencing team was about to close down, she was at a loss as to what to do. Add this to her un-supportive mother who wanted her to quit and her current plateau in terms of skills, life wasn't treating her so well either.And now that it was time for both of them to figure out how to move forward, they happened to come across each other.From here on out, the story unfolds as we know it...This was a short introduction I chose to write before writing my actual thoughts on this show.I won't hesitate to call this show a masterpiece. That's right, a masterpiece, and there are many reasons which prompted me to call it as such.Such being, the way the characters' personalities were portrayed and how they all the actors fit into the roles of the characters they played, the chemistry between the two leads, the writing of the show and how the story plays out, the effect each character had on one another, and so on... There was not a moment where I thought, ""why was this included, there was no need for this"" or ""this doesn't make sense, why was this there"", everything fit perfectly, whether it was the romance, drama, or the slice-of-life aspect of it.To conclude, I loved this show and would definitely recommend this show to anyone wanting to watch something new, refreshing, and wholesome.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"Twenty Five Twenty One is my joint all-time favourite drama with Mr Sunshine. Both have great stories, memorable characters and made me laugh and cry, even after repeated viewings. For older people, it'll bring back memories of life in the 90s and for younger people it'll show how life used to be for their parents.Both dramas feature Kim Tae Ri, who is an amazing award-winning actress and transforms herself with each work. She brings to life Na Hee Do, a stroppy teenager with a heart of gold and aspirations of being a rival to her fencing idol.Twenty Five Twenty One is a coming of age show about following your dreams and friendship. It's not a rom-com and if you don't think of it as such, then you won't be disappointed with the ending.I'm puzzled that so many people have marked the show down for the ending. Yes, it's heart-breaking but if you don't wilfully miss all the signs along the way, then you'll understand the decisions made. I suppose so many people were hugely invested in the characters and that's why they couldn't accept what happened.For me, the only misstep was casting a different actress as the older Na Hee Do, because her vibe was way too different. Kim Tae Ri does look very young, but making her look 42 years old surely wouldn't have been that hard. Despite this, I still give Twenty Five Twenty One full marks and whole-heartedly recommend this show.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"Some may mistake this drama as a romantic comedy. Which it's not. The main point is not even about a romance. It's about a particular period of time of a woman's life, that she cherishes, which helped her to grow up to be the woman she is now.So, in this story, we will see her struggles of growing up in trying times i.e. IMF crisis, how it affected others, her family issues, her first love, her first real love, heartbreaks, her finding friends who make her feel less lonely and help her through all her struggles, and finally her main goal in life, fencing.All the other characters, including the main male lead are centered around our main girl, Na Heedo, a fencing prodigy who is going through a rough patch. She goes on to become a three times Olympic gold medalist later in her life and becomes a successful adoring mother to a girl named Minchae. The latter stumbles across her mom's diaries and take us through the journey of Na Heedo when she was first 19 till she is 22 where she experience great friendship and intense love.The story is heart warming, comical, romantic, yet heart wrenchingly painful at the same time.Our main actors Kim Taeri and Nam Joohyuk do a fantastic job in bringing out the emotions these characters go through. Taeri, who in real life is 31 years of age, acts convincingly (but a bit too shouty) as a teenager who goes onto become a young adult.I quite enjoyed the relationship between Na Heedo and Ko Yurim (Heedo's rival at first and then her best friend), and their dynamics. Bona, who is new to acting does a tremendous job as Yurim, a sweet girl who at first shows a cold personality to Heedo due to her insecurities.My best finding in the drama was Choi Hyunwook as Moon Jiwoong and Lee Jumyoung as Ji Seungwan. Though in opposite gender, they played out the most perfect platonic friendship a couple of kids could have while adding the much needed comedic scenes into the drama. Both actors were newcomers but showed a great acting range.The drama also had wonderful cinematography and excellent osts. The main song ""Twenty five Twenty one"" is hauntingly beautiful (also will give a hint about the ending of the drama).The writer has done a marvelous job especially when it comes to the female characters, however lacks depth with male characters. For an instance, not much growth was displayed by Baek Yijin by the end and the back story of Moon Jiwoong was not explored.Overall the drama was great till episode 10. The ending was not well executed and felt rushed. People may end up expecting more explanation. However, the reason behind the ending is expected and understandable.Despite the somewhat bad ending, the drama is still a must watch by everyone as it will remind you of your best times in life, encourage you to cherish each moment, and make you realize how feeling time can be!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"Once upon a time the US did the best romcoms in the world. And, BTW, the secret of a good romcom is that it pretends to be something else. Take for example. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE. Everyone knows, film student or not, that film is the iconic X-Mas movie about alternate realities, about choosing a path. True. But it is also one of the best romcoms in history. The scene where Donna Reed teases a marriage proposal out of Stewart is one of a kind. It has no equal. It is the equivalent of 100 second-rate romance movies rolled into one. Now Korea makes the best romcoms in the world. And this is one of them. The movie pretends to be about hopes and dreams and challenges and that is all true. But the nuance and subtlety are off the charts. The writing is astounding. The acting is astounding. The grasp of human nature is astounding. There is an iconic scene where Na HeeDo rejects her gold medal and goes off to sulk. The TV reporter who chases her and has feelings for her will not let her wander off. But she insists. YOU OWE ME A WISH he says, and that stops her in her tracks. Amazing. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

But unfortunately, your expectations will be shattered and you won't be able to predict that ending!Before watching it, those who had already seen it advised me to be cautious of how the events would unfold, but I wasn't convinced of that.Alright, I'll try to be as fair as possible: the story was beautiful, the plot development was consistent, and the acting was perfect. However, I wasn't convinced by the reason for the breakup! I felt that the motivation for the two main characters to distance themselves from each other, under the pretext of conflicting schedules and work commitments, was weaker than their overflowing feelings of love for each other. For example, not limited to when they returned to say goodbye in a better way, and also at the time of the interview after Hee Do won the medal in San Francisco, you feel that their eyes were speaking. It was enough actions and feelings to backtrack on the breakup and overcome that problem. I felt that the director hid the real reason from us or didn't want to give us a bright ending.In general, the work is produced by Netflix, and consequently, the stamp of American culture was very clear in the end: work ""the job"" comes first, then family, life partner, and friends come last. This is one of the main reasons that pushed me to stop watching American dramas. There are also many disturbing suggestions known to the platform's works that cannot be detailed here.So, my opinion is that the series is considered good, I wished for a better ending and it was possible, but unfortunately it will not be on my list of recommendations for others.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"I loved watching this drama... It was more pleasant than I expected it to be... It made me cry and laugh, angry and disappointed. It really had greatness to it and I can see the hype around it so well
First thing is characters of the drama. The 5 main one are amazing... Na Hee-Do, when young is competitive, naive, hardworking, optimistic and understanding. I loved her. That is one good teen representation. Baek Ijin was a struggling young adult who found it very difficult to look past his loss. Ko Yu-Rim had great parents but not wealthy. She recieved love but not financial support.I didn't like her at first but then she grew on me.... I loved her. I loved how friendships were build too. Ji Seung-Wan was a cool class president. Moon Ji-Ung and her friendship was so fond. I just loved every relationship shown.The only downside of this drama was how once they began speaking, they didn't stop. And how they spilled all their thoughts at once. But that made me attached to the characters fast. And her mother. She was extremely disappointing. She had harsh work to do but so had Baek Ji-Jin. He still didn't have a hateful relationship with them. When she was home, she only mistreated Na Hee-Do, always saw her flaws and was irritating.I was not happy with the ending but I liked how Na Hee-Do had moved on and became a good mother.The scene of Na Hee-Do and Ko Yu-Rim's match where Ko Yu-Rim was from Russia was so sad and heartbreaking. When both of them removed their helmets and cried and hugged. They were so good. I just loved their friendship so much from then.Moon Ji-Ung's confession was sweet. He was sweet. I loved all of them. The ending was bittersweet. But it was so heartbreaking. Them drifting apart was just devastating. They genuinely loved each other and wanted to be there for each other. But couldn't because time was not in their favour. I LOVED this drama. It was cringy but I would not change it for it being very sensefull.As they grow, they lose their innocence and become mature. Between pager and landlines, their love and friendship was so beautifully trapped. I loved how they understood each other more and put themselves first. I loved how they spent so much time together.It made me realise how beautiful the days of your youth are. I envy their friendship so much. It made me realise how important innocence of a child is.

tt17513352,"Twenty-Five Twenty-One holds a special place in my heart, a series I can endlessly rewatch. Words can hardly capture my admiration for it.Beyond the wild fun, friendship, and love, what truly gripped me was its brutally realistic conclusion. It felt entirely justified.In such narratives, we must ponder the aspirations of our protagonists. Yes, Na Hee Do and Beak Yi Jin shared a beautiful love, yet it was just their catalyst for individual growth - a cornerstone of any relationship.They had two different dreams that kept separating them, which was why their relationship couldn't last. They madly loved each other, but they had to part ways to progress in their lives.Many would argue that letting go of something is not in Hee Do's character, but she has already suffered for a long time because of how her mother was. I couldn't bear to see her suffer for another 5-7 years only for a happy ending. As Yi Jin wisely noted, everything changes but gravity. Sometimes, letting go is less painful than holding on. They had a wonderful time together, but their love was bound to cause problems in their future lives.Everything in this world is transitory; forever is a delusion. Even the most perfect love story is only temporary. Believing in forever offers brief happiness, which is also a double-edged sword.Hence, I applaud the ending. It's melancholic, but sadly, life doesn't always give us what we want.My only gripe lies in the uneven portrayal of Hee Do's and Yi Jin's current lives. We saw enough of her, but not him. Seeing him typing Hee Do's name as his first love wasn't enough. What's his story now? Is he still single, or has life reshaped him as it did Hee Do? My curiosity remained unsated; I yearned for more!Despite this, setting aside that minor qualm, this series is a Masterpiece!!!

I watched The Handmaid in an instant after that, and that is an amazing performance, fully deserving BAFTA for the best foreign language movie. The story is really nice (one of the good features of k-dramas), but she is like an explosion of energy and genuineness on the screen. It would be tough not to be elated by the character she plays.

Her rival-friend relationship with Huido is so touching, and her puppy love with Jiung is super cute. Bona played so well in this role.The story could have been much better if they focused more on the two fenching athletes and their high school life, and get rid of the entire storyline of Baek. If could have been a female version of Rush, or the Queen's Gambit with a female life long competitor. The fenching scenes are amazing, while the story of Baek is completely deattached to the main line and very boring. I couldn't care less about how he moved some seafood and reported some news OMG. If his part is as short as Jiung's, this drama will be 9/10.As a Asian, I think the drama and film makers here really need to learn how to write a story just focusing on women, without spending at least a half of the time talking about her love life. Like this story, obviously fenching is the most important thing in both girls life, and their relationship is what interested the audience.

Reminiscent of the preciousness of some items in the past that will not be replaced by technology. One of them, of course, is a diary. I like the selection of sports that are rarely shown on the small screen, namely fencing can make people interested after watching this. But I also wonder if this sport is that famous in South Korea because this series seems to show that South Koreans are very enthusiastic about this sport. One of them was the reaction of people when Yu Rim changed nationalities. I will also highlight Nam Joo-hyuk who previously played in Start-Up which I didn't like about the series. This time he was given a better but not very good role. Especially when his role has reached a good career stage as a news reporter. He seemed to be made unprofessional especially when in the sports division. The greatest appreciation is given to Kim Tae-ri, who at the age of 30 was able to play a super-super-successful schoolboy who covered his 30s. This is why I somewhat compare it to Reply 1988. One of the reasons is that Tae-ri reminds me of Lee Hye-ri's success in playing Deok-sun.",positive,"Drama, Romance"

But I was invested in the love story so I gave it a chance.I really liked the two leading girls. The actor for Na Hee-do was terrific.

But he is a good actor still.Spoiler: I agree with what someone else wrote that I wish Ko Yu-rim had won against Na Hee-do at some point, she didn't have to be a eternal looser and second place:er.My low rating is definitely also based on the not so clear ending.",negative,"Drama, Romance"

They are pretty endearable in general. Some of them grow a lot during the 16ep, others don't but we discover more of them and we could have a better comprehention of their personalities so it is more interesting.I really cried a lot looking at this. I have felt butterflies in my stomach during romance scenes, joy during friendship scenes (these were just amazing) and pain during harsh moments. It was UGH so touching.Sore points are touch on but always in this context of love, kindness, joy... so yes it works. It brings a bit of maturity and realism, without poverty, alcohol problems etc it would be a bit to much ""kiss kiss love and that's all"". It functions well, did not come out from nowhere.! SPOILER !My only reproach is the end. It didn't stick out to me, the main characters have changed and lost the better part of their personalities. Furthermore it's not well developed (to my mind a bit sloppy), predictable since few ep before and we continue for hours just for sadness again and again and again. It is more realist not to end up with our first love but here... no. They have to be together for sure. If not it has to be for a better reason.

I knew that Na Hee Do and Baek Yi Jin needed to break up at that point in the timeline because they would have been miserable had they stayed together long distance because they both deserve to be happy. BUT. I really really thought they would reunite in present day since it seems she's not happily married to whoever Kim Min Chae's father is (plus he doesn't seem to be home much anyway). Seems such a waste to have sacrificed their love due to quality time when it seems she's unhappily married (or divorced we literally have no idea) and Kim Min Chae's father isn't home with them anyway. What a consolation prize to the love she shared with Baek Yi Jin. It would have been better had they showed her happily married and spending lots of time as a family with her husband and daughter.Also not showing us what happened to Baek Yi Jin in present day just felt so unfulfilling, we also knew little about Na Hee Do's present and it felt so unsatisfying. We as an audience grew so attached to them to be let down like that and have no idea what happened to their lives after they broke up. There were happy endings for everyone but the two leads.So disappointed with the ending and with a show I thought would be my first 10/10 K-Drama.

I was sad, but I wasn't upset. I wasn't happy either but it didn't leave me feeling unsatisfied, especially after the post-credit scene in the final. A heartbreakingly delightful yet simple way to end the story and also summarise it. I appreciated the way the story focused on them, Na Hee-Do and Baek Yi-Jin, and didn't show us the people they end up with in the future. I think not seeing Hee-Do's future husband is one of the reason the ending wasn't upsetting, and a great writing decision, in my opinion. I did feel Baek Yi-Jin lacked a stronger reason to leave, though.

tt17513352,"25 21 writes about a real story. The struggle, concerns and decisions the characters encountered are (mostly) realistic. Almost too realistic, that it throws away all the ""turning tragedy into comedy"", ""pursuing your dream"" part set in the beginning of the show.Main characters Na Hee-do and Back Yi-jing had been through a lot, especially in the beginning when Hee-do cheers up Yi-jing during his lowest times. In the ending, Hee-do decides to end the relationship with Yi-jing because another not-coming-home person is not what she wants in her life. Understandable, as I believe many people have ended one relationship because of conflicts of career paths and personal interests like this. However, personally I think it fits the story better if the drama depicts them holding on to their love and overcome the issues. Cheesy and cliché for sure, but their love is positive and encouraging from the start, it should keep that way as well. The decision Hee-do made is frankly selfish. Even at the end she did not consider Yi-jing's feelings. Promises will fall short due to distance, physically and mentally, but love is not only about how you feel when you are in good terms, but also how you walk through struggles together. Hee-do leaves no chance for Yi-jing to do better about sharing his feelings. The love between them suddenly feels weak and superficial just in the span of two episodes. In the end, it almost feels like Hee-do still does not love Yi-jing as much as he does for Hee-do. Ending like this, gives little hope to non-dying love. Love that can overcome all the difficulties is not impossible, and for the sake of a drama, it can continue to give us a positive message even when most of times, reality can be cruel.In addition to that, it also doesn't go well with the fact that ALL the other main characters either ended up happily with their first love (Yu-rim and Ji-Woong), or are about to start a beautiful relationship (Seung-wan and Back Yi-hyun) that the show hinted at the start, but the main couples have to end, just to break our heart and send out a ""first love is in the past, youth is a just period of time in our lives"" message.",positive,"Drama, Romance"

Hee Do was such an ambitioned, life-loving, funny, strong and cheering person.Yi-jin in the other hand was a bit tired of his life-circumstances and had the lack of hope in life until he met Hee Do. They had feelings for eachother but their emotions also came up really slow, natural and they didnt even rush on with their feelings.Both of their actings were incredible, Na Hee Do being 31 in real life and acting like 18 was shocking for me. For Nam Joo Hyuk I think it is a real improvement in his acting when I compare it with the series Kim Bok Joo.This drama was from the beginning until the end so heartwarming and motivating. I adored how the elder Na Hee Dos history, be it in fencing, friendship or love was played up. I think that showed that every memory in life shapes your future self even it is long-lasting or not. Thats also what I liked in the series that they have not just shown everything easy to get. I understood that youth is an important part of life to keep in memory like Na Hee Do did that time with her diary.Their friendship between Ko Yu-rim, Ji Seung-wan and Moon Ji-woong was so beautiful and it was also entertaining to watch the difficulties of each person and how they tried to overcome and be their best versions of themselves.For the ending I am in the opinion that people of course can grow apart and break up. In life there are many situations like that, so thats why many of the watchers thought that it was realistic. Yes, it is possible but it is also possible that their break up would not be that fast and irresponsible of both sides. Hee Do could not reach Yi-jin anymore and I understand that she doesnt want to be left alone like her mother did. But instead of breaking up there should be more effort of both sides and more understanding.After seeing their pure and passionate love I cant accept the ending.For the most people someone who really loves doesnt have other priorities and thats why many people think that it wasnt real love.Their story was the definition of love for me except the ending. That is why I was really sad at the ending of the series. They have wasted such a great love for a ""realistic ending"" what in my opinion could have ended differently. Even if it ended like that, I would be sure that they needed their time to understand that they are meant for eachother and that they made flaws. Relationships are filled with flaws so thats the realistic part: that they just tried to solve the problems together and accept the difficult phases in each lifes instead of cutting out everything so fast.They were young and after a period of time they would understand that they were meant for eachother. Its a pity that their incredible love was just shown as some crush or basic love story. That wasnt my perception of their love ever after seeing their scenes together. Thats why its an unfair ending for them and for me :')Although the ending has ripped of my heart I was happy that they seperated in a good way. But for the ending I would have wished that Yi-jin and Hee Do would say those words in person to each other and not Hee Do finding out his thoughts of Yi-jin about their relationship after 22 years.Last but not least the script was soooo well written because every scene every sentence was meaningful. I loved how they were just happy because they spend time together. It's not just by that it was amazing seeing them growing up together, knowing eachother well and root for eachother no matter in which situation they were in. Their destiny and how they came up together was sooo natural and beautiful to watch.I am happy that I have watched this drama and I have experienced such emotions that this drama has let me feel.For me it was real love.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"I loved this masterpiece. How can everybody have so much chemistry between each other! They literally give us the best. Every small detailing is so beautiful. Not only Heedo-Yijin and Yurim-Jiwoong but also Seungwan-Jiwoong, Heedo-Yurim, Yijin-Jiwoong, Heedo-Jiwoong, Seungwan-Yijin, Yurim-Yijin, Heedo-Seungwan, Seungwan-Yurim have much more chemistry. Seungwan school left scene left me broken. On the other hand comedy scenes are at it's best. I loved the school trip scenes so much. I literally love the show. Twenty five twenty one shows us the journey, not the destination. First few days I can not also bear the fact that they broke up. But further day by day I realized it that it's beautiful in it's own way. And I don't want season 2 unless they changed the fact. Some things are better left unspoken. I can watch this masterpiece more than once. It never feels bored. Taeri and Joo-hyuk are just awesome. Actually everyone did their best. I applause the whole team.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt17513352,"I binged watched this show, for the first time a month ago, as soon as I finished it, I didn't know what to do with my life.It was so amazingly well done, that I felt like a part of it. I went through so many emotions each episodes, It pulled to my heart strings, I cried, I laughed, I ugly cried and ugly laughed, had teary eyes from sadness & happiness. No series has ever done that to me before.Yin Jin & Hee-do's chemistry was amazing, the friendship between the group, realistic and great.I'm confused as to why some people were expecting a happy ending, it was foreshadowed a lot throughout the serie and even before we were introduced to the story) that they won't end up together.

tt17513352,"I enjoyed the first 12 episodes, you can see all the emotions are perfectly portrayed. Outstanding performance by Tae-ri and Joo-hyuk.Direction is so good, they have shown how the life of youth go on up and down, how they struggle and stand up again.But, also little disappointed with the last two to three episodes, where the scenes were little rush. It didn't give any clarity to the subject and also left so many doubts about what happened next in their lives.Overall It's really really good story, Cast is awesome.. and they kinda bind us through out the entire season.",positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt29839098,"A romance between the Senior Golden Girl, long-time academy instructor, Seo Hye-jin, and her former student Lee Joon-ho, who returns after 10 years to teach at the same academy where he was previously the #1 student.This romance is fundamentally of the older woman and young man genre. (But as there are ONLY 6 years between the ML & FL don't see it as anything to even be concerned about!)The story is in the setting of after school cramming Academies. The rivalry amongst the teaching staff within, the incessant competition for students, and the disturbing unsettling power of the parents.This is utterly baffling to those viewers from countries where the concept of cramming Academies and the competitive nature amongst them is non-existent, so the setting of this story is completely bewildering and it may as well be set on Mars in another future timezone!Long lengthy explanations are plentiful and meaningless for a viewer from the UK. But did grasp (1) that the object of Academys is to teach the student to pass the Exams, not necessarily to understand what you are learning in education! And do not for one nanosecond deviate from this method and whatsoever! And (2) that it is first and foremost a BUSINESS!Sadly these well-known fine actors (Jung Ryeo-won and Wi Ha-Joon) are totally and incredibly wasted, as the Director asks for clichéd performances. However the performance of Seo Jeong-yeon as the powerful Director of the rival academy was noteworthy. She acted out her nickname of ""white-witch"" with an appropriate amount of venom that one felt she didn't need the Director's suggestions!Only one scene raises a smile - when the ML falls out the bed as he attempts to seduce the FL (fully clothed, of course, pleeeeze stop this at least a button-down shirt that can be unbuttoned I mean who gets into bed for obvious s*x with so many clothes on in 2024). The couple never seem to have fun together, quite unlike the other popular older woman/younger man genre ""Something in the Rain"", equally full of family angst and trauma, but where you could see that couple fall in love while having FUN, joyfully discovering each other together in the kitchen, the bedroom, or just walking!At times it seemed as if this series was bordering on becoming a documentary about Korean Cramming Academies!Just cannot recommend it.Korean audio + English subtitles.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt29839098,"The conversations are so real and the storyline and character development make sense and the acting is so convincing and natural. It is very refreshing to come across an intelligent and fairly realistic drama like this in K-drama land. It is still a drama of course with plenty of conflict and tension and feelings, but it is free of flashy materialism, immature characters and antics, and unrealistic plot events. I really enjoyed watching this one.If I could have made two requests of the director and production team, they would be:(1) I wish they could have varied the music. I get that this is this director's style, to use the same songs over and over again. He did the same thing in SITR, another drama I really enjoyed. But the repetitive music was annoying there as it was here.(2) I wish they had kept the original drama name of ""Graduation"" in the English marketing of this drama. ""Graduation"" is a much more poetic name for this drama than ""Midnight Romance in Hagwon,"" which sounds like a paperback romance or Hallmark movie and this drama is far from those. Maybe the production team thought the drama would get even fewer views with the original name, but I think this drama will get the attention it deserves in time.I hope more people discover this one and enjoy it as much as I did. Dramas like this one are why I keep watching K-dramas, even if worthwhile ones like this one are few and far between.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt29839098,"Firstly, we have a unusual dynamic duo of a famous teacher at a coaching institute pairing up with her former star student who has joined his former alma mater as a teacher himself. The chemistry is electric and both the main characters have delivered a sublime performance and fit together. The female protagonist Seo Hye-jin is initially extremely reluctant to have her student working alongside her but the universe conspires to work together closely. (Major friends to lovers and forced proximity tropes in here)The drama also sheds light on the extremely competitive academic system in Korea. I also have prepared for one of the most competitive exams in India and was extremely lucky to have fantastic teachers at the coaching institute to focused on keeping us engaged and really making us understand the course content in depth. Initially I started off with extremely low scores at the bottom of the batch and slowly reached one of the top batches similar to the male protagonist Lee Joon-ho.This drama will always hold a special place in my heart. I cannot wait for the subsequent episodes to come out.P. S. Coming off watching Queen of Tears & Its ok to not be ok, Most Bollywood / Hollywood stuff has become disinteresting for me. Honestly thought I would never find another drama which measures up but I was dead wrong.",positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt29839098,This show is brilliant in every sense. It gave a good insight on the education system. The script and plot was through provoking and so realistic. Every scene felt natural. The casting was superb. Jung Ryeo-won and Wi Ha Joon's acting brilliantly showed the nuances of their characters. The romance between them was so beautiful to watch as it built up in every episode because their chemistry was in a whole other level. Seo Jung-Yeon who was Gray witch did pretty well and gave me Meryl Streep vibes in Devil wears prada. This is up there with One Spring Night and Something in the rain. I'll surely be this rewatching again.,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt29839098,"What lifts this drama apart from the brilliant acting is the writing. The dialogue spoken by the characters nails the emotions, aspirations and ambitions most cleverly. The politics of the tutoring Academies projects a Game of Thrones vibe in the interactions and interrelationships that are exposed. Kim Jung-young (Seung-hee) and Seo Jeong-yeon (Ms Choi) played their roles to perfection in contributing to the tension and drama of the story. Who would have thought that there could be so much reeling and dealing behind the scenes revealing the competitiveness that exists in the education climate in South Korea? The momentum of the story is driven by the strong characterisations. I particularly liked the revelation of the growth in Mr Pyo's character portrayed by Kim Song-il (loved the way he delivered his lecture in one of the later episodes). His importance to developing the plot seemed at first understated but later enhanced his contribution which was a highlight in displaying the brilliance of the script. The two main leads, Jung Ryeo-won as Hye-Jin and Wi Ha-Joon as Joon-ho are amazing. I couldn't help but feel their emotions due to their exceptional performance and outstanding script. So Joo-yeon as Ms Nam (loved her in Doctor Romantic 2&3) is a pivotal character in the ethical issues such as loyalty and professional integrity that emerged in this series. The scenes where the teachers lectured the students was so interesting and the young actors stood out in their roles. Love the OST especially the track, 'Now and Then' which was a most poignant background at some of the more emotional and romantic moments. 'Catch Me' added to both some toe-tapping lightheartedness but also as a metaphor to the ambitions of the characters. Highly recommended and definitely worth watching. If anything, will watch again the interchange between Jo-hoon and Seung-hee in Episode 15. The dialogue in this scene was so well constructed and progressed like a game of chess in exposing the deceit and manipulation. For me, this exchange was the climax of the series.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt13273826,The series is not bad overall but what makes it really special is Yeaom Hye-ran portrayal of the protective team leader. She's sweet and powerful and oddly believable as a seasoned demon Hunter with a heart of gold. I am glad I didn't miss this show.,positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

Of course it's all English subtitles for me and some of the unexplained cultural scenes are lost on me, but those are few and far between. I have really enjoyed this show that is over an hour per episode! There is a ton of content here to watch and it was all expertly done for the most part.
Excellent writing is what has made this show so good. The directing and acting is decent too, but it's the writing that far outshines them all!
For entertainment value this show is great so be sure to check it out!",neutral,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Loved the concept. Watched 10 episodes. Enjoyable, fun, creative.But my head hurts from all the crying - nah, wailing and bawling - and screaming.Maybe it's cultural, but I haven't seen this much screaming in any of the 20-something Korean shows I've watched. It's farcical.All this crying doesn't create drama. Instead, it's annoying and disturbing. ""Skip ahead"" has become my fav button on this show, which is a shame. Some otherwise fantastic scenes are massively annoying to watch because the characters are bellowing, screeching and howling every. Single. Step. Of. Their. Way. Argh!!!To be honest, the bad guys' storyline is more interesting to watch because they don't cry at a drop of a hat, like the good guys.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Either I have been extremely fortunate, or there is simply a treasure trove of K-dramas that I have had the pleasure of watching that have simply been superb! Series from ""Mr. Sunshine,"" to ""Descendants of the Sun"" to ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" to ""Crash Landing on You,"" to ""Stranger"" and on and on. I have been exposed to the very best that Korean television has had to offer, and I'm still leaving out many others.On the surface, a viewer may look at this as a sort of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" type series where three individuals (which becomes four) run a Noodle restaurant, but on the side, they're catching demons, i.e. evil spirits. These people are called ""Counters"" as they are imbued with special, superhuman abilities from their ""sponsors"" or ""counterparts"" in Yung (a sort of staging area before moving on to ""heaven.""). To look at this series with those eyes is to short-change it dramatically.Like nearly all great K-drama series, this series is driven by great, and even deep characterizations with a rich story that actually has something to say; how to deal with bullies, both within the school system as well as within the corporate world; those who would prey upon the weak and helpless.Someone once said that evil tends to pervade when good people do nothing to stop it. Many consider this to be even worse than becoming ""evil.""The story centers around Mun, a young high school boy who's suffered untold and unspeakable horrors by losing his parents in an accident and also the physical disabilities that are the result. And yet, he never hesitates to jump in and protect his friends and those who are ""weak."" Where most people would hesitate or not act at all, he doesn't even think about it. He simply acts. And while he can be impulsive and wears his emotions on his sleeve, he is essentially fearless when it comes to doing the right thing.""The Uncanny Counter"" is a testament to the ideal belief that even the smallest person can make a difference. Yes, the Counters have special powers, but they are also only four people going up against a system. Much like Superman who always finds himself in over-his-head against Lex Luthor...someone who uses the power of the system against him.One of the things I love about K-dramas, is that they aren't afraid to allow their characters to demonstrate natural emotions. In this way, we are given deluge of deep, realistic, and relatable characters. We are also usually given something to really think about. In this series, we are presented with the idea that a person doesn't need to have special abilities or super powers in order to do the right thing; that, indeed, one person, no matter how small, can make a difference. It also conveys the truth that no one needs to stand alone. Bullies are cowards. All of them. And they are easily dealt with when people rally together to fight them.All of the performances in this series are fantastically done. Characters that will make you laugh, sniffle, and evoke raw emotion. I suppose there is a reason why I'm far more into K-dramas right now than American shows, which no longer seem to provide me with stories and characters that speak to me. Instead, we're given a barrage of CGI, wooden characters that have virtually no depth at all.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Season 1 is good, Mun have a good character development. From being a Limp to a super powered counter. Individual characters storyline is good and their character development is awesome.Season 2 is mediocre it has a lot of scenarios that doesn't make sense, especially when watching Episode 6, Mun have psychic power but he wasn't able to prevent Jo-Seok from killing. Then there was also an episode where Mun was about to defeat Mr. Hwang but then, jang-Mul entered the battlefield and Mun would need to let go of Mr Hwang to save jang-mul (because Mr Hwang can use his physic power to kill jang-mul). If i were jang-mul why would i enter the battlefield between this 2 people who have psychic power. I don't know what the director/writer was thinking this is so silly.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"I initially thought this was going to be another action series loaded with martial arts and fight scenes. This show is so much more than that. Sure it has it's fair share of action but what really got me was the personal connections the main character Mun has with his team, his family and his best friends. This goes deep into the feelings of each and how important they are. In the emotionally charged scenes the acting was so genuine I literally cried. I was caught off guard by this show and I can't say enough how I've enjoyed it. Even when trying to explain some of the dynamics between Mun and say his grandmother for instance, I fell apart due to the fact I had the same experience with my grandmother as she was passing. This looks into relationships of all sorts and the complicated web we weave in trying to be acknowledged, loved, guarded, vulnerable and accepted. The story line is solid with great twists and turns, the right amount of comedy and action as to not be campy and the acting is superb. I highly recommend it!",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,Spoiler alert. When Mun's leg was healed they said they can only do that because he was a counter but she healed the students broken bones anyway. When he tried to summon Sin (supposedly they are 3x stronger than humans and inside their territory which makes it 5x) and then a small kid tackles him? I could be nitpicking but these small details are important. It felt like they were extending it or poor execution of a plot twist.,negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Uncanny Counter 2 was very poorly written. The storyline was OK, but the characters continually did totally ridiculous things. For example, you would never stop in the middle of a fight to tend to a fallen comrade, you finish the fight first so you can safely attend to the injured person. It would be bad enough to make that mistake once, but to never learn from your mistake and do it every time is just plain stupidity. The attempt to inject humor into the storyline was also very poorly done. The new counter was a worthless idiot and should have been taken back to the farm where he could have been happy playing with his cows. I did make it to the end of the season but I feel dumber for having watched the series.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Season 1
10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020/2021 South Korean fantasy, mystery, thriller series with 16, 70 minute, episodes.Set in the fictional city of Jungin in South Korea, a group of Counters are charged with ridding the world of evil spirits. The evil spirits posses human hosts who have either committed murder or are evil to the extent they would be willing to. Being possessed by the evil spirit compels the human host to kill and ""consume"" the spirit of the victim making the evil spirit grow increasingly strong and more difficult to extricate and send on to the spirit realm. The Yung, God like inhabitants in a realm that exists between Earth and afterlife, team with people who are in the half living state of medical coma and allow them to live if they agree to fight the demons. The Counters are not only restored to health but also are given supernatural powers and superhuman strength. Ga Mo-tak (Yoo Jun-sang) is an older male Counter who is much stronger and more forceful than the other counters. As a former detective he is also able to use his investigative skills to hunt down the murdering spirits. Do Ha-na (Kim Se-jeong) has the ability to sense when a human hosting an evil spirit enters the Counter's territory. Choo Mae-ok (Yeom Hye-ran) is able to heal others and as an older woman is motherly and nurturing. To cover their real purpose, the counters run a noodle shop around their busy demon hunting schedule.In the beginning of the series, there was a fourth Counter Jang Cheol-joong (Sung Ji-ru) but a super powerful Level 3 (Level one being weakest) evil spirit kills him and consumes his spirit. His Yung companion spirit, Wi-gen (Moon Sook) has to quickly find another partner spirit and winds up drawn to and pairing with a young, non comatose, teenager, So Mun (Jo Byung-gyu). This unique pairing leads Wi-gen to believe this young person, who is slightly crippled on one side, has something unique to offer. To convince the young man, the team offers to heal his crippling injury and allow him to talk to his parents who were killed in the car accident that injured him when he was only 11. Soon the team finds that they desperately need the help of this young man who proves to be the most powerful and diverse Counter of them all. As the team fights many battles together, their bound grows into that of a close knit family. They find that tragic events in their past also tie them together and compel them to risk everything to send perhaps one of the most powerful and evil spirits they have ever encountered to the afterlife.Spoilers*. I am a huge fan of supernatural and action dramas. I like strong male and female characters a complex yet easy to follow plot and lots of character development. This series had it all. The main character was such a cute and likable young person it was easy to understand why the group would so quickly and deeply take to him. The action scenes left me wondering if the actors were doing their own stunts because they were amazing and very fluid. There was a little romance sprinkled in although that was in no way a central focus. The central character's growing skill was fun to watch. We were immediately drawn in and hooked to the last scene. It ended well (not sad) and plot points were wrapped up. There will be a second season but do not think that means this one did not wrap up. It stood lone well yet has some elements that would nicely carry to the next season. Highly recommend this series.Season 2
10 is my rating. This is a 2023 South Korean Supernatural Action Drama with 12, 61-74 minute episodes.First I provide a Unique Synopsis then ReviewSynopsisThis is everything season one was but with more intensity. While they defeated the evil spirits in season one as was sinisterly predicted by the level three they extracted, evil is back but even stronger. Ga Mo tak (Yoo Jun-sang) returns and is now back on the police force so arresting the host after the evil spirit is removed is easier. Do Ha na's (Kim Se-jeong) ability to to sense the evil spirits is no longer as useful as the evil spirits have learned to see the territory and avoid it. Choo Maeok's (Yeom Hye-ran) ability to heal makes her an emphasized target for the evil spirits who have also absorbed the ability to heal and understand the importance. So Mun's (Jo Byung Gyu) abilities have now far surpassed that of any other counter. There is a new counter Na ro bong (Yoo In Soo) who is clumsy and oafish but has the ability to ""sniff out"" evil spirits. The evil spirits in the second season have the ability to absorb counter's special abilities especially Hwang Pi kwang (Kang Ki young) who has psychokineses on par with Mun and absorbs the abilities of those counters he consumes. Gelli Choi (Kim Hieora) is his right hand evil henchwoman who is a third level with a spike globe that enhances her physical damage by causing britally deep gouges and cuts in her victims. Like Ha na, Gelli can read and erase memories. Their third evil spirit team member is Wong Li Qiang (Kim Hyun Wook) who absorbed the ability to heal but takes psychotic delight in brutalizing his victims.A third-level evil spirit specializing in speed who scratches, stabs, cuts, and kills. She can also read and erase memories. Mun struggles with concepts of good and evil when someone he greatly admires, Ma Joo seok (Jin Seon kyu) turns evil after his wife and unborn child are murdered. With evil spirits more powerful than ever, and the lines between good and evil blurred, can the counters prevail against seemingly insurmountable odds?ReviewCould you skip two and just watch season one? About the only thing you might miss is Mun becomng even more amazing. But they are fighting new evil so it is a little bit stand alone. In my opinion it is better than season one just in terms of how much stronger and more powerful both sides have beocome. But, the silly slapstick elements incorporated in season two were a huge detractor made some determine they could do without it. It ends well and everything is resolved yet there are onvious openings for additional season(s).Spoilers*.I like Yoo In Soo and was happy to know he was going to be in the 2nd season. That is until they introduced Na Ro bong and his character was ridiculous. The whole dung and potty humour was too much. Ok we get it you worked with cows. And his ability to smell evil? That could have been interesting I am thinking of ""The Girl Who Sees Smells"" but they made it so he would put his head out the window like a dog. And he wasn't even that great at it. He would lose track and misdirect. He was useless in the physical fights and, if anything, put the others in danger. He had the mentality of a young child. If they had left that character out the show would have been better.They put way too much slapstick comedy style throughout the series. Reapers are a serious thing in all the other South Korean shows I have watched. The ""counters"" were serious bad asses in the first season. This season they trivialized their role by making it over the top silly. I mean, the main counters were still serious, but they interacted with Na Ro bong, and he was so silly that it made everything silly.Once again Netflix deviated from the elements of South Korean drama that most fans love. Repeat after us Netflix kdramas should be one season with 16 episodes. Supernatural beings are serious characters.One well written plot twist was when Gelli Choi discovered she could see by reading their minds when and how the counters first got their abilities. I thought ""big deal what can she do with that?"" Then she was fighting with Mun and realized the only way to defeat him was to steal his memory of gaining his power. She did that and it took Mun out for a significant portion of time. I did not see that coming.From season one I really wanted to see Mun and Ha na become a couple. If anything in season two they mive farther from that. Ha na even has a side romance. The romantic in me still hopes for a season three and they finally get together.#UncannyCounter2 #YooJungSang #KimJeSeong #SungJiRoo #JoByungGyu.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

I would love to see another season of this!Edit: season 2 was a train wreck. Like others have pointed out, it was very badly written. I highly recommend skipping season 2 altogether.

tt13273826,"Season 1 was good but coming to season 2 the storyline is getting too draggy. So many scenes where there were good opportunities to capture the villians but it always turned into a silly-scene with the good parties being caught up. I feel that it can be better in a way that the good parties are not naive. Too many repeated scenes of such mentioned makes the whole season too bored. It should be portrayed in a more situated thinking with common sense. The interest of watching it has been dropping towards the new season, not very looking forward to the next episode. Probably gonna be the bad guy making the good guy look stupid and then the good guy got reminded of the past, his friends, his family, all the good old times and become goku and wiped them out. Cmon, it can be better.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"I have enjoyed Uncanny Counter so far. The only thing wrong to me is the emotions sometimes seem to put of place. This does not happen all the especially in the latest episode when Mrs. Chu almost died or probably in the 12 episode after the detective is found in her car. Like I said before though, some acting was just too over the top. Though this happens sometimes it is still a good show. I enjoy watching the characters created and then five together always makes me laugh somehow. I hope anyone who reads this just tries the show out.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

Luckily for the world there are a special group of people called counters who with their fighting abilities defeat the spirits releasing the trapped souls and bringing the human to justice. The counters in this city are an eclectic mix all with different special abilities to try to defeat the spirits. When web toons are brought to the screen I believe the stories are often less fluid but this flows really well and is very entertaining with good performances from the entire cast.Season 2: I would give this a solid 8, usual dark forces need to be defeated by the counters and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way. Great acting by the cast and decent special effects but didn't quite have the spark of the first season.",neutral,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

Each episode unravels more and more of the characters with each of them having their own unique life and personality.There are villains, rascals, goodies and baddies then wrap that up with a few evil spirits and a bit of magic - and I'm in. I would not normally watch something like this - and was initially interested in the comic style of the opener. I am glad I gave it a chance. I impatiently wait for the next episode on Netflix each week.Great work by the writer Ji-na Yeo and the director Seon-Dong Yu. And of course the actors who do the script justice.",neutral,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,A good storyline with promise and some great acting. Let down midway just to add a whole lot of unnecessary drama.

tt13273826,"The actors and characters are appealing, and I like that they feature a strong middle-aged woman as one of the leads. She even occasionally gets a few good lines, although basically she's there to play den mother to the rest of them. This series started as an interesting fantasy that turned into (yet another) variation on a police procedural. Too much school bullying and endless fighting scenes. The vision of the afterlife is unimaginative and ludicrous. Everything is white, including the file cabinets and there are some crazy rules: ""We want you to catch the evil spirits who are embedded in bad, bad human beings, but, hey, don't get involved in human affairs."" And what is all this stuff about the ""territory"" boundaries moving around. Nonsensical twaddle. I know the tousled, disheveled look is in, but it's not working for Ga Mo Tak. He needs a better hairdo.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"This series is extremely over the top, Melodramatic and takes forever to get to the point.I am not sure how people can rate this 8. There is not enough substance to warrant 16 episodes. It just keeps on going round in circles and is too mushy.It seems the writer saw all the good korean show's, The ghost buster movies a lot of fantasy content and came up with this. It's highly amateurish and the only way to get through the show is to skip major portions of it.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

tt13273826,"In the vast landscape of Korean dramas, there are gems that stand out for their exceptional storytelling, character development, and sheer emotional impact. Among these treasures, The Uncanny Counter shines as a true masterpiece.This K-drama is a mesmerizing blend of thrilling action, supernatural intrigue, and deep emotional connections that will keep you hooked from the very first episode to the heart-pounding finale.At its core, this drama revolves around a group of individuals known as Counters. These are not your typical superheroes or crime-fighting vigilantes. Instead, they are individuals with unique abilities who work at a noodle restaurant while secretly battling evil spirits known as wraiths. The concept itself is refreshingly original, setting the stage for a gripping narrative that keeps viewers engaged throughout its entire run.One of the most remarkable aspects of it, is its character development. Each Counter has a distinctive background, personal struggles, and a reason for choosing this extraordinary path. As the series progresses, we delve deeper into their lives, getting to know them not just as crime-fighters but as complex individuals with their own dreams and traumas. The character arcs are beautifully crafted, and you can't help but become emotionally invested in their journeys.Yoo Jun-sang's portrayal of the enigmatic leader, Mun, is nothing short of stellar. His stoic exterior hides a past filled with tragedy and a profound sense of responsibility for the team. Watching his character evolve and reveal his vulnerabilities is a poignant and captivating experience.But it's not just Mun who steals the show. The entire cast delivers exceptional performances. Jo Byeong-gyu's portrayal of So Mun, the newest member of the team, is both endearing and relatable. His journey from an ordinary high school student to a Counter is a testament to the show's ability to blend the supernatural with the everyday struggles of youth.One can't discuss this series without mentioning the show's impeccable balance between heart-pounding action and poignant emotion. The action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, showcasing the Counters' unique abilities as they battle wraiths. These scenes are a visual treat, filled with intense fights and breathtaking special effects that rival some of the best in the industry.However, what truly sets this K-drama apart is its ability to seamlessly transition from high-octane action to emotionally charged moments. The series isn't afraid to delve into the characters' past traumas, explore their fears, and examine the consequences of their choices. It's these raw, emotional moments that make The Uncanny Counter more than just a superficial action series.Furthermore, the show's ability to tackle relevant social issues is commendable. It doesn't shy away from addressing topics like bullying, trauma, and the consequences of one's actions. Through its characters, the drama encourages viewers to reflect on their own lives and choices, making it not only entertaining but also thought-provoking.The supernatural elements in the series add an extra layer of intrigue and complexity. The concept of wraiths and the rules governing the Counters' powers are meticulously thought out, creating a rich and immersive world. The mystery surrounding the origin of these wraiths and the true purpose of the Counters adds depth to the overarching plot, keeping viewers eagerly speculating and theorizing.This is a prime example of how a K-drama can be both thrilling and emotionally resonant. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, taking you from the edge of your seat during intense action scenes to the brink of tears in moments of heartache and redemption. It's a testament to the power of storytelling when executed with precision and heart.In conclusion, The Uncanny Counter is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the typical action-packed K-drama. Its well-rounded characters, expertly crafted narrative, stunning visuals, and emotional depth make it a must-watch for any fan of the genre. This series not only entertains but also leaves a lasting impression, reminding us that even in the face of supernatural challenges, it's our humanity that defines us.Must watch.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Season 1 of the uncanny counter was amazing, an unlikely band of noodle shop workers are actually demon hunters who help the needy and solve crimes along the way.Helping souls get to Yung/heaven is a nice sentimental side story.Bullied teens, abandoned children and domestic abuse are also featured.I loved this show and when souls ascended I cried out loud, it was lovely.Then came season 2, pathetic attempts at comedy as the poor cow farmer attempts to become a counter, the cringe factor was higher than the stars could leap, I'm embarrassed for the actors, I'd rather wait longer and have better scripts, I'm on episode 2 and it's just dreadful, it's worse than G. O. T. Season 8, I can't even fast forward through the bad bits. I'm so disappointed.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"It was fine. There are some plot holes though, for example why did the bad guy kill the girl ( I think her name is Kim) in the first place and since he killed so many other people and was able to cover his crimes so easily every single time I don't get why this girl was that much of a big deal. It's not like she's the only one he killed.The action scenes are good but embarrassing at times I honestly kept cringing at the scenes where they jumped idk.The comedy will make you chuckle from time to time so that's good too. And like many other reviewers on here I thought that this show had sooo many crying scenes i dont mind sad scenes every now and then but with this show in almost every episode there had to be a crying scene which was a bit annoying honestly.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"Got addicted to the drama and binged watched it!!
Loved the entire drama, characters played their role well
Storyline was unique and outstanding!!
Ending was also beautiful
I would rate this drama a 100000/10 if I could
Best drama I've watched so far!!!",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,I don't know what the fuss is all about but this drama is just okay. All the main lead did was to cry cry and cry some more. He was too annoying at points that I wished his character was killed off. Yes work/VFX and acting was good but the story was unnecessary long. It could have been finished in only 8 episodes. They just wasted so many episodes for MC to cry.MC's powers ups were such a waste and wasn't even explained why that happened except one line from wi-gen.Honestly I kind of fast forwarded most of the scenes. Too boring for me.P. S. My rating is entirely based on season 1 as I have not watched watched 2nd season yet.,negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,Ok level with me. I'm a 42 year old Australian man and I'm only on episode three but I had to leave a review because it's that good. I'm not a huge fan of foreign films but this has a great story with some good feel good moments. There are some classic cheesy 'Korean film' moments but it doesn't matter. The acting overall is believable and good. I'm loving it so far.,positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"So close. Really, it's so, so close to being really good. Not AMAZING like some of the K-dramas I've seen, but they can't all be genius. There are some great ideas, the character development is fantastic and works well for the plot, which isn't always the case. Great acting for the most part, especially from Kim Se-jeong, Yoo Jun-sang, Lee Hong-nae and even Choi Gang-il. I'll be looking for Hong-nae in other series to see what else he can do. The writing and direction is excellent until the last few episodes, which is REALLY frustrating. I heard they lost the original writer around episode 12 and that makes sense because it just gets lazy from there out. Had they retained the original writer I think this would have been brilliant. The industry should learn from this. It was riveting for ten episodes, even with so much going on, then the FF button came in handy after that.Note to actors: crying and wailing is not the only way to convey emotional turmoil. In fact trauma and conflict was SO well portrayed by Yoo in this that he is going on my favourite actors list. He played his character incredibly well and his range was brilliant even though his character didn't actually need to be to keep the show good. 11/10. Se-jeong was a treat, especially after seeing her in Business Proposal as a completely different character. Very dry, however anything but boring. Really, every supporting character was fantastic. And I really think that Byeong-kyu's issues were a director led flaw rather than his own. If you're directing a show with this many layers, you need to know when to play each emotional card and to which extent. It can't always be either 3 or 10.However, hands down the biggest issue with this was the many, many plot holes. Many. Many many. Viewers are too intelligent to just let a few storyline slips go, and this was a LOT of oopses. You can't simply level up a side without context to keep the story going. Lazy. You DEFINITELY can't just randomly level up one side, then the other, then the first side again etc and hope nobody notices. For example, bringing in some random artifact with no backstory that could have been used to deal with the issue in the first place and saved a lot of headache? Lazy. Bringing in a new, well thought out character that was hinted at early on is a good move. Having a solid group of intelligent, familiar and talented individuals consistently making stupid mistakes just to draw the story out is bad. Bringing back a plot thread that the audience had all but forgotten about though, that's good writing.This is one of those shows that you want to hand back and say ""do one last revision because if you fix these simple mistakes, you'll have something brilliant to show for it""... Is it worth the watch? Yes. But go in with low expectations so that you're pleasantly surprised, rather than the other way around.",neutral,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"If you want a show that makes close to no sense, a show that's supposed to be about character development, yet you barely see any characer development. Annoying teenager with stupid reactions... The worst part about all this. The drama is based on a Webtoon. Then the screenwriters kept changing. I think they had 2 or 3 different ones. Each of them with their own view on the drama. The first like.... 7 episodes, were annoying because of the immature MC, but I was like... ""give him hope, this show is about growing up"". It was sincerely going relatively fine. Stuff was developing alright. Then idk what happened, it became an even worse mess, with an even more crybaby MC that's just a pain. The ending of season 1 makes no sense. You wait 1 entire season for an ending like that? It's a joke! Then with utter disappointment, I started season 2. Again, the first few episodes were fine. Up to like ep 5 I think. Then again, it's like an ape started writing the script. I don't get it... How hard can it possibly be to make a proper story man... This show has so many holes in it's own story! They create their universe with specific rules, then they don't abide by those rules just to make a scene more ""dramatic"". And then there you are, like... ""Bro, just use your god damn powers! You can easily fix this!"". It's a complete disappointment as a show... and they took something with so much potential and created a complete hot garbage.You know how the MC progresses? Attention! By.... doing nothing. Yep, in the most needed parts, the characters become stronger by simply doing nothing.3 stars out of the good few parts in the story, and the potential it could have had. Otherwise.... This is 100% a show you can just skip. It's extremely stupid.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

tt13273826,"I was going to delete my Netflix account and then...
I stumbled upon this. Why is this show uncanny? Well...it strays away from Hollywood (why else would it have so few ratings, & such a high rating?).Why hide this Netflix? I've gotten so bored of you. This show reminds me of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", but in South Korea. Way more in depth than Buffy, no doubt. I guess the demon slaying makes the connection, but I don't know why it reminds me of potentially the best show of the 90s. Could it be the badass fight scenes? The ambiance of a dusty library or delicious noodle shop? Maybe it's just that great.I think I've only written one review on IMDb until now. This show is that amazing, yet I never have time to write reviews. I don't know why it's nostalgic, that is uncanny...maybe it grew on me too fast and I need to rewatch it again?Does anybody read these anyway?",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

The story features a mix of human relationships and action, with a (mostly) great script, amazing soundtrack, and decent, yet low key special effects. Heartwarming characters and lots of a-list cameos round out the main cast, and make for a fresh take on the whole ""teenage superhero"" trope. Even the various baddies are well executed, each having their own unique ""flavor"" which sets them apart.Also, special shout outs to Ahn SukHwan and Ok JaYeon. ASH is frequently cast as a villain/antagonist (which he always plays well), but that only made it extra endearing to see him play a rich, eccentric lovebird/mentor this time around. I was tickled every time he made an appearance! :) And as for OJY, she has insanity down PAT! After seeing her in ""Mine"" on Netflix, I am firmly a fan of her amazing acting chops! This show truly has something to appeal to all ages. If they made a second season I would totally watch it! Highly Recommended!",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

tt13273826,Well. I might me wrong but the show is for kids and it's not definitely my cup of tea. I could somehow get along with season 1 and give it a pass but to be honest season 2 sucks and i really cannot stand it. Interesting story but the storyline is kinda lame. Everything about season 2 doesn't make sense all the good people seem not to be able to do that job and the bad guys and their powers came out of nowhere.

Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect and it's not the best show ever made. It has it's flaws. Certain things here and there that doesnt make that much sense, and the first episode was in my opinion not that good compared to the rest of the show. It felt off and frankly a little gringe and weird, but the other 15 episodes were fantastic.The action/fight scenes and visual effects are great, but the story and characters are what made the show special to me. It's a drama, but it's suprisingly funny as well.

I have begun a few that were just too trite, or thinly plotted to make me go back after one episode. In this one, the main characters are well enough realized and sympathetic enough to make me care about them; the premise is novel enough that I hung in through the second episode.The show is a far cry in suspense and plot from the police/mystery videos I normally gravitate to (""Live"", ""Mr. Sunshine"" ""Voice""), but the likable characters and odd premise (very small group endowed with superpowers improbably arrayed against evil beings of unspecified number, likewise endowed) is interesting enough so far.

This moment deserves to be as well known as ""I'm the one who knocks"", it's that good. But there are other times where the plot does not make any sense, or the acting is over the top, and the special effects look too gimmicky (all the main special effects are quite well done). The main problem with it is that it is too long, and despite being too long, the ending feels forced. I'd recommend it, but it's a mixed bag. Leverton.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"I really wanted to like this series, it had good concept and many fighting action sequences-recipe for an entertaining series. The first few episodes started strong and kept me engaged but that's short lived. Boredom started to set in towards six episode as the reuse of the same themes and conflicts starts getting stale, There isn't enough mysteries to keep the story together so it drags on towards the end. There is a lot of slow close up moments of characters just being sad and repeating flashbacks of scenes we already seen. Though I don't expect fighting action sequences all the time, but there needs to be more substance in the story or character development otherwise it gets dull.Many ratings stated that the show tends to be cry me a river-which is accurate. There seems to be two modes for characters: tired and manic...no i between. The side characters are very flat and tends to only have one focus making them feel very boring after a brief whileOverly melodramatic and not enough substance to make this a great series.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

tt13273826,"I was agog this series would have been more a pure fantasy, which concentrated more on the world building as well as those Demon hunter development, but did not take politic sarcasm and power struggle as a main plot structure.I mean the director and screenwriter did fairly well on demonstrating the dark side of politic and the precarious boundary of being human or a demon. However, the superficial development of the world and character is the cons, whose exploitation is not deep and wide enough, to encourage viewer patiently watch till the end without being bored.One reason explains why I was so agog and why it piss me off is the Vietnamese title: The art of demon hunting and noodles cooking (translated). A round of aplause for Vnmese marketing team. But where is the art of demon hunting while it did not have a proper and decent care, as well as the poor dev of the protagonist in my point of view? Where is the art of making noodles which can make it become an essential aspect affecting on the plot? Instead it told a political story which should not have any relation to a fantasy world.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

The actors did really great job the only thing i did not like, 'is so mun' the lead actor was really annoying , over dramatic in some scenes wailing and bowling is not always touching, especially in the first season he's really brilliant actor dont get me wrong but the crying was honestly over that's why i said nice but not that good.",neutral,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"For a K drama it's not bad, but that's just if we are talking K dramas. This show is at the sophistication level of a middle school anime. That means the dialogue is cringe, but the most annoying aspect of this show is that there are no real adults, teachers, or police at all. Sure there are adult actors, but just like in anime there are no teachers anywhere. Bullies run the school. They kill people, beat people, hospitalize people almost every day. Every day a stab stab. It's totally ridiculous. There's police corruption. Ok, that's fine, but in this Korean city there is not one police officer that actually does their job. Murderers don't get arrested. Thieves don't get arrested. There is literally no law except for the law of the wild. The fact that it's only modestly overacted for a K drama doesn't mean that it isn't overacted. I can handle that, but the city in this K drama has about as much social order as one might expect from a tribe 20,000 years ago. It's a K-drama in a stone age city. It's beyond belief. Will Smith would smack the writers because I'm pretty sure Jada would be offended by how unbelievable this show is.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"I truly enjoyed this show so much! I usually like to binge-watch my shows, but this one I watched week to week, and its format really worked and kept me interested and excited for every new episode.The premise is interesting and fun, and the characters are just perfect across the board. So Mun is such a perfect protagonist; he is cute and brave and charming in all the right ways so you continually love and root for him the whole time. His ""found family"" is the best mix of characters; the cold but protective Ha Na, the gruff Mo Tak, and the sweet mom-like Ma-Ok make a wonderful group of very watchable character moments. Also a shout out to the over the top character of Jang Mul, who was a total scene stealer!The soundtrack is fun and upbeat/heroic with some beautiful sad songs thrown in for an even toned mix. The cinematography was well rounded, with some very decent and cool special effects. The bad guys are successfully bad without being too over the top (although the end fight definitely gave me those vibes). There were some cringe moments and a few times where the plot felt a bit redundant, but overall this was an extremely enjoyable watch. I would definitely recommend and even watch again!",neutral,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

tt13273826,"What this series does so well that many fail to do is tell a story well.In this series, we are introduced to complex characters and their motivations, fears, loves, losses. Each of the main characters is clearly fleshed out by the end of the series and that's what makes their successes and development so enjoyable. We aren't just expected to like them because they're conventionally good looking, we are presented with characters who are real. What many Korean dramas do is that they focus solely on young characters, and though our main protagonist is in high school, this does not take away from the complexities and the development that we get to see in the older characters, especially in Ms. Chu (I highlight her particularly because too many films and series will neglect the competent roles of women who aren't in their twenties).With well thought out twists and turns the story unfolds as the team works to catch evil spirits, but also fight against unjust city officials in Jungjin. If you're looking for a show that doesn't shy from the evils of people while also holding up the power of meaningful supportive relationships, this is for you.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

Without any trying to improve himself like So Mun when he joined the team for the first time. It's ridiculuous and annoying. Haha.2. Hana dan Do Hwi, Ohhh come on there's no chemistry between them.3. I don't understand why the host vessel can be controlled by the absorbed spirit.4. l miss the part where they summon an evil spirit which is very rare to happen in season 2.5.

tt13273826,"Cannot fault this series honestly. I watch a lot of kdrama and some take a few episodes to get good, some are really promising at first and then just get repetitive, others have a few episodes in the middle that start to drag or there's those that are good all the way up until a disappointing end. This drama doesn't fit into any of those categories because it stays consistently amazing all the way through. The storyline is gripping and develops well as everything begins to tie in together. Acting is on point. There is the perfect combination of humour, action and emotional scenes. The characters compliment each other well and it is great to see their characters develop and relationships with each other build. I love that the ending left it open for a season 2 which I would most definitely watch.",positive,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"
tt13273826,"(Minor spoilers for comic and Kdrama)As someone who's read the webcomic after watching both tv seasons, the show is bad as both an adaptation and on its own. There are many more counters in the comic. Comic actually has two Korean teams, and they both work together to defeat Ji Chungshin. Yujin, Hansuk, and Beomchan are no where to be seen in the show. I would've loved to see more counters besides the main cast. The other counters they have in the show get killed off immediately. In the comics, two Chinese counters survive instead of all of them dying.The counters are also much weaker in the show than in the comics. Motak is the strongest counter in all of Asia, and Ms. Chu is one of 5 healers in the world. All of the Korean counters have psychokinesis by the end of season 2 in the comics. Counters only need an hour of sleep a day. They don't need to sleep all night.A bunch of storylines in the comic are resolved much more quickly than the show. The show stretches out stuff for so long, and even add pointless storylines.Motak doesn't have a girlfriend in the comic, she was added to the show to be fridged.So Mun immediately decided to be a counter in the comic, show So Mun had to sleep on it. Comic Wigen immediately offers to let So Mun see his parents in YungMotak never goes back to being a cop, he has the captain just give him info on cases.There are 8 Korean counters in the comic, not just 5Evil spirits cannot transfer to new bodies in the comics, that was dumb of the show to do.Ji Chungshin is a villain all throughout Season 1 of the comic, and he's much more ruthless and scary.Pilkwang is only a minor villain in the comic, but the show makes him a main villain in season 2.Ma Juseok is actually introduced in the comics much earlier than the show. He's also not a family friend of So Mun, they don't know each other in the comics. His wife and kid died 7 years before the comic started, not during the story. Comic Juseok was already in prison for killing two scammersHana's family died because her mom got scammed by the Baekdoo real estate scam in season 2, just like Ma JuseokThe Yung spirits that the counters work with are all different races and ethnicities. Wigen is supposed to be German, and speaks German in Yung and So Mun can understand her. All spirits can talk to each other no matter the language they speak. Wigen speaks German, but So Mun hears it as Korean.They made So Mun such an arrogant prick in this show. So Mun in the comic is actually pretty humble, and he usually only fights when he has to. Comic So Mun actually apologizes to hosts when he hits them too hard, or he accidentally gets thugs to shoot each other.So Mun's friends have bigger roles in the comic, and they actually find out that So Mun is a counter and Ms. Choo doesn't erase their memories.The comic is also much more violent and the injures are brutal. So Mun even gets his hand chopped off by Ji Chungshin, and So Mun throws a knife into his Chungshin's eye. People lose limbs, break their arms and legs backwards, get their eyes gouged out, etc. The violence in the show is so tame.So Mun's CD player in season 1 has a payoff in the comic. In the show, it's just something for the bullies to steal from him.Jeokbong in the comic was actually useful and immediately agreed to be a counter, show Jeokbong is so annoying and useless. In the comic, Jeokbong was just as fast and strong as So Mun. But the show made him the weakest one.The comic has such good build up and is suspenseful throughout. So many twists and stuff that I didn't see coming. The show is so predictable and boring. I can't wait for Season 3 of the comic to finish so I can read it.",negative,"Action, Fantasy, Horror"

tt7094780,"This is an epic drama loosely based on the history of Korea from the perspectives of different but engaging characters. It is set in the time where Joseon (Korea) is fought over between different countries with America and Japan. The main character is played by Byung-Hun Lee, who is a phenomenal Korean actor and opposite of his role is Tae-ri Kim who is a newer actress. Byung-Hun Lee has many years of experience and is a well known Korean actor and he has appeared in numerous American films such as G.I. Joe and R.E.D. Both the actors bring fierce intensity to their roles with their well acted scenes and show such emotion through their lines, looks and even their stares. The supporting cast is also superb as they tell their own stories in this conflicted time. All in all the drama has great production value and truly keeps you mesmerized through it's weekly episodes. If you are a fan of Korean dramas or even if you aren't familiar with them, then this is a great series that you can watch.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"

tt7094780,"Do not let the cheesy title of this series fool you. This is extraordinary from many points of view. Historically, it is based on an actual setting, something very few people in this country would know about Korea, Japan and the USA. Within that framework, the clash of cultures, where values are different and honor prevails. The aesthetics of the production are something to marvel at. And then, the characters, who behave in accordance to strict rules surely strange to us behaving in ways that are, ultimately, quite fascinating. The love relation develops strangely, slowly and far from any courtship you could ever imagine. That gets performed by the two main characters in rather fascinating fashion as well. I do not recall seeing a picture where a still face and a minimal movement could unload so much expression. Actress Tae-ri Kim packs more beauty and feeling in still silence than any actress I can recall; she deserves stardom just for such incredible skill.
I have seen five episodes, and I am mesmerized.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"I have been watching movies and shows for over forty years. And, yes, this show is THAT good! After watching ""Descendants of the Sun"" only a couple of years ago, I was wondering how long it would be before another grand series came about; a series that resonates with the heart and soul; a series with a crisp story and fantastic performances by the actors. And along came ""Mr. Sunshine.""I can only think of a couple of series that are on par with ""Mr. Sunshine."" ""Band of Brothers"" is one and ""Descendants of the Sun"" is another.What is truly sad is that much of the world is quite ignorant when it comes to Korean history, I'm sure. It's a country that always seems to be at odds with Japan, and sometimes China and Russia as well. Its turbulent history has too often been plagued by invasions or other countries attempting to gain control of the small peninsula.""Mr. Sunshine"" tells of the time when Korea was, once again, fighting against Japanese occupation in the beginning of the 20th century. With virtually no real army to speak of and a king with little power on the throne, Korea or ""Joseon"" found itself relying on rebel guerilla tactics to try and prevent the Japanese from a complete takeover.Several characters find themselves unknowingly intertwined with each other at the outset of the series. One boy finds himself quickly orphaned and making his way to America to begin a new life. He returns to Joseon years later as a U.S. Marine Captain. Little does he know how the turn of events would pull him into the conflict between his previous homeland and Japan.The story's focal point is on three men who all happen to have feelings for the same woman, Go Ae-shin; a woman with a background as terrible and wrought with horror as the marine captain's. And yet, she is the heart and soul of the rebel forces. It is admirable and captivating to see this woman spearhead the rebellion, as well as her willingness to do whatever it takes to help her country. Tae-Ri Kim is perfectly cast, giving Ae-shin tremendous depth and complexity to her character.The cast is simply magnificent from top to bottom. Every role, no matter how large or small, is handled with immaculate precision and depth. However, there is, to my mind, one who stands out just a hair above the rest. And that is Byung-Hun Lee as Eugene Choi, the marine captain. The man has a regal distinction that very few actors in history have been able to pull off with such ease. He may appear to be emotionless in many of his scenes, but to make such an assumption would be wholly inaccurate. I've said many times: an actor/actress who can say more with their eyes than with words, is a true master at their craft. Byung-Hun Lee is such a performer. I cannot imagine anyone else playing this part with the integrity and depth that he brings to Eugene Choi.This is quite literally a ""Do not miss!"" series. With 24 episodes, each at about 75 minutes each, you are in for a wonderful treat. This is a show to savor. One might be wishing to quickly move on to the next episode, but I found myself stepping back and letting each episode soak within me instead. Like a perfect French dessert, you relish taking your time and savoring each bite. This is such a series.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"I am a huge fan of Korean shows, and this one is no exception. It is a beautiful story, with just as beautiful cinematography and rich characters.

tt7094780,"So I just finished the series. And this is the first thing I'm doing, writing this review , because it's so overwhelming.I loved the show from the beginning, but it was a little slow for my taste, but understandably because it's set in 19th century. So I dragged the first 15 episodes for around 2 weeks(I usually finish a season in couple of days), but the last 9 episodes are absolutely a blast. It picks up pace so quickly and things get in motion flawlessly. Now about the show.It's a masterpiece, storyline, plot, character development, acting , background score everything is absolutely amazing. Hats off to everyone for making something so amazing, it's definitely gonna etch a mark in the mind of viewers. Recommended to everyone, especially to those who don't watch korean dramas.

tt7094780,"The show is set in early 20th century Korea, few years away from being occupied by the Japanese Empire. The ruling Joseon dynasty has finally opened up their ports to Western powers and modernization is happening at an unprecedented pace for historically xenophobic Koreans. The setting is a playground for showmakers to flaunt the beauties of multiple cultures: Korean, Japanese, and Western. And they flaunt them masterfully, coupled with the beautiful Korean geography. For every episode I was overtaken by the aesthetics of the show.The show is also a subject of interest for history buffs. As Westerners watching the show, Korean history is probably the last thing we would be interested by. It is interesting to see how the show portrays adapting Korean people and how foreign involvements in Korea during the period played out. Also, the main character features a Korean-American Marine Corps captain. Sounds far-fetched? Surprisingly not, I have found. And, of course, the romance. I should not say too much, but I will say that the show will make you cheer for the male and female leads. In sum, this show offers no other show has to the greater international audience.

The cinematography work is stunning, the battle scenes are well choreographed and realistic, and there is some great acting in this show. The story line is shaping up to be an interesting one. There is a lot going on in this first episode, and you may find yourself frustrated at first, trying to figure out the timeline and characters, as there are flash forwards and more than one story line, but it looks at least for now, that they will start merging fairly quickly.

But this is the first time I have ever finished a series and immediately watched it again.P. S. I have just watched this yet again and still find it wonderful. Contrary to less positive reviewers, for me this series is packed with incident. In particular the last half dozen episodes fly by at a thrilling pace. I suppose the first half dozen episodes proceed more sedately, focused as they are on the beautiful love story at the centre of this drama, as well as developing the sparky relationships between the 5 main characters in this ensemble piece.

tt7094780,"Without a doubt, this is the best film (i.e., TV series) I have seen in the past five years. From a technical standpoint, it has everything; great story line & plot; directing, blocking, the acting was superb, cinematography techniques (...I was particularly impressed with the use of the camera angles including the use of the Dutch Tilt, slow-mo, top-down angles; movement through and across the frame, tracking shots and rack focusing); and the lighting; use of colors; variation in the music content; sound and visual effects. From an emotional point of view, I was continually surprised by the manner in which the audience is led into the use of symbolism as the story unfolds (great writing!). For five days, I was completely obsessed with the next episodes and the sequential development. On at least five different occasions, I was brought to tears and the finale left me exhausted emotionally. I spent the next two days, doing research on this film hoping to find something that would mention the film's success and developing my comments. Obviously, this was a big budget production and I sincerely hope that the producers and all those that had a vested interest consider this production an enormous success whether the economic return met their expectations or not. Congratulations and thank you. From an artistic perspective, this film is worthy of at least an Emmy Award - if not more. This film truly moved my heart.",unknown,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"This show started out quite well, though it took at least 3 episodes to understand what was even going on and where the story was headed. Or where I thought it was headed. Because this show can be divided into three parts and as a whole I couldn't manage to pinpoint what the message and the purpose of this show was.The first part is about the backstory of some key figures in this show and how and why their lives evolved the way they did. This part is really sad and bloody.The second part of this show nothing much happens. The story doesn't evolve much and you feel like you're going in circles because only small incidents keep happening but the problems with Japan and all really take a backseat in this part. So I'd say this is the part where the focus is on the main couple and the key characters around them. The thing is: even the relationship of the main couple didn't evolve much, they hugged three times and that's it. Don't expect to see a kiss either. It was kind of weird to see a story about a couple that was apart a lot and skipped most of the key milestones in romantic relationships but are supposed to be the loves of each other's lives.The third and last part is all about the Japan & Korea treaty and its consequences as in Korea losing their sovereignty and the so called righteous army trying to defend their country. Not much romance here either, only lots of blood and tragic deaths.So what was the purpose of this series? I don't really know. Neither the romance part convinced me much nor the historical part because major facts of how it even came as far as the treaty and Korea losing its sovereignty weren't well explained or depicted. The show made it seem like Korea and the emperor just sat back and watched until it was already too late. A quick research told me that this show has been openly criticized for having done poor research and not explaining and the depicting the events better and after watching this show I must say I agree.The heroism of some korean citizens, mainly the righteous army, seemed bittersweet in that context because you don't really understand why it had to come this far in the first place.Also, I hated the ending and not because it was bittersweet but because the female lead got more than she deserved in my opinion and because it was unfair to all the other amazing characters who deserved way better. But watch for yourself.Like I said, the cinematography was awesome and the OST on point.
Conclusion:
Great OST and cinematography, purpose/message of the show isn't clear, story lacks historical facts and better explanations of depicted historical events and how they came to be.",negative,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"Positives:
Beautiful costumes and setGood acting by most main characters (with exceptions)Beautiful cinematography, although some shots were overdoneNegatives:
Zero chemistry between two main characters, Kim tae Ri and Lee Byung Hun. The main story revovles around their love story, which can't be felt at any stage of the storyStory moves waaaaay to slow. The show needed a lot more action, twists, turns and more interesting dialogues/confrontations. There was so much potential with the historical context, that hasn't been used at all.Lee Byung Hun's revenge story wrapped up too soon/handled poorly. One of the few interesting elements in the story was written so poorly. His desire for revenge just somehow fizzled out and petered out to nothingEmbarrassing acting by all English-speaking actors, plus the French actor. Never seen so many poor actors in one drama. How can you can not make an effort to cast actual actors from America/France/Great Britain. I'm sure there are lot of talented actors that don't cost a fortune. Instead, it feels like the production team just picked up random foreigners they found on the streets of Seoul.Lee Byung Hun is a miscast. He knows how to play an action character, and I believed his rage when it came to his dead parents. Everything else (romance and humour) he just doesn't seem to be able to pull it off.Unncessary love triangle/quare(?). Was that really necessary? I guess so, since it is a K dramaToo many cliche K drama scenes (excessive use of flashbacks, soundtrack, and characters just staring at each other for long periods of time while they are about to cry)Overall: With all the hype, names, and money involved, definitely a huge disappointment. Regret having watched the whole show to be honest.",negative,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,This is the most beautifully done series I've ever seen. Each frame of each shot was like a painting.

Especially, the great performance produced by male lead Lee Byung-hun and female lead Kim Tae-ri are one of the delights of watching this drama. Mr. Lee is already a great actor well-known to the public. On the other hand, in my case, Ms. Kim first got to know her through this drama. The reason why I wait for this drama every weekend is her presence. Her beautiful acting and her elegant voice are one of the main factors that make the drama distinguishable from countless ordinary love story movies. Of course, the power of the drama script and the ability of the director are indispensable. The period of the drama is from 1990 to 1905.

They had great chemistry between each other. The characters were perfectly cast. And I almost broke my tv wanting to kill the villains (btw, played by wonderful actors who brought me to the brink of insanity). I was waiting fervently each week for the new episodes to air. It was torture not being able to binge-watch. Now that it's over, I think I'm going to have withdrawal symptoms develop soon.After being on the edge of my seat through the 24 episodes, I hated the ending, of course. But it was inevitable in this setting, I suppose. I didn't know much about this time period nor what happened to Korea historically (except the Korean War with US). And as the emperor lamented in one scene, no one in the world seemed to care about what was happening in this obscure part of the globe. No one knew. And those who did simply wanted no part in it. No one came to their aide. They suffered alone. I was so moved and compelled by the atrocities and sufferings that I had to google history to find out more.

tt7094780,"Like many tv shows it starts off with great potential but falls into the trap of trying to milk every last ounce out of it. It could easily have been done in half the time. With hours spent staring blankly at each other, whispering then wandering off, only to repeat the same scene again, and again, and again. The plot needs to be a lot more fast paced and twice the amount of action. It could have benefited from getting some better quality American actors also as the ones used may as well be made out of wood. It still has several episodes to go so could rescue itself somewhat but now I'm watching out of some sort of obligation with very few enjoyable/interesting moments each episode as it's so strung out. Repeating the same scenes in the same locations....",negative,"Action, Drama, Romance"

tt7094780,"I just finished watching the last episode and am already wishing it hadn't ended. The show was beautifully done, whether the acting, costumes, music or the best, cinematography. Episode 1 was a little confusing but you quickly settled into the story and characters in episode 2 and from then on, you are enthralled and transported to the turn of the century, Korea. I surely wish the title of the show was something a bit different especially as it had no real meaning. It may keep others from watching. It would be their loss. Perhaps the story is somewhat biased in making the Japanese characters to be so evil but certainly from Korea's perspective, it is understandable. And that antagonism is critical to the heart of the story. Lee Byung Hun did an absolutely stellar job with his acting, in all three languages. But he is not alone with the acting. All of the main characters showed great depth, particularly when they were not speaking. Their looks spoke volumes. Congratulations to all those on the show and behind the show. It truly was well done. And a big thank you to Netflix for bringing it to us.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"

tt7094780,"It's not often that a series have a great cast all around, even less that side characters are just as flossed out and interesting as the main cast.
This series made me love and cry over all in the cast.
I most say I am so impressed with the actors, it's one thing to act a movie in one language, and just use subtitles to explain other languages. But this takes it way further, as the main cast uses 4 for the most part, and around 6 is used in totlal in the show (one lines for some like Russian). It makes it so more believable and real, and my hat is off to the actors for pulling that off, not even Hollywood can really do that.You will love and hate the main cast, but the best part is that they are mostly in the grey area, where you see the good and bad off them all, and why they are like they are. And this is carried over to the side characters too, where even the servant boy have great lines and meaning behind actions.
The story is really touching, and bitter sweat all the way through. I only hope the people some of it it's based on lived just a little better lives, because to think this was not the case is heartbreaking.
Not many series makes me forget time, yet here I do. And it's cost me many late nights, where I simply had to see one more episode before calling it a night. The feelings where also hard and real.Now many will say it's only a few episodes, but look again each one is almost a movie on it's own, and it's stunning how they have manage to get a budget for this show. It is worth watching, even if Korean dram isn't for you, it wasn't for me either. But I was wrong.",,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"I've watched 15 episodes of this series and I just gave up because I found that the story was becoming boring and convoluted. I started disliking the characters after Eugene revealed to Ae-Sin that he was born a slave. I don't know why but it's really hard for me to like the characters. I didn't have a problem with them but there are just some weird interactions and I don't know if it's a Korean thing or what. I don't feel the chemistry between the two leads as much. It just feels like their relationship is something that's happening and not meant to be. When they shook hands and said ""Let's do it. Love"", I couldn't help wince. The storytelling is lacking because it's a little hard to keep up with events and there are too many filler scenes. Sorry to say this but I didn't like Hui-Seong because he felt like he didn't belong in the story. I'll admit that the scenery is beautiful and the acting is decent, but the foreign actors are a little off. The idea of a sheltered noble woman experiencing romance for the first time and an Asian-American perspective during the time period are interesting. When Joseph died, I only felt a little sad because we didn't really see Joseph that much so his death was a bit anticlimactic. I think this show should have explored the political and social relationships with America and Japan better because I felt like the main characters weren't as involved in the process as I would have liked. They should have expanded on the righteous army more and maybe they will in the next episodes but I was so confused when Eugene and Ae-Sin were recruited by the righteous army and were told that they couldn't see each other. The action scenes were okay and I know that Korean television tends to shy away from showing violence and they didn't have to show any but they just felt choppy. Also, the music is kind of inappropriate in some scenes, like when they play some indie song during a romantic scene. It's not a bad show but the editing can be choppy and you might feel lost at times. Sometimes it's hard to know what the plot is. I know that at episode 15, the American missionary died and Eugene is trying to solve the murder case and he knows that Dong-mae didn't do it. He suspects Yang-ju and that Wan-ik is behind the plan. The emperor wrote a letter to an American representative in Shanghai and he gave Joseph the job of delivering it but later he claimed that the letter was fake. I can't really tell what the side characters are doing. If you like this show, that's great that you can get enjoyment from it. :)",neutral,"Action, Drama, Romance"

That being said, this show is absolutely incredible, even for HBO caliber TV shows. The acting, dialogue, scenery, screen play is absolutely top notch. Some of the best I've ever seen. Lee Byung-Hun has been my favorite Korean actor for quite some time. His portrait as a U.S. Marine is absolutely incredible. I'm highly impressed on how much his English has improved over the years.

But history aside, the stories of the characters is what kept me hooked! To say the last few episodes had me sobbing is an understatement. The candid pictures of the cast out of character at the end of the last episode made me feel better.Finally, the cinematography in this film has blown me away. I am not someone who talks about things like 'cinematography' when I talk about movies. There were so many shots that were absolutely breathtaking.

tt7094780,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this film series. My wish would be for it to be in English. But my fear is that it would ruin the consistent poetry of the Korean language. It's eloquent even as it uses contemporary expressions in the subtitles. It would be interesting to hear the story in its historical context. For example, the series Deadwood uses such language that matches perfectly with the expressiveness of the language used during the pioneering era in the American westward expansion. The whole soul of a language is so very important and difficult, and Shakespeare proves that easily. There are long pauses in the dialogue which tries to emphasize the subtextual meanings in both the language as well as the scene itself. And the cinematography is elegant and filled with gracious wisdom, making the long pauses worth the wait/weight of the meanings between words. It is both an intellectual and spiritual experience. Some may say it is soap opera, but this is a masterpiece of historical costume drama with the most eloquent balance between all aspects of making a film work. The actors are so perfectly matched as they experience one another in character. My favorite balancing act in the project is the consistent humour that I've begun to recognize in great epic Asian film projects. Jackie Chan comes to mind when a dramatic moment astonishingly becomes the Keystone Cops and the wonder of Charlie Chaplin. The character actors are genius as their dialogues expand the story using the most powerful and long-lasting aspect of film theory/storytelling. These moments are climactic and as such get us ready for the next constellation of plot structuring. I guess I'm trying to say that I feel the intensity of effort and belief going into the project, and that alone makes it worth watching.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"

It was just perfect.I have watched my fair share of Korean series but this was something else. The asthetics, the storytelling, the casting and a special mention to the music, I got immersed in every bit of it.The story moved layer by layer slowly showing us Joseon getting into grips of foreign powers and ultimately being toppled by the Japanese. You could feel every bit of despair the characters felt. You could understand each and every character's motivation behind their actions. And by the end of the series you would be rooting for the protagonists from the depth of your heart that maybe they could pull off the impossible. And that's what felt like a gut punch in the end (not in a bad way). It kept things realistic. It didn't tweak the story just to please the viewers and every death felt meaningful and justified. The sadness I felt with each character's death, I don't think I will ever feel such emotions at a fictional characters' death.Now to the casting. Each of the leads played their character to perfection. Special mention to Lee Buying Hun and Yoo Yeon Seok- I just got my best fictional characters of all time in them. Kim Tae-ri carried herself well and gave her career best performance. That last cry of Choi Yu-jin was just heart wrenching and is still ringing in my ears.To sum it up I don't think I will watch any drama which will reach the level of Mr. Sunshine (I hope I'm wrong). The close second that I can think of is Crash Landing on You. This is my fourth viewing of Mr. Sunshine and it still brings out emotions like I am watching it for the first time. Finally I decided I should write a heartfelt review which this story rightly deserves.Highly recommended to everyone !",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"I composed the following review midway through the series:""Forgive me: I am not familiar with Korean writers and the Korean literary and film tradition, so I speak from profound Western ignorance. I have to draw on the American, British and Russian literary tradition to convey my review and strong recommendation. If Jane Austen got together with Leo Tolstoy, James Fennimore Cooper, James Branch Clavell and Joss Whedon to write a television show about Joseon in the late 19th and turn of the 20th century, I would expect the outcome to look something like Mr. Sunshine. This is the most layered, beautiful and elliptical story I have ever witnessed, and the comedic interludes will have you howling in laughter. There are minor turnoffs for an American audience: for example, Teddy Rooseveldt speaks with a decidedly not-American accent as do many of the soldiers. The titles translated from Korean to English sometimes don't match the visuals. But the slight glitches from time to time are understandable and almost not worth mentioning. This is my favorite TV ever, subtitles and all.""Now that the series is over, I stand by the earlier review for the first maybe 18 episodes. For maybe the last six episodes, the practicalities of ending a TV show, as well as the writer's singular view of how to follow through on her repeated warnings about a sad ending (in keeping with the horrors/atrocities of history) drive the show forward to its conclusion. If, like me, you live the characters' love and joy and hunger and grief and loss, the last maybe six episodes indelibly etch lessons about history, but come at too huge a price to be considered ""entertainment.""",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"

I really felt connected with all the characters in the show and I loved how the director was able to show all the different sides/kinds of selfless love people can have for each other without any of the characters barley making contact with each other through the use of music and painting like scenes... it has had me hooked on this show for months!

I especially didn't like how Eugene Choi died at the end. So you claim there are no more bullets. Meanwhile Ae Shin just killed a bunch of soldiers. Why couldn't she or one of her teammates pick up a dead soldier's gun? Speaking about the teammates, where did they disappear? Why didn't Eugene demand the soldiers drop their guns? Why did Eugene have to go on the last train car as the enemy soldiers? Why couldn't he bluff that he more bullets? Up until this point in the series, Eugene Choi had been pretty sharp, outwitting his enemies. He had common sense. He completely lost it in the end. He panicked and broke completely out of character. I initially gave this series a higher score but dropped it after thinking about the ending.",negative,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"The drama is unfolding nicely and there is a lot of world building, which is always an enjoyable experience for great films and dramas. I'm enjoying the story progression but I am disturbed by seeing yet another romantic K-drama where the male and female leads have a large age gap. Playing off a 20 year age gap like it's just an everyday romance is a joke (even Jerry Seinfeld couldn't get away with it in real life!) These May-December romances are the exception and not the rule (unless the culture is very patriarchal or practices child marriage). Women want to date their peers not their fathers. I find this kind of casting to be exploitative of young women and I hope K-drama directors will pay attention to how unpleasant this is for members of their female viewing audience (especially for older women who want to reminisce about their youth--they prefer to fantasize about a young and handsome man!) Imagine a 50 year old female lead paired with a 30 year old male lead? If this sounds preposterous, then you know how some women feel about a much younger woman playing the love interest of a much older man. Yes, we find it disturbing and disappointing. It was uncomfortable enough (just like the ""Goblin"" drama) that I switched to another series with romantic leads that I can actually enjoy fantasizing about.",negative,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"To place this awe-inspiring story in an earthly labeled box would be an injustice. It's an extraordinary, collective love story of interconnected souls---of the so-called ""good"" and ""bad""---that stem from the extremely rare, Unconditional, True Love (of self and others).Though the story also includes a love story between two individuals, it's not the typical one that's been diluted throughout the ages, and often based on the very common, conditional love and/or lust.When viewed with an OPEN mind and heart---aka integrated Mind/Heart of Soul/Spirit within---you will truly appreciate the showing of the FULL rainbow spectrum of human aspects that exists within all of us (to varying degrees), ranging from the contrast/duality/polarity of the so-called good and bad, right and wrong, light and dark, etc. As you pay close attention, you will realize that experiencing any form of duality helps us to deeply appreciate its opposite. For instance, we can never experience what we call Unconditional Forgiveness UNTIL we've experienced the opposite energies such as heartbreak, betrayal, anger, rage, hatred, and/or sadness; hence, even the so-called ""negative"" aspects have a Divine purpose to highly benefit interconnected Life, despite outer appearances.As collective humanity, our ego selves---conditioned by society since childhood---are often quick to judge everything, everyone and their mamas and grandmamas, and especially anything unknown or somewhat foreign. And this show can remind us to clearly see, and intensely feel, the bigger picture with an expanded perspective.Earthly labels such as race, ethnicity, gender, social status (e.g., slave vs royalty), positions, ranks, financial background, education level, family history, etc. gracefully move with the ebb and flow of Life as they play the game of separation consciousness vs unity consciousness, collide and then break way, and even gently and beautifully merge as One.I'm very grateful that the creators incorporated magnificent fireworks of all invaluable, human emotions (our inner compass revealing our authentic state) and feelings (language of the Soul), which are Divine, precious gifts given to humanity while experiencing the physical world on planet Earth.In this very fast-paced, instant gratification society that we live in, it's a breath of fresh air to experience highly creative cinematography and storytelling at its finest. This impressive series include some of the following soul-igniting themes that radiate humanity (and its significant opposites that make them stand out in the spotlight): fascinating, lovable and memorable characters, inner-strength, courage, determination, resilience, honor, loyalty, deep understanding, pure compassion, empathy, unconditional forgiveness, true friendship, outstanding teamwork, fiery passion, freedom to make a choice, wild adventures, intelligence (mental and emotional), patience, gratitude, deep appreciation, charisma, refreshingly honest communication, heartfelt verbal and nonverbal expressions (like gentle yet intense eye contact), joy in various forms (like free-spirited playfulness), inner-peace, wisdom, the dance between the material and spiritual worlds, and last but not least...profound, Unconditional Love.By the way, the creators also did an excellent job of integrating humor into various scenes in Divine perfect timing and order. So don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling, chuckling, laughing, and even rolling and/or holding your stomach due to hilarious moments. ^_^So far, this is hands down THE BEST Korean drama I've ever watched, and I'm a Japorean-American who lived in Korea most of my childhood, and was also stationed there for three years while in the Army. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to this amazing creation.

It would have been fast paced if was reduced to the standard 16 episodes...so many scenes can be cut....There was no suspense at all that you will be eager to continue and watch the next episodes...it's tantamount to a boring show....The romance between the two stars seems to be awkward like a January-December or a father-daughter affair...the guy is 50 and the girl is very young at 30....I don't find it sweet or romantic...What I like about the show is the Cinematography, Costumes and I like the music theme Greensleeves. The show is realism and not fantasy and the use of flashbacks is limited only unlike other shows which consumes most of the time using flashbacks.....On the over-all, it's a good show and recommended if you have patience to watch 24 episodes.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"Joseon Korea began to be influenced by Japanese expansion in the late 1800s which is where this series & the story of our main character begins. It continued until the end of WWII, however, this series only follows its central characters into the early 1900s. As is typical for dramatized historical pieces found in most countries the host nation is simplistically portrayed as courageous & righteous - basically really good guys while the enemy is stereotypically mostly immoral, nasty, brutish, evil baddies. An obvious hard sell on patriotism. Our three main nation protagonists are the Koreans (half good, other bad); Americans (mostly bad, some good); Japanese (almost all bad).Six dvds (24 episodes) for those who have a lot of excess time to spend watching a bit of history packed with a lot of stretched-out, prolonged filler of conflicts & romantics.

tt7094780,"Upon a quick glance at the title and the promotional poster, you're probably already thinking wow, this sure looks underwhelming! Well, dare I say that those were precisely my first thoughts - but now, I don't even hesitate for one second when someone asks me whether this drama is any good, because my answer will always be the same, and that is: 'exceptional' doesn't even begin to cut it.Initially, I thought the premise was very lacklustre - set in the early 1900s, this mini-series focuses on Righteous Army activists fighting for Korea's independence against foreign forces, but the more I watched, the more I began to realise how fascinating this was. Not only did it act as a device to help viewers establish the rationale behind each of the character's motives, but it also contributed to the story's development in more ways than I could have imagined. The idea of a premise is that it lays down the most basic foundation of a writer's work, and just like a movie post or an illustrated cover of a book, it paints a simple image of what's inside, but not much more. And here's the thing, it's incredibly unfortunate to still see so many K-drama writers (whether old or new to screenwriting) fall into this rut when it comes to bringing an idea to life. However, for Mr. Sunshine screenwriter Kim Eun-sook, this doesn't ever appear to be a problem she faces.Kim is one of the most accomplished and sought after screenwriters in the industry, and it's a no-brainer as to why this is the case. In the last 10 years, she has written the script for some of the most commercially successful dramas: Secret Garden (2010), A Gentleman's Dignity (2012), The Heirs (2013), Descendants of the Sun (2016), Goblin (2016), The King (2020), and this drama included. Yes, she may have incorporated overused clichés in a few of her written work (e.g. rich guy-poor girl, evil mother-in-law, etc), but at the same time, it's evident she continues to develop narratives which are so unique and enthralling; a talent which is unsurpassed in the industry. Unlike many writers whose dramas flopped, each one of her projects has stood the test of time, and this drama is no exception.But the success of Mr. Sunshine ought to be shared equally with director Lee Eung-bok, whose creative direction and vast use of cinematic techniques in this drama was seriously not like anything I've seen before. Together, they raised viewers' awareness of Korea's history, and shed light on those deemed peripheral in society. Many with very little understanding or are quick to judge will say that everything portrayed is historically inaccurate or rubbish, but what these people fail to acknowledge is that these very cruel and tragic events did happen, and whether or not this drama perfectly encapsulated that 101% accuracy is irrelevant. Mr. Sunshine was a cleverly crafted masterpiece to simply put, and I have no doubt the producer called in a historian to ensure the historical and factual basis of the premise was presented in such a way that had more to do with the storyline and character development, rather than the accuracy value it would have added to the plot.The storyline was wonderfully perplexing, with each dramatic turn adding all these unexpected twists. It was fuelled with long-awaited revenges, political debacles, and palace shambles, all atop a crumbling social class system and a country's disastrous attempt at stopping the Japanese from invading. Unlikely friendships formed, loyalties tested, identities challenged, and moral compasses questioned, but till the very end, not one person flinched, nor did they flee their allegiance to join another simply for the sake of love or friendship. But what I really appreciated about Mr. Sunshine would be this: the delivery of a poignant love story without the need for any kissing scenes.I'm not going to lie when I say that there's got to be smooching involved to make the chemistry somewhat convincing, but even when there was none of that here, I wasn't the slightest bit concerned or disappointed. Because when there was grief, I ugly cried; when there was suspense, I went numb; when characters embraced, my heart melted; when a character experienced pain, I too felt my heart being ripped out of my chest; whenever a villain or antagonist appeared, my insides burned with rage; when a character showed their quirks, I chuckled with amusement; and last but not least, when a scene was so profoundly sad, it did more than just move me beyond tears.I also admired Kim's screenwriting, because instead of cheapening the plot with unnecessary exchanges, I found myself immersed in eloquent poetry and an engaging dialogue that actually built towards something, whether it was revealing important information about a course of action or disclosing a certain character's disposition. And every time a flashback or sentimental object re-appeared, I knew what purpose it served because the story behind it was so powerful that it became an etched memory (e.g. Lady Yun's norigae (ornament), ragged shoe floating in the well, wooden music box, red paper windmill, etc). The stunning cinematography was also something to marvel at; not just acting as a visual aid, but in creating this immersive historical experience. With a beautifully composed soundtrack to match, I was well and truly enchanted. (Two songs in particular which struck a chord was Park Hyo-shin's ""The Day"", and Baek Ji-young's ""See You Again""; both of which evoked so much soul, emotion, and lyrical meaning).But what this drama could really not have done without was the outstanding performance of its talented cast (whether lead or supporting). The main cast comprising of Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-ri, Yoo Yeon-seok, Kim Min-jung and Byung Yo-han all had a unique charisma and stage presence about them, and I'm so thankful that their talents did not go to waste when they auditioned for their respective roles as Eugene Choi, Go Ae-shin, Gu Dong-mae, Kudo Hina and Kim Hui-seong. To be able to see each individual connect with their characters by immersing themselves in the script was one thing, but then the ability to translate and deliver the right amount of expressive energy and a certain personality on-screen was another. Thus, it was really pleasing to see that actor was emotionally, mentally, and physically invested in whatever challenges their character faced.Not only did Mr. Sunshine record the 6th highest rating for any given episode in cable television (previously coming in 3rd place before the release of Hotel del Luna (2019), Crash Landing on You (2019-20) and the World of the Married (2020)), but it also netted an overall average rating of 12.955%, making it the second highest-rated K-drama of all times in cable television. What makes this latter figure far more significant than the first is because not only does it reflect the popularity of the series during its broadcast, but it also evidences strong audience engagement.No doubt that Mr. Sunshine is probably my most favourite drama to date (along with Crash Landing on You and Signal), but if you ever just need to know why again, please don't hesitate to re-read this review.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"

But if you don't mind your dramas to be kind of fictional and you like to focus on the current story that you are watching, then you won't be disappointed with this drama.However, even though the story was good and very impressive, the drama had a slow start. It felt like it was dragging on for the first half. In the second half, fortunately, it picked up. The action scenes were more plenty and the plot thickened. Kudos for the ending as well, as it was bold to conclude things like this.Moreover, the performances were excellent from all the actors and they were many many characters in this drama, so it was harder to pull off concistant performances from all of them. One thing that bothered me though, was the constant changing of the language of the dialogues throughout the drama.

tt7094780,"There's little I can add to the glowing endorsements others have already given this show, but let me just say, if I could give it 15 stars, I would. Even if you aren't a big fan of period pieces (which this is), it still sucks you in, compelling you to race through episode after episode, though reluctantly because you can't bear to see it all end. I became so emotionally invested in the characters, I was deeply disappointed to learn that virtually all of them were fictional.I dare anyone to get through this show without laughing, crying, cheering and marveling. EVERYTHING about it is just that phenomenal; the script, the cast, the cinematography, the costumes, the soundtrack (a feature in and of itself), and especially the two main leads. Even when they're not talking, they are still communicating loud and clear. It is truly a masterpiece, and the ending, though more bitter than sweet, felt realistic.For those who feel the story/emotions were lacking, I'm guessing cultural differences are to blame. Asian dramas in general are typically far more restrained and subtle than our western ""instant gratification"" programs. On top of that, a structural feature of Asian languages is sentence ambiguity (unlike English, for instance, which spells everything out). This ambiguity allows for richly layered word play, full of subtext and double meanings, which regrettably fail to translate. The scene where Eugene runs into Ae-Shin under the blossoming plum trees is a prime example. In short, if you try to skim through this show using the same viewing techniques that work for American shows, you will miss 75% of what is actually happening and being said.Normally I would give a romance-type k-drama a separate kiss/chemistry rating, but aside from the fact that there were no actual kisses to rate, in the context of this story, it also doesn't seem right. So I'll skip it this time.Lastly, huge props on the rifle vs sword duel end of episode 11. It was thrilling, s3xy and artistic, and ranks among my favorite girl vs girl fight scenes of all time (I half hoped they would fight again so I could see more).To say I recommend this show would be a gross understatement.

I see the patriotism and willingness to die for country of the Korean terrorists, or are they patriots? In the US we like to call them terrorists. That Korea has managed to survive through the centuries as a fairly small country says a lot about its people, and a country that was between the extremely expansionistic Japanese and Russians, and the Chinese.

Not a documdrama by any means and some liberties taken with the history, but also the producers have tried to insert real context and personalities into the 1900-era Hanseong. 24 episodes start out as a charming relationship story with some humour and grit, served with a multi-lingual and multi-cultural flair; there's a dramatic peak around episode 16, then settles a bit before the story and action gets darker and bloodier in episodes 19-21. And since it is known Japan does annex Korea eventually it can be expected everyone has a happy ending by the Finale. The leads carry it off well, but a bit too much freeze frame emoting and overall the odd unusual K-drama platonic love story taking place over several years. Supporting actors include a manga-stylized yakuza bad-boy and the rich, sensitive artsy-type, as well as a large cast playing recognizable stereotypes from other K-dramas. Depiction of the Japanese may be a little over the top, but hey, they have their own TV networks and shows if they want to tell their side.",negative,"Action, Drama, Romance"

tt7094780,"I expected the ending but it didn't hurt any less. Beautiful cinematography, an outstanding cast of actors, tear-jerking soundtrack and solid writing, all of which moved me to tears. I applaud the actors for bringing to live so vividly the director's and writers' vision of this show. Every character has their purpose and because there are 24 episodes, it gave the writers more room to explore the characters. I honestly loved the supporting characters a lot and their character development was so bittersweet to watch.And probably my favourite thing in this show is the friendships forged between the characters, particularly between Eugene and the other male characters. It was such a joy to watch them interact because they had different personalities so it was always humourous when they were in the same room. Speaking of which, I really appreciate how the writers incorporated humour in this show with the help of some key characters as well as Eugene's natural charm. And the female characters in this show are so badass and I love the fact that they weren't love rivals and there wasn't any unnecessary drama about them fighting over a man.",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"

Mr.Sunshine has probably been the most exciting K-drama I have ever viewed. Its full of action, adventure,mesmerizing locations,an excellent story line and the best cast the country has to offer. A lot can be said about this show which still won't be enough. Once you start watching you can't stop binging. I rate it a 10/10",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt7094780,"Watch Mr. Sunshine. Then watch it again, especially if you're English speaking, as faces and names can be really confusing at first. But this is one of the most beautifully filmed dramas ever - and I mean from anywhere in the world. The cast is superb, and the story so compelling that I fell in love with the characters, wanting the history that this dramas is based on to be different, better, happier. I'd name the actors, except that each role was so perfectly cast that I would just be copying the cast list.This is the most perfect film series I've ever seen. If you're a fan of historical dramas, don't miss it. Even if you're not it's well worth watching!",positive,"Action, Drama, Romance"
tt8242904,"I thought this show had plenty of strong points, but since they have already been covered in other reviews, I will limit my comments to the aspects in which IMO this film stands out from its peers:1) The main leads. There are plenty of other celebrities whom I personally find more attractive than PSJ and PMY. However, by the end of the first episode I was totally in love! Their couple chemistry was insane and their performances (both together and alone) were amazing. They are by far the best thing about this show.2) A Truely Couple-Oriented Plot. Unlike many romance stories which focus on the complications of a love triangle, this one kept its focus firmly on the main pair, despite the potential for a triangle. Additionally, it realistically highlighted many of the struggles a normal couple would face in developing a new relationship (especially inexperienced first-timers), but kept the contrived angst to a refreshing minimum with (gasp!) actual communication.3) Plenty of Adult Romantic Payoff! Most mainstream K-Dramas tend to stick to the ""G-Rated Love"" standard, with (sometimes frustratingly) limited romantic contact between the leads and little resolution to any sexual tension. This show, however, follows through on all the buildup, rewarding viewers with 6+ very invested kiss scenes, as well as (gasp!) a passionate bedroom scene.If you are looking for something ""fresh"" or ""unique,"" this probably won't be your cup of tea. But if you are in the mood for a classic, RomCom K-Drama with an old school fairytale ending which pulls no punches in the physical contact department, you would be hard pressed to find one more satisfying than this. Highly Recommended!",positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"
tt8242904,"Firstly the chemistry between the leads is successful. A connection is palpable . They are both good at making fun of their characters quirks. PSJ is quite funny and well cast as the narcissistic arrogant VP. The way he treats her initially is refreshingly politically incorrect. Its nice how they show how valuable she is. PMY is sweet and very attractive as the long suffering secretary. She has an expressive face unlike some of the actresses popular today. Like the way she smiles
through his conceited remarks. Their love isn't as timid as in many K drama comedies are. Beyond first base for a change.
The comedy is good in how he interacts with her family and the wedding preparations. Also the workplace issues about them dating are funny. The dramatic kidnap back story and his relationship with his brother is quite diverting. What does not quite work is the side stories about the colleagues. Some jokes are painful and repetitive.For a romantic comedy it is quite enjoyable. Some episodes could have
been shortened.",neutral,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"
tt8242904,"Ahhh, yep, another favourite K-drama here for me. At first you see mostly the funny side of things, with the hero being so amazingly arrogant you just have to laugh.The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable from the start, but the most amusing aspect for me was the hero getting a rude awakening when he has to come to terms with his secretary's decision to resign her position ... after nine long years of being a well paid servant.He's baffled, confused, stunned, because who wouldn't want to be at his beck and call all day, every day?That's what we see at first, but as the series progresses we go a lot deeper into the shared history of both lead characters (that goes right back to childhood), and inevitably take a more sympathetic view toward that arrogant hero. The story is moving.I will definitely be watching this series again, because I adored it the first time. Great acting, and numerous captivating side stories to watch unfold as well.",positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

The love stories are similar but still leave the viewer spellbound and anxious for the next episode.

I am extremely picky with kdramas & I honestly wish I wasn't since it's so hard to pick something that will grab my attention in the first few minutes of a drama lol but man oh man this was amazing! If you're looking for a pinkish drama, light hearted rom com with a bit of suspense - THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. This drama gave me absolutely every single thing I could ever ask for in a perfect drama - great chemistry between the two main leads ( who are incredibly attractive btw ) , lots of comedy and lots & lots of kissing scenes - which were adorable to watch *squeals* PSJ is an extremely talented actor & so is PMY, I was so impressed with this drama, the director did an amazing job and so did all the actors. Each week I was looking forward for each and every single episode & I was never disappointed or ever bored. Did I mention the chemistry was fantastic?

tt8242904,"This is one of the best romantic comedies with a dash of drama that I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's funny, romantic af and the chemistry between the leads is off the charts. The male lead is fantastic, the female lead is super cute and the supporting cast is awesome too. Basically, Secretary Kim has been working for nine years as the assistant of the Vice Chairman of a company and now she's resigning. Why? She's paid off the debts of her father and sisters, and is ready to have a life of her own. For nine years, she's been at the Vice Chairman's beck and call, at night, in the weekend and even during holidays. On top of that, her boss is self-absorbed to the point of narcissism. So, she's done.The Vice Chairman is shocked when she announces her decision to quit - because he thinks he is the best boss and most perfect guy ever - and immediately starts to come up with schemes to get her to stay. Somehow he gets it into his pretty little head that Secretary Kim is in love with him, so he starts to woo her. With hilarious results, because she hates his guts.Seriously, just watch this series! It's so good and so satisfying. You'll laugh and cry and sigh (mostly laugh and sigh, though, at how adorable the main couple is). The male lead is gorgeous and hilarious, the female lead has got a great evil smirk, the sound effects are the best and the side stories of the other characters are absolutely worth your time too. I'm probably just going to watch the whole series again real soon, because watching anything else after this can only lead to disappointment.",positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"
tt8242904,This is one of the best romcoms I have ever watched. It sets itself apart from most series. The creators incorporated sound effects to portray the actors emotions which will definitely bring you laughing and rolling on the ground sometimes. I enjoyed the romance a lot and the history that the main characters shared. This series has its hard and tough moments as well. The series pretty much wrapped up before the last two episodes. I liked that as it gave me two episodes as the ending to fully enjoy. Series do not do this at all as most give us sometimes nothing more than 2 minutes.,positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

tt8242904,"What's Wrong with Secretary Kim is just an okay drama. It has a cute approach to the story, that also involves some mystery about a kidnapping and a chilhood drama, but they kind of overeploit that theme and it got tiring towards the end. The romance, for me, it was so so. There was chemistry and everything, but the script didn't help to create the right mood. In the end, the romance scenes seemed forced to be funny when they weren't. The performances, in addition, were nice and enjoyable at least. The side stories interesting as well. Overall, the drama is just a cute romance drama and it doesn't really have any originality in it to make it the great drama that most viewers claim it to be.",negative,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

The actors have done a marvelous job, they portrayed their characters exceptionally. Loved every bit of it. The romance, the comedy, the sorrounding mystery between the two brothers, everything was fabulous! Just give it a shot. You'll regret later if you don't.

Will look forward more his drama.For once I watch a kdrama that has no deceit, lies, betrayal & unnecessary back-stabbing! Just 1 scene of office gossip. All these unnecessary storyline are so tiresome & dull to watch. The same lies & betrayal again & again. Even the rich chaebol in this drama is like ordinary people no unnecessary extravagant that need to be flaunt. No unnecessary condescending remarks because she is a secretary.

tt8242904,I watch a lot of K-drama since COVID 19 it's all I watch 9 out 10 times. They're well made and entertaining. This drama always came up on my recommended shows but I always ignored it. But after not having much to watch i decided to try it out and see why it had such a high rating.I must say I was immediately hooked from ep1-11. The story was done and there was nothing more to add. Sure an ep12 was needed to show how they ended up after everything had come to light in ep11. All of which could've been done in one episode instead of 5 more pointless content.12episodes K-dramas are so good for that very reason. This could've been one of the best shows ever but they ruined it by making it so long and pointless in the end. I literally had to skip through the last 3 episodes as it just became a whole lot of drivel. I just wanted it to stop by the time it was done. I had lost the love and connection for the leads by then.Business Proposal and Perfect Marriage:Revenge are 12episode shows. They're well made and don't waste time adding unwarranted dialogue and scenes that add nothing to the show. It's such a shame really because this could and should've been a classic.,neutral,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

tt8242904,"I cried watching episode 15 literally. Even though the drama didn't have much deeper story and the mystery got solved my episode 12, I still loved the meaningless laughter and romance after that. Cause maybe that's what I was longing to watch. Watch a guy propose 5 times to his girl until she says yes. Watch a guy fulfill his girl's bucket list. Watch a guy convince the girl's family. Maybe I love a show off guy like Young Joon who wants to show the world the love of his life and not hide it.

The entire cast was great, but PSJ and PMY were the absolute best that I've seen in a long time. This series will tug at your heart strings.

tt8242904,"What's Wrong with Secretary Kim was on my watch-list for a very long time, and I initially didn't really have an interest. Then I saw Park Seo-Joon in Itaewon Class and fell in love with his shy character and amazing acting skills. So I gave this a shot.Overall, I feel that this show is quite overrated. Based on reviews I was expecting a lot, and perhaps that's why I felt underwhelmed. I liked the kidnapping subplot - I think it was done well, made sense, and added a tragic undertone to our couple. But this subplot was resolved rather early, and it felt like the will-they/won't-they aspect also reached it's climax too early. I got bored and skipped through the last two episodes. The fatal flaw for me was the lack of chemistry between our couple - in my opinion Min-Young felt very stiff towards Seo-Joon. Every time they kissed it seemed like she just wasn't into it. Seo-Joon was always very sweet and into her, so I'm not sure if she just didn't like him in real life and that translated onto the screen, or if she just felt awkward filming those types of scenes - I haven't seen her in anything else so I'm not sure what to make of it. I seem to be in the minority here, especially since apparently people thought they were a real couple because of this show, so it might just be me. Either way, I didn't particularly like this show.",negative,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

Yes, male lead is sort of narcissistic but it felt more humorous to deal with this issues vs true egotistical.The female lead was strong with her own resolve to be herself. There was a serious backstory that made the secretary to love interest more valid. The kissing scenes, finally leads that compliment each other and not looking like dead fish when they are being close to each other . The passion felt true and made each kiss and scene feel so real.

tt8242904,"This had all the potential to be a truly fantastic drama with it's dynamic casting, bright energy, and quirky sound effects, but halfway through, I found myself not caring whether or not I finished the series. I was way more invested in the side character's romances at the end.I loved the first episode and how feisty Mi So was in her resignation. This series would have been greatly improved if Mi So actually got to live out her mission of discovering what makes her happy, and THEN came back to the office. I also had a huge problem with her immediately being okay that the Vice Chairman had lied to her for years about his identity and there was never any trust issues in their relationship stemming from that.The kidnapping subplot was interesting, but it was resolved too quickly, leaving the brother to be a limp and useless character ultimately. It would have been nice if he would have been able to find new inspiration or romance after discovering his true identity. Ji Ah was a huge fan of his writing, so that could have been an interesting romance to explore to give the brother character a use other than shopping with mom.The goofiness and comedy kept me going ultimately. I loved the Jane The Virgin style energy and the heightened drama. It would have been a better series ultimately had Mi So had more time at the beginning to explore her free will instead of being bulldozed by Vice Chairman from date 1. She never had a choice. Even though he was putting in the effort, I didn't find it to be a healthy mutually loving dynamic. She was never excited about him. She wanted to hide the relationship from her sisters, her dad, the office, everyone, and she wasn't even excited to plan her own damn wedding. The poor writing was a waste for two talented leads.",negative,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

I think I was intrigued but there wasn't much depth even to the side characters except their romances. After they built up the romance for the main characters, it also seemed like they tried to build up the tension. But unfortunately the scenes gave us something to miss out on. As progressive as some other K-Drama shows have become when it comes to intimacy, it's also still disappointing that this brushed on intimacy but ultimately was your typical romance comedy type of show. Towards the last few episodes, it was painfully boring to watch. It was also, like the others said, the backstory was resolved too early. They dragged out the romance and comedy much too long for the original plot to hold much meaning towards the end. Again, it was worthwhile to see Park Seo Joon acting again, but I absolutely hated how stiff her personality they made Park Min Young to be.

tt8242904,"This tv series gives off a really good vibe, providing viewers with a heartwarming melodrama without being too in-your-face. The writers don't get on your nerves; they simply deliver what you want: a feel-good romcom with a cheerful tone. Having said that, despite its many merits, I personally couldn't get past some points that stopped me from giving it a higher rating.Firstly, the chemistry between Park Min-young and Park Seo-joon, while not entirely missing, didn't click with me. This could also be partly because of writing issues, as the story didn't create enough special moments between their characters and specially the narcissist aspect of the male lead was sometimes too much and ruined the mood. Either way, in the end I feel the main leads didn't have the right chemistry but that's just a personal take.A bigger issue came up in the last few episodes (the last 30% of the show), where the story completely lost its pacing and I felt the writers ran out of material. They didn't seem to know what to do when characters overcame the previous challenges, and when it was time to witness their hard-earned happiness we were presented the same old formula from earlier episodes. Lots of repeated dialogues, flashbacks and same interactions. Don't take me wrong, I really hate the forced misunderstandings and last-minute problems to move the story along and this was a lesser evil to me but at the same time, the writers here failed to create some memorable moments to carry the story to the end. The intimate moments didn't hit different anymore, and the romantic scenes didn't have the emotional impact of earlier episodes.Another small downside was that the side characters' stories weren't explored enough. There were interesting couples on the sidelines that could've been given more time, and it felt like a missed chance not to focus on them. Considering the above-mentioned issue (writers not knowing what to do with the main lead), I expected more from these secondary couples but we didn't get to see much there.But all in all, I must admit, even with these personal nitpicks, I still believe this will make any kdrama fan happy, especially if you're looking for a feel-good series you'll be satisfied as the overall experience is fun and uplifting.",neutral,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

tt8242904,"Started good, but then (as korean soaps often do) got really boring. Not really a story anymore, more of a 'smirk' there and a cringy encounter after that. The cast besides the main protagonists saved a lot of scenes in my opinion. And the cringy touching and kissing scenes that would not stop repeating themselves were annoying. The plot was ok until halt of the 16 episodes. After that it just did not exist anymore and the whole reason for descisions made in the beginning of the show were deleted and unexplained. Well, that's that, you can easily skip a lot of episodes without missing anything.",negative,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

tt8242904,"This romantic comedy drama was a refreshing change to most K-dramas. It had a great story-line, loads of witty humour, lovable characters and a dramatic and emotional twist to the story.
What I loved most was how Young Joon's character did develop but he managed to remain his usual pompous self but it was never serious and he was actually really kind a caring underneath. In the same way, Mi So just accepted him being so full of himself, not feeling the need to set him down because she knew he was really lovely and kind.
The other thing I liked was the lack of misunderstandings and wasted opportunities so prevalent in many of these dramas. I loved the part where she says, I want to make things clear, so there are no misunderstandings and the scene in the cupboard, where he maturely doesn't take offence, but rather doesn't want to argue with her unnecessarily.
The only thing I didn't like, was the ridiculously annoying woman Se Ra. I assume it's a Korean thing, but the stupid side characters are so unnecessary and really annoying. The actual humour was so good throughout, no silly side characters are needed.
This series had more passion than most K-dramas but still very decent which I really like. Great acting and characters I will miss.",positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

Not to say she's not drop dead gorgeous, it's just like there's nothing there. Must have been tough for PSJ to act around her; she really gave him nothing to work with.Maybe her depiction is a culture thing, maybe bad direction. Or maybe it's her. Haven't seen her in anything else so I can't tell.There was lots of filler toward the end, with a nugget or two of fun surprises making their way through but the series really ends after episode 12.This one gets props for well-developed secondary character stories, for the dramatic sub-plot and for PSJ, who's always spot-on.",negative,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

But this is the first Kdrama in which there were actually 4 leads and that made the series completely up to the mark.The beginning was itself fabulous as you remain excited from the first episode that what will happen next. The time the main lead role spend with each other was also outstanding. Though sometimes I felt that the main female lead is not showing love to the main lead even if there was nothing to be worried about between them. It has comedy,Mystery and Romance which makes you to watch it until the end. I also enjoyed a lot this series, laughing,felling romance and even crying sometimes. This series has all episodes unique. I didn't fell that is was being dragged. It is completely perfect so I would rate it 9 star. 1 star less just because of a few feelings of the female lead.

tt8242904,"If it wasn't for my friend's deal of treating me to a free dinner for watching this show, I would have stopped at the early episodes.I get why some girls like the show, well for starters, they found the guy (vice chairman) cute. The whole ambience of the show is light and funny but along the way, I kept feeling that something is just off about it. Usually with rom-com movies, you expect a nice plot where you get to witness how both characters fall in love with each other (in a cute way) but this one seemed forced. The leading man was introduced as a narcissist and in real life, its honestly damn hard to fall in love with one, not to mention, he, being your boss. Another thing that I dont like about the love story is that the leading lady, as the secretary, planned resigning so she can finally taste freedom from work and to find herself along the way as she reaches her dreams in life. She has been in the industry for 9 years as his secretary and now being told that she wants to resign prompted him to stop that because of the mere fact that he has this childhood promise of marrying her. Its confusing in the very start and it makes you hate him even more as to why would you attempt to discourage a person youre in love with from living her life and be free. I mean you can always court someone and start love in a better way, rather than keeping them chained with you forever. And if youre gonna reason out that trauma he had in the past, well thats just bull$hiz.Now, talking about the girl, at first I was proud of her for taking a stand and be firm of her decisions in resigning but as the show progressed, it seems as if she is being tolerant of the narcissist to step beyond bounderies like holding her hand or to even kiss her. That first date with the fireworks is not at all romantic because the intention was to make her feel 'hangover' for him. Its all about him and it makes me feel nausious; not to mention his constant boasting and self praise. The writers never gave justice to the love story as the whole thing just progressed to the secretary adapting and falling in love, proly due to pity from the past. Its unrealistic and an insult for strong females out there.What made up for the movie though are the supporting characters of the show and a huge kudos for them for carrying their parts well. Like i said, if it wasnt for that dinner deal, i wouldnt be forcing myself to finish the movie.Anyway thats my two cents, more than actually.",negative,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"
tt8242904,"The writer obviously had an understanding of corporate life to catch the subtle nuances of romance and work in the office. There were parts that were extra funny because if you've ever worked in a large firm you just.got.it. The graphics were excellent! The love devil that appears and he just gets pushed around. Or the sound affects from an eye movement were so excellently done. The friendship between the Vice President and his friend was very well portrayed but with a hidden hierarchy in place. The coworkers were close. And, so many hormones running loose with all the office romances. The soundtrack was beautiful. And, their love scene was very sexy I think for a KDrama. The whole film was very real that's why it gets rated a 10 from me.
Here is a Vice President trying to woo his 9 Years long secretary And she challenges him. Not only that she keeps him work focused while he's Love focused. She is very sharp and just what he needs to make him the best he can be. And, he knows this. His best quality is he Wants to do for her and respects what shE is ready for.

But park min young and park seo joon are perfect for the role. Both funny and charismatic. I hope they will make another kdrama with this kind of romcom series. I also like the supporting cast.

tt8242904,"You have to watch it (or at least the opening titles) to get the tagline. But this is a funny, romantic series about a high level executive falling for his hard-working secretary (whose decided to resign) and desperately trying to keep her from quitting. The executive is often described as ""narcissistic"" but I think that's not really his problem. He has a kind of blinkered self-regard where his belief in his ""perfect brain"" and ""handsome face"" don't keep him from being kind. It just makes him oblivious...to a lot of things. Otherwise, why would someone as competent and intelligent as Secretary Kim even be interested? The odd kidnapping plotline seems to belong in a different series and, if all you're interested in is romantic comedy, you can skip over those episodes with little ill effect.

Park Seo Joon had a small part in Parasite, so I am not the only one who noticed his acting skills and charm. The production quality was great, the secondary characters were funny as well. Loved the ""old school"" male office team leader who spent all day learning the gossip and his solution to everything was to go out and drink. Just LOVED both main actors. They were perfect. Don't know how the female lead walked around in those high-heels, but to each her own. Oh, and by the way, this story is sexy as all get out, just like the early days of Outlander.

tt8242904,"OK, I confess. I had soured on K-drama Romances big time. Over the years I've stupidly watched at least 20 of them hoping against hope that the next one would be better, ""cathartic"" even, but to no avail. (Luckily I had found Japanese TV romances, and they are a lot less ""tame"" and formulaic. ) To be blunt, the K-drama romance factor is generally all smoke and little flame. They rarely include any kisses that last for longer than 5 1/2 seconds in slo-mo. But a friend told me this series might ""evolve"" my keenly critical observations. And it sure did. In ""What's Wrong with Secretary Kim"", increasingly intimate scenes don't immediately fade to black if you know what I'm saying. The lead actress here is pretty, charming and not cloyingly sweet. She's relatable, chic and down-to earth. The male lead is well cast too. He has that oddball style of comedic timing, and with classic handsomeness in spades, his character is believably written as the ultimate Chaebol narcissist. But he's in love with himself in such an over-the-top hilarious way that it's not annoying, Plus he's not a cad, just totally clueless, so you can fall for him from the start, like ""Kim Mi So"" has, but won't admit to herself. I liked how the couple chemistry went from tepid to hot at a believable and not so frustratingly slow pace. This show represents a new improved breed of K-drama Romance series. A lot less with the weird obsession over food, the getting ludicrously drunk with friends and those minor characters who hog the spotlight with ""filler"" trivial antics.

tt8242904,"There's so much to love about this series. The first few episodes are hilarious because of the male lead's, Joon's arrogance. It's so over the top It's almost endearing. I love the way Kim Mi So, just humors his delusions with a smile when he goes overboard with his cocky behavior. The leads, and even the supporting cast had such great chemistry. It is a positive story with a love story that comes full circle with a little trauma thrown in for conflict. After the conflict resolves by episode 13, episodes 14 15 , and 16 is without conflict and focuses on the blossoming love between the leads, Joon and Kim Mi So . In some ways, the lack of conflict hurt the story because there wasn't much for the characters to do except gush over each other. The supporting cast fills the rest of the season with different love stories that develop and resolve quickly. It was so cute and that more than makes up for the lack of conflict in the last 3 episodes.I do like that there is some intimacy shown between the characters in a realistic way that was not graphic or displayed too much. It was just right. It's supposed to be a sweet romance so it all feels appropriate.The supporting cast, especially the kids, were fantastic. The kids were super adorable and I just wanted to give them a big hug. Such a great performances. The young child playing a young Kim Mi So , was super adorable, I could not get enough of her adorable little baby face. So cute. Great story, with beautiful imagery and a great happy ending.",positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"
tt8242904,"This drama was just okay. There were a lot of things I didn't like about this show and it was hard for me to finish. This show gets really high reviews and I will never understand why there are lots of other dramas that are worth your time. Most episodes were very boring. Young-joon (leading male)'s narcissism was funny at first but it became annoying very fast and it made him unlikable, Mi-so (leading female) was also unlikable and kind of annoying which is what made it hard to continue. Honestly the side characters like Ji-Ah saved the show, I never would've gotten through it without them. I'm also seeing a lot of people that they had amazing chemistry but I don't feel the chemistry at all.Okay, now the good things. As I said earlier the side characters are what encouraged me to finish the show, I liked that the show also focused on the side couples which a lot of dramas don't really do. And I'll admit I enjoyed the first 3 episodes but it honestly went downhill from there. Park Seo-Joon did a great job with his role, although the character was unlikable he is really an amazing actor, watching this show after Itaewon Class really showed how he can tackle any role. This is the first drama I've watched with Park Min-Young (I've watched Busted though) and I think she also did an amazing job, the actors in this show are amazing.

I totally agree with one other commentator Jasmin_tan about the versatility of a male lead actor. Itaewon Class hero from character to evil boss. I haven't seen any other series he starred in.The downside to the series itself is the soundtrack in places was really disturbing when the same songs were played in different scenes with subtitles (Rakuten Tv) and the rest of the series was really typical of romantic K- drama. It would be nice to see more than just a basic ending..

tt8242904,"Everyone complaining about the last few episodes are wrong. Most of these shows give zero payoff with our couples. We never get to see how they navigate wedding plans, engagements, staff behavior after the ship is outed. Things are usually tied up in a 10 minute bow ending with a proposal.I can agree that there wasn't much drama left after that big kidnapping story was revealed but I was still thrilled watching their love grow and especially watching him adapt his narcissistic ways to her. It's like he created a bubble that now included her too and nobody was gonna mess with his Miso...However, looking back at the sacrifice he made as a child, one could reason that the narcism wasn't only a facade anyway.Bottom line, this is a beautiful love story that I cannot wait to rewatch! The sound effects, the little graphics, the acting, it was all very endearing.The one knock on the entire series was Hwang Bora (Sec Bong).

tt8242904,"This show is a romantic comedy and I was kind of scared the comedy part would be over the top like in many other rom com dramas but thankfully, this show pretty much never turned ridiculous.The plot as well as the characters are very cliché (rich, arrogant CEO and the smart, skillful secretary from a poor family background, both sharing a hurtful past like is the case in most kdramas), yet I couldn't help but binge watch the first 10 or so episodes because it was pretty great to watch an overconfident conglomerate who knows nothing about dating trying to win over his secretary's heart. The supporting characters plus their sideplots made that whole thing even more fun.One of the main couple's obstacle is their hurtful past but that part was solved around episode 10 to 12 and while I appreciated that the writers didn't drag on that story until the end, they didn't do anything to make the remaining four episodes as fun and interesting as the previous ones. Instead, they dragged on the things that the viewer knows are coming anyways since they're talked about forever: proposal, wedding. Oh, and in episode 15 the characters (in different groups) get drunk 3 times. 3 TIMES. So that's basically what episode 15 consisted of: the characters getting drunk. It was kind of unnecessary. Also, the main couple's relationship didn't evolve much after that compared to the first 12 episodes. Yes, proposal and marriage, but the female main character called her boyfriend still vice chairman and never by his true name and used formal language until the very last episode and it bothered me. That's not how a couple who's in love refers to each other and/or talks to each other. All in all, my desire to keep watching the show decreased episode by episode to the point where I kept looking at the time in the final episode - I was kind of disappointed to say the least, specifically because 3/4 of the show were so amazing, entertaining and addicting in a way.Conclusion:
plot and characters are very cliché but still adorable and fun to watch until episode 12. After that, I can't guarantee you won't start to feel bored at some point. But if you asked me if it was worth watching the show, according to 3/4 of the show I'd say yes. But there's no way I'll ever rewatch.",neutral,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

Yes, the set-up for them to work together is incredibly artificial/convenient, but not a huge deal.
Park Seo Joon is lovably pompous as the imperious Vice Chairman, and Park Min Young as the secretary of the title, well...even her pic in the small thumbnail on the VIKI show guide compelled me to explore further..sigh...she's a classic Asian beauty in the same vein as, say, the Chinese actress Li Bing Bing ( who btw is insanely well kept for 45 ), yet PMY has 2 crucial weapons in her physical arsenal: 1 - those cheekbones, & 2- that SMILE ! Combine the 2 + when she also shows her teeth...sigh...Words like GODDESS & ANGEL have been used for her, but they really only scratch the surface of this divine being. And from what I've read about her kindness to fans, the warmth and joy in that smile is totally genuine. Plainly, the Korean Govt needs to designate her a national treasure & a public holiday on her birthday is also justified. And her voice is lovely too.
Oh yes, um, back to the show ! The writing is very good ( the eps with the toy machine and the beach are especially memorable ) , lots of humour and tears of course too, & even the last ep had some small surprises in store. The support cast are great, though Hwang Bo Ra as Chief Bong is irritating early on ( but does improve ) while the lovely Pyo Je Jin as the replacement secretary lights up the screen whenever she's on.
As to the S word, how can KTV be so prudish when KPop is so raunchy ? There's a scene where a a woman enters a room & a man appears in a modest bathrobe having just showered, so she averts her eyes as if there's a tentpole going on ! I laughed out loud. And since these 2 are both presumed virgins & have never dated anyone, the lack of realism in that regard is absurd & will stop Hallyu from reaching viewers around the world who know how boys interract with girls. Another time, an event unfolds which is VERY pivotal for the couple involved, but it's treated as an amusing diversion ! ..sigh...
My advice : tackle these issues please, & it can be easily done with humour and without anything remotely graphic being shown. They're not called the Facts of Life for nothing, yet I recall a simple comment the VC makes to PMY which was actually overtly erotic & quite compelling as a result ! So there's hope.
Alright; you need to watch this show, & I'll conclude, naturally, with the celestial PMY : if I was ever to meet her in person I would obviously die on the spot, but at least I'd die happy....sigh....",positive,"Comedy, Mystery, Romance"

tt22352854,"I am new to the k-drama type shows and I am really enjoying them. The production of this show is very well thought and researched. Setting is great, use of antique cars and all! Really cool! Some people might not realize that they had to teach the actors how to drive these cars because antique cars are not as straight forward as just knowing how to drive standard shift gear. So that was nice to see too. So there was attention to detail.The cast is lovely, great actors all. The story was innovative and fresh, added romance classic K style approach too, with some meet cute encounters and all, and with a few fun comedy relief moments here and there. And the historical point of view post war, was also interesting.I talk about the ending here, but I do not specify anything (but it can be considered a spoiler):
The series was released in two parts. 7 episodes, that were really awesome, and then the 3 last episodes. I think when they lost sight of what they were doing was at the very last bit. They wanted to look too edgy or open up the option to have a second season, which by itself is rare with these type of shows, as they usually limit themselves as type of miniseries. Which has been one of the appeals for me. In any case, in the very last few minutes, after an emotional roller coaster, they tried a different style and then a different path and then another. So the ending was not an ending and it was confusing and kind of weird. And definitely not satisfying at all.I didn't understand the need for it and it would have been better if the would have simply closed the current arc and call it a day.Overall I enjoyed the series but the ending was a big let down. I'll let you judge by yourself.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"
tt22352854,"For now I give it 6 stars, and though I haven't seen all the 7 episodes released so far, I'm not surprised the k-drama fans are out in force as usual to blow smoke up its backside. It's pointless to come here for a balanced review on anything k-drama because everything is ""must see"" and the ""best drama"" of the year, whatever the actual quality.No-one does monsters quite like the Koreans and there's been a glut of shows featuring monsters and zombies in the past few years. Because of this there's some high bars to reach and overcome and there's really nothing here we haven't already seen. There's an uneasy mix of occasional comedy thrown in with the drama which might settle and gel as time goes on but in the early stages comes across as jarring.I'll update this when I've seen the whole series, but right now I'm just here to say that if it really is as marvellous as all the 10 star reviews, I'll happily eat my hat. Until then I'm reserving judgement, despite being an admirer of the two leads. That's not enough for this to be an automatic masterpiece.",negative,"Action, Drama, History"

However the making has I think, many flaws such as lack of detail in some characters especially like that of Wi Ha Jun's, protecting the leads with plot armours many times so that we end up thinking that's absurd, no way that's possible or that it could have been shot differently. Expected acting wise,more from both the lead actors in the first episode but I think their acting got better as the story progressed. A show that has been hyped for so long will be obviously critiqued in detail. It's interesting -both the premise and the characters but making could have been way way better.Finished the part2 and I seriously think they could have made this an awesome show if they had invested more into the writing.

So that's one of the things I didn't enjoy that much. Anyway, drama is so good that I watched all 7 episodes in one breath.Immediately after watching I came to give my rating, and I was astonished to see such low ratings.

tt22352854,"A great idea ruined by forced romance and bad writing. You should ignore the 10/10 reviews as they're written by K Drama stans and the actress's fans. I'm not saying it's a problem, but they wont give you an honest review.Positives, one star for each:
Good premise: human experimentation and it's consequences with a scary evolving monster.good setting: WW2 Korea when Japan is losing the war makes for an intriguing set upmonster design: the monster, while poor in CGI, can be compelling as it evolved and grows.That's where the pros end. The rest is honestly downright insulting to viewers as the writer and director treat you like a child.Flat characters: the main characters are extremely dull, especially the female protagonist. She cannot act, albeit for one emotional scene where she cries. I don't blame her - she has two emotions for 8 hours. Stoic or slightly sad. The characters with the most development are the Korean boy turned Japanese soldier, and the old caretaker of the golden house.ZERO chemistry: the two main love interests have no chemistry. And no, having them accidentally fall into an intimate pose isn't good writing.brain dead character decisions: if you dislike poor decisions, you have to skip this show. The Japanese Military are told to be this menacing force, but the way they're depicted make them look like a bunch of idiots and makes you question how Korea was occupied in the first place. You will come across several instances where the military can get rid of their issue but refuse to because of:INSANE plot armour: After episode 3, all sense of tension is gone. Why? Because you will realise all the main characters will never get harmed. The Japanese army aren't a threat, and neither is the monster. The monster can slaughter a room full of soldiers in 5 seconds, but cannot catch our protagonists over 5 minutes. It suddenly loses its abilities with no explanation. The plot armour also comes in the forms of Japanese soldiers not being able to do their job, lucky timings and characters forgetting they're injured. For example, our main protagonist is stabbed in the stomach by thugs and this injury is shown to have an affect on his ability to move (and more importantly, make his love interest care for him). One episode later, that injury is long forgotten, which leads me to:AWFUL continuity: injuries disappear, characters disappear with no explanation, entire firefights happen in corridors and other people in the hospital can't hear it, the police who visit the hospital vanish and the list goes on. One of the MAIN characters, Sachinoto (or something) disappears entirely after his plot line is resolved.I can genuinely go on, but that would mean putting more effort into this review than the writers and script supervisors did on this tv show.It's a shame because the premise is great. It's a shame because the setting is super interesting. They should've stuck to the horror element of the monster and explored it deeper. Instead they show us the full monster quite early and all the tension and fear is gone. Similarly, there is a throwaway line which suggests that the Japanese Army are desperate for men and therefore conscript Korean men. This means most of the army folks killed are Korean and this would've made for a great internal dilemma about soldiers who are just following orders from Japanese commanders. But we don't get any exploration.Similarly, for an occupied city, it seems to be quite well off. We don't get to see the oppression - we're only told of it. Otherwise you're just surrounded by rich characters enjoying great luxuries. Schindlers List and the Pianist are great examples of how to show occupied oppression.If you think you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering if a soldier or monster is in the next corridor of a spooky hospital - you'd be wrong. Our characters can fight hordes of enemy soldiers with guns and avoid the monster blindfolded.And if you're a K drama fan, don't downvote this review just because you like the actress and actors. See the story and writing for what it is, and don't lie about the 10/10 ratings.The characters are forgettable, the plot armour is laughable, and the writing is offensive to anyone who is looking for anything remotely thriller / drama.What a shame, it could've been good.

tt22352854,"I was really looking forward to this drama and I was not disappointed.CGI & Effects, sceneries, sets costumes, etc..in this drama were made with quality.I usually don't enjoy watching these period dramas about war because it is very depressing and heartbreaking to see the capacity of the brutality and cruelty of men (the japanese really caused havoc and irreparable damage to Korea).But in this case and although there's a few very real and powerful scenes where emotions take over, thanks to the supernatural elements of the beasts and the very unique and quirky personality of Park Seo Joon's character and his romantic storyline, the darkness is somehow compensated and it works wonders.It has been a very long time since we watched Park Seo Joon in a drama, and I missed him. I truly enjoy his acting. He has the capability of taking this character ( Jang Tae Sang) and transform, he showed us an infatuated man with all his awkwardness and clumsiness but also a man tired and in agony for what life has put him through, and you can feel all his pain, anger, frustration and then determination to keep fighting to keep surviving hell.Han Soo Hee was fantastic too, I am used to her kicking ass with her roles and this wasn't less. She had great chemistry with Park Seo Joon and the dramatic scenes were very painful to watch. Truly amazing actress.Rest of the cast was remarkable and I cant wait to see the second part of this.

There were some plot holes for sure but nothing too major that impacted my experience watching this.The romance between the main characters was okay but I wasn't expecting HSH's character to die just when they were so close to escaping. It was a tragic ending for the 2 characters that had come to have feelings for each other and they definitely deserved better. I had already accepted HSH's character's death by then so that ending with PSJ's character in the modern world and HSH's character being invaded by that Najin creature just confused the heck out of me.

tt22352854,"I started after seeing the critics reviews. Mostly positive though audience review was poor. Once I began, it felt like this was labeled as a wrong genre ""creature"". This should have been titled Gyeongseong 1945 or something. Because the story is character driven and I must say Park Seo Joon delivered a tremendous performance in this one. Han So Hee and so does the rest of them did their part neatly. Not high-octane was the only reason people thumbed down I guess. But if you are looking for a character driven, heavily colorful, neatly oriented and glimpse of a creature hunting down soldiers and people apart, this is a must-watch. If you want to watch something that would push your adrenaline, I would suggest going somewhere else.The direction may seem off at first but slowly it became poised in a singular tone. The acting of Park Seo Joon keeps the drama alive till the very end. A fresh, new and charismatic look along with the new language from Joseon Era seemed to have met perfectly by the cast. 6.8 doesn't seem to do justice to the series considering the level of effort that was put into it. I would suggest anyone who is looking for a character driven story with minimum thrills to watch the series. If you are looking for only monsters and high-octane thrills, this will be disliked by you and as I can say from the rating, immensely disliked. But critics reviews were mostly positive since they are unbiased and don't have hatred in their heart. And they were also not expecting only monsters in a series. Most critics labelled it as a 'hit' rather than miss. So, watch for yourself.",positive,"Action, Drama, History"

Too much unnecessary dialogue. Action sequences average. Special effects are decent I feel. Plot holes are all over. No logic. It should have been 8 episodes. Last 2 episodes stretched it. Focus shifted to the female lead with dramatic twists. Difficult to take it seriously when Illogical sequences within the hospital kept coming. Many characters were underutilized. And what was the importance of Sachimoto and where did he go? Even the main General conducting experiments became farcical.

There are some sub-plots of survival during of the darkest times in Korea's history so you might have to dig a bit deeper to find some of these underlying messages, but overall, am enjoying it thus far.

Directing and writing also holds up, except from some interesting love-moments between our protagonists being sprinkled in during high risk chases etc. The concept most irritating to me is the balance of power between creature, soldiers and heroes, as the latter seem to have way fewer problems surviving one to one combat against this military killing monster than trained, armed soldiers do.

tt22352854,"I'm astonished at how many 10-star reviews there are. Did anyone even watch the full series? Are you just staring at the actor's pretty faces? Are they just rating the costumes?If you're looking for a story with continuity and plot, you should leave your expectations at the door. The whole story reeks with aggravating decisions made by every single character at every single turn. I don't know where to begin. It's like describing the logic of a dream and the person listening to it just has to nod their head and say ""uh-huh"" because they don't want to be rude. I only finished the series because I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.Tropes of Mad scientists, power-hungry lieutenants with a personal vengeance, and a test-tube monster which slaughters everything in the blink of an eye -- with the exception of the main cast somehow. Every single soldier repeats the mistake of shooting this monster, and even with a full firing squad, the monster is able to kill each and every one of them at once. And yet, whenever the main characters holds a bolt-action rifle at ten meters away, it's staggering to stand straight and runs half as fast.Character wounds are insignificant. Midway through the series Tae-sang, the main character, is slashed with a katana by some thugs. He absolutely needs stiches for this injury, but instead continues throughout the entire series without any attention to how paintfully dehabilitating this wound should be. It's never closed, and he never complains about it. In fact as soon as he first wraps it up, he jauntly swings his jacket over himself. Alright, - so let's pretend his pain tolerance is somehow infinite, but this wound should have opened up over again and over again. He's literally sprinting, climbing, bending, and crawling. He gets shot, stabbed, and beaten, and yet none of this ever impacts his energy or mobility.Characters have no minds. There is a moment when Jang Tae-sang, Comrade Kwon Jun-taek, Yoon Chae-ok, and her father are crawling through a vent and land in a janitor's closet of some sort. Just then a guard catches them and for some reason and they each their own turns fighting this single guard. Why? It's a 4v1, and they're all incredibly skilled fighters in a small space. Why not just take him out at once? What's the issue here? Nearly everyone has a gun or a knife -- and this happened a lot. Whenever a character is off-screen, it's like they just don't exist. You could count the seconds on a stopwatch if you realized how long it took for anything to happen. There comes a moment in this fight when Tae-sang is battling for his life to redirect a pistol away from his head, and then suddenly the shot goes off. Of course, you know what should have happened, but miraculously Tae-sang had overpowered the guard and shot him instead. But why didn't Chae-ok or her father take any time to shoot their gun during the full dramatic 20 seconds of struggling? Or even throw a knife? Did I mention Tae-Jang has an open stab wound wich should be pouring blood - even still? All this does is painfully break the fourth wall and remind you that it's all wound makeup for the rest of the series, because they act like these dramatic bruises just aren't there. Also, why did his comrade friend leave immediately at that exact moment? ""Every man for himself?"" Aren't they best friends, or at least he should feel some ironic comradery? Couldn't he at least help deal with the immenant threat of a sigle soldier while you have the numbers? There was no logic here at all. Of course, this friend gets captured in no time, and is ""tortured"" for information. By ""tortured"", I mean they tie his hands through some prison bars in the exact same room that a ton of children just managed to escape, and then ask him to write everything he knows, after which he just does without a moment's hesitation. He even writes a follow-up chapter on top of what he already wrote just as a thank-you card. (What a useless and spineless character without any redeeming ark.)The military is incompetent beyond belief. The security of the hospital is non-existent. What level of security indicates an actual ""Nobody in, Nobody out."" policy? Because every time they instate another ""Increase the security!"", they repeatedly allow random individuals to just leave the compound, like the little child carrying a rickshaw with more children in it than his famished body should be able to carry. They just let him slide on through. It's 1945, why were there no intercom systems in this entire hospital to direct the army?CGI was painfully apparent in so many scenes. I have sympathy for this criticism because it's not easy to get right. But it was like they just never blended the lighting into some of the scenes. Monster CGI is terribly difficult to begin with, but they made the decision of showing the entire monster quite early, which meant they couldn't go back the mysterious ""psychological horror"" stage. Once you show the face of the monster, you can't take it back.Infinite time for dialogues. This nearly killed me. There is a scene near the end where the main characters are defending a hallway through a barracade. Small soldier boy alerts everyone about where they are (somehow a single gunshot gave that exact location away?) The soldiers sprint towards the wing of the hospital, which must be 30 miles away because it takes them a solid 15 minutes to arrive up the stairs and down a hall. By that time, the characters have built a wonderfully makeshift barracade strong enough to hold back perhaps a a curious child. Meanwhile, we're worried about whether our innocent civilians are going to make it out of the window in time. Yes -- there was time. There was time for them all to escape and climb back in and escape again four times over.At first you see the brave characters prepared to defend with rifles through the barricade, and then suddenly they're sitting with their backs to the barricade when the soliders actually arrive. They choose to just let the squadron of soldiers fire at them through a single mattress and bedframe; finally they defend themselves and in three shots have scared the entire brigade back into the hallway. Then begins this 5 minute dialogue between Jang Tae-sang and Yoon Chae-ok about their emotions. I was waiting for a shout or a bullet to interrupt them. This is the moment you would expect the soldiers to be marching down the hallway, to be hearing soldiers yelling, or to hear this livid lieutenant who wants his personal revenge on this woman.On another note, how does every prisoner get antrhax during the outbreak except for one special woman? It was obvious she was going to survive given her significance in the plot, but she didn't even attempt to cover herself in any way. As far as I could tell, there was no reason she would have been safe beyond astronomical chance.Chae-ok drinks the serum, and never even hints at experiencing symptoms. What? She doesn't even vomit, she doesn't even feel sick. Literally nothing happens. And if everything were to happen according to the same time-frame, then the worm should have travelled to her brain much sooner than it travelled into Myeong-ja in the last moments of the last episode. Did she literally not drink it at all? And why did that one woman prisonner bash her head into the wall after drinking the water? Didn't she get a control serum?Why were the vents used so much in this series? Why did they have to wait until an entire floor of the hospital and a platoon of soliders were slaughtered before just pumping nitrogen into the vents? And why did the air vents have a random trash chute for skeletons? Do they prefer that their air-filtration system intake smells like bones and carcasses? And of course, after falling 50 meters down this chute, Tae-sang is immediately found by the angry vengeful lieutenant. (No, he didn't bring backup - he's just there alone.) The lieutenant points a gun at Tae-sang's head and fires, yet somehow, he miraculously isn't the one shot. This is the third time this trope has been used in the series. > Person points gun at main character > Person fires gun > Main character is not shot, in fact, person with gun is shot. They don't show how this scene happens at all beacuse - you couldn't. There is no type of plot-kinematics that could connect a wounded man, still bleeding from his ever-stabbed gut, and falling 50 meters onto concrete and bones, to somehow overpowering a soldier standing above him, and shooting him.Furthermore, why do the occupant Japanese police care if they rescued other men and women from the prison? It doesn't concern them. This really confused me during the moment the truck escape turned into a chase. They hold up their end of the bargain, and now they want to do WHAT with the prisoners - detain them for... being prisoners? Do you really need to extend your resources on chasing a truck of prisoners after you've already found the woman you were searching for? Couldn't you have also just given the prisoners some police outfits like they gave the truck driver? Until the end, nearly every character insisted on wearing their street clothes and not disguising themselves, even within the hospital. At one point Tae-Sang even hides among a rack of coats but doesn't even consider putting one on. They kill soldiers at the start and don't even bother to take their uniforms either.Above all, what did Tae-sang have to prove by staying in the hospital. It's not even heroic martyrdom. He just thinks he needs someone to keep the Japanese soldiers occupied. Why would that have been necessary when literally everyone has already escaped? If you wanted to distract the soldiers, why not just open the vent and trick them into chasing you through the vents like they clearly were willing to do, because they did.By the end of the series, the series wants to leave one question lingering on your mind - ""Who is the monster."" I had many others.",negative,"Action, Drama, History"
tt22352854,"Great suspense and good storyline with a historical background. The drama has some of my favourite actors in it; Han So-hee from 'My Name', Park Seo-joon who never fails to make me smile hence bringing a bit of lightness to the drama, Kim Hae-sook showing her motherly love and Wi Ha-joon from 'Squid game, Little Women and The Worst of Evil always with an air of quiet confidence that makes him very attractive! Although it all adds to the suspense I personally don't like gore and monster-like creatures but the drama does say 'horror' as part of its genres. I got round that by fast forwarding those parts .... Pretty much like I did for Game Of Thrones which is a universal hit! I'm on Episode 4 and I am still pretty much intrigued enough to keep watching.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"

The two stars of the series through circumstances find themselves on a mission within the facility and discover the awful truth. I enjoyed the monster portrayal, the time period and the acting.

tt22352854,"Wow! This series is so thrilling and well made. Every scene is good.The story has an important message about the atrocities committed by the Japanese in Korea, China etc during and before WW2. It took a K drama to bring this often brushed aside part of history to the minds of the public. Well done. Especially since some Japanese refuse to acknowledge they committed them let alone apologise for them or compensate meaningfully for their crimes against humanity. Unlike the Germans, the public stance of the Japanese government is not as remorseful as it should be. And they do not cover the crimes properly in their history books. So the new generation is generally ignorant of their country's wrong doings in the first half of the 20th century. But this isn't irrelevant today. Look at the ridiculous way the compensation for comfort women and forced labor and Fukushima water release were handled recently.The struggle between the oppressed Koreans and the Japanese occupiers is heart breaking and meticulously shown. Even the creature has an emotional connection I have never seen in any other show about monsters. Unlike zombie movies that are inherently artificial, the horror here is factually and historically based so it feels very believable. The resistance and medical experiments are brilliantly blended into a fusion of horror, fact based WW2 atrocities, convincing romance and thrilling escape adventure. The escape parts are as knuckle biting as the best WW2 movies recalling the Great Escape, Escape from Sorbibor and Anthropoid.There hasn't been an A list lead couple pairing like this since Crash Landing. The roles are tailor made for Han So Hee, the most convincing and versatile actress of her generation. Her action sequences are flawless. Park Seo Joon's charm is used perfectly. They have such rapport on screen. The romantic parts are cleverly blended in amongst the action. Terrific supporting cast including familiar faces like Wi Ha Joon and Kim Hae Sook.Can't believe some people fuss about the soundtrack. Who even notices the songs at the end of an episode when so much is going on? There is some ridiculous campaign to attack this show. But the numbers speak for themselves. Top show on Netflix globally.The most exciting and meaningful series in a long while.",positive,"Action, Drama, History"
tt22352854,"Gyeongseong Creature attempts and largely succeeds in merging a missing person drama, a romance, a horror story, with a dash of martial arts all with a strong theme of occupation and possession. The story is clearly about the brutality of the Japanese occupation of Korea. It also uses the creature as a metaphor. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but the creature is the product of the brutality of the occupation. As such it is clearly set up to be an a purveyor of vengeful justice. I haven't got to the end yet, so we'll see how that pans out.Prompted by another review here, I did go and do a bit of reading on the Japanese occupation and Japan's human experimentation program. I never knew. The really horrifying thing about Gyeongseong Creature is that it is disturbingly close to what actually happened. The creature is a fantasy of course and one that appears to be destined to be a monstrous saviour of the Korean people. To borrow from Jewish folklore, it is a Golem - a monster manufactured to protect an oppressed people. Only in this case it is manufactured by mistake by the oppressors.If I'm right, or half right, then the criticism I would have is that there's not enough separation between the portrayal of things that did happen in some form, from the monster doing fantastical and monstrous things. The whole thing feels fantastical, not just the monster bits, and it's perhaps a little too easy to watch as a just a fun monster movie and tale of daring do. It would be better if it managed to do what Pan's Labyrinth did. Pan's Labyrinth is a fantasy yes, but it simultaneously doesn't shy away from showing the very real horrors on the Spanish Civil war. As I say, I haven't seen it to the end yet so maybe my criticism will be answered.In the end I think Gyeongseong Creature doesn't quite make the serious point it's trying to. I'm sure the Korean audience will get it but will the international audience?That said, it is entertaining, a great watch and looks amazing.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"
tt22352854,"Please watch this. The plot is very well written - you will not be able to keep your eyes off the screen. I watched all 7 episodes in one seating. The main characters, Han So-hee and Park Seo-jun, didn't disappoint. All other characters were only complimenting the show. This drama depicts medical experiments done on humans during the Japanese colonization of Korea. It has the CGI added, however, this is based on what really happened in the past. It's cruel and violent, but it's the fact and truth which cannot be denied and needs to be known and learned by all people. You will not regret watching this.",positive,"Action, Drama, History"
tt22352854,"Unlike several big-budget Korean series that have appeared in the wake of Squid Game, Gyeongseong Creature is admirably restrained in its narrative ambitions and never uses it's full potential.A historical drama infused with monsters and sci-fi stuff is brought down to some extent by poor quality CGI and ineffective chemistry between the leads. The pacing could have been better. The drama has some noticeable issues but it is still effective to please us, atleast to some extent.Director Dong-yoon makes sure that while all the characters have their own little arc, it is Gyeongseong- the region that becomes a very important character in the narrative. The K-drama isn't without its flaws. Every now and then, there are a few gaps in logic or parts of the plot that could have been explained better along with s better chemistry. But these are little things in the face of a drama that has used its solid production value to offer something out of the box, although it doesn't stand out completely.My Rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"

The cast delivers a mostly strong performance, however, there is a noticeable lack of chemistry between Park Seo-joon's and Han So-hee's characters. This could have been improved with a better build up before the romance was introduced. Instead the story tried to push an immediate love that de-valued the arc of both characters. Also, the beginning two episodes were a bit slow, but the series is still worth watching.

tt22352854,"Wow, wow, and again, WOW! This series is amazing! Am only half-way, but am really enjoying what I'm getting served. The actors are great, the sets are great, the story is awesome, and yeah, sometimes there's a low-poly 3D model that seems to sit in the set somewhere with hardly any texture on it, but hey, hardly anyone would notice this. Many shots are just so well made, cinematographically, that it makes you wonder why Hollycrap can't do this anymore. The series to me seems a blend of ""Stranger Things"" meets ""Elfen Lied"" meets art-deco. Anyways, two thumbs up here, as I'm also learning something about the relation between Korea and Japan, that honestly, being originally from Europe, I knew nothing about, but made me poke my nose in the history books.

After watching all of them breathlessly in a day, I understood that what I was looking for was more than romance which I had it in this drama. It's definitely not an ordinary K-Drama. It is obviously directed and played with an amazing talent. I cried the most at the scene of mother and daughter meeting and I am amazed with So-Hee's extraordinary talent.

There is plot armour and then there is Asian plot armour, thrice as thick... Each one of them should have been dead about 5 times. The soldiers were all incredibly incompetent, felt like Storm troopers from Star Wars. And the monster itself was a killing much...unless it was facing a main character, in which case it was about as competent as the soldiers...Again, quite a few redeeming features, which is why this is not 3/10. The main two characters are cool, the baddies are slightly exciting, some really good supporting characters (love Mrs Nawol), the premise is good, some really good action scenes, scary monster, but if I had to constantly endure long scenes of romance and sadness in the middle of battles and people wasting a minute to discuss trivial matters while running to escape, and had to suspend my disbelief time and time again, I could not enjoy it fully.In some aspects South Korean cinema should better learn from European and American cinema, because it seems they want the crazy over-the-top drama and feelings from Bollywood instead...",negative,"Action, Drama, History"

tt22352854,"8.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2023, South Korean historical, action, suspense, thriller, horror and romance series with 10, 65-73 minute episodes.First I provide a Unique synopsis then review.SynopsisJang Tae-sang (Park seo-joon) runs a very successful Korean business in Japanese occupied Gyeongseong (later renamed Seoul) occupation. He is determined to survive in an environment that is hostile to Koreans by amassing wealth and influence as a form of protection. Known as Master Jang he is perceived as selfish and uncaring if his fellow South Korean's plight when, in reality, he takes great care of all his friends and family like associates. If you need something in the way of information he probably knows a guy or a girl. That all changes when he is blackmailed to locate a woman who went missing. He is skilled at using his connections to broker information but this time his livelihood is at stake. His mission puts him in contact with Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee) who is part of a team who are experts at finding people. During the spring of 1945, lots if people are going missing after visiting, or being taken to, a Japanese run hospital. Seems more than just medicine is being practiced there, people are being used to run experiments with a violent creature.ReviewIt is a great addition to the monster ""movie"" genre. The monster in this is terrifying and seems invincible. It has exciting action scenes, edge of your seat suspense and fingernail biting horror. If you are a fan either leads, they do an excellent job in their roles. It can be hard, emotionally, to watch realizing the Japanese did occupy South Korea and they did perform horrific medical experiments on the Koreans. It is a lens on how occupation forces dehumanize their ""enemy."" The romance is there but it is not what makes the series stand out. It is complex enough I would watch it again to catch things I missed. I would recommend it highly for those wanting great monster, suspense, historical backdrop, and/or action series.SpoilersPrepare for a gore fest. I lost count of how many people the creature killed. I was a little disappointed that the Korean prisoners were killed indiscriminately by the monster when, later, we discovered the creature maintained enough of its original humanity to recognize its daughter.I wonder if they misinterpreted Anthrax because that is what they said they injected the creature with that caused its horrible mutation. Then, the creature emitted bubbles of Anthrax in a ""sleeping"" state but it wasn't characteristic of what we know of Anthrax. This ""Anthrax"" causes acid burns when it hits the skin. It did not seem like Anthrax so I wonder if it was a translation issue.Several people betrayed their friends under torture and I liked they called it out and Tae-sang and others acknowledged it was not the fault of the victim as they temporarily lose their humanity.I feel we never got the full back story of what kind of revenge was being exacted on Chae-ok's mother that she was turned over for medical experimentation. There was mention of betrayal and I suspect it was also jealously on the part of Yukiki Maeda (Soo Hyun) as she mentions their association when they were younger but that situation was only vaguely explained.The ending was mostly up in the air with the main creature still alive, a second creature having just delivered what appears to be an alien baby and Chae-ok now revived from death but infected with the parasite. It is clear there will be another season and I think there is a confirmed 2024 production date. I do not trust Netflix though so prefer a well tied up ending. WhatI love about South Korean shows is they rarely leave cliffhangers. Netflix is all about profit and leaves the endings open so, if the series does well, they can do additional seasons. A lot of Asian drama fans likely find leaving it open like that annoying.#GyeongseongCreature#ParkSeoJoon#HanSoHee#SooHyun.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"

I particularly enjoy their intense 'fight' scenes together; they make a well-matched couple. The recreation of the historical context is commendable, as is the wonderful supporting cast and characters. The portrayal of the evil humans as the true monsters is compelling, and the depiction of ""mad"" scientists is genuinely scary.

But here we have a group of evil scientists and soldiers (a little too much like Unit 731) under them doing insane experiments on the political undesirables of the city, in the basement of the hospital.Into this background we have a host of fascinating characters and sub-plots interweaved.

The human experimentation of all kinds of things. Yes the series shows one of them which is cutting open alive person without anesthetic. Injected with god knows what. I know it shown only South Korean, but in reality there are also Chineses, Caucasians, and many others from various countries (if you read the history). I kept on thinking this is gonna open a lot of old wounds.In any case, I do love the show. I can't wait for the next series to come.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"

I reckon at least two whole episodes worth of material could have been cut from this.Episode after episode seems to have the main characters hiding in broom cupboards and storerooms for hours on end. It almost feels like real time.They make a break and run...into another closet for another whole episode, that or clamber though massive airducts that are that size I'm sure for something much larger then a human...Tedious.

tt22352854,"When I started watching it and I was practically blown away: really good acting, great story, likable main characters, phenomenal settings and atmosphere, and prettz well-made special effects.Surprisingly, the day it was released, when I checked on IMDB, it had only a 6.5 rating... I just wonder why.I have seen some reviewers described it as a drama but I went through the first 7 episodes it turned out to be more of a survival horror series with several seocondary themes. There was definitely a dramatic element but there was also a marked feel-good element to balance it out.Anzway, this series is much more than just a drama; in fact, up to a point, it was many genres flawlessly merged together: it is definitely the old Resident Evil games meeting a mix of a WWII epic drama, with romantic 1940s noir elements thrown into it as well as a hint of Casablanca! All perfectly shaken into unique cocktail of enjoyably explosive entertainment.This is what I thought after watching the first 7 episodes at the end of December 2023. I got mixed feelings about the last three episodes. They start in a very dynamic way as the plot unfolds but they are also very repetive and the ending is definitely overdone, the plot getting erratic. It went from survival horror with a romance to a farftetched fantasy movie. It felt as if they added nonsensical developments just to have a 1-hour 10th episode.Overall, I still recommend the series. There are a lot of good elements: it is well done, captivating, and it gets better for several episode. The ending though is a little too far-fetched. I adjusted the rating accordingly.",neutral,"Action, Drama, History"
tt22352854,"""Gyeongseong Creature"" falls short of expectations set by the director's previous success in ""It's Okay Not to Be Okay."" The movie's poor script presents protagonists in consistently advantageous yet unbelievable situations, disconnecting viewers from the narrative.Character development is a significant flaw, with poorly developed characters exhibiting conflicting behaviors. This lack of depth leaves the film feeling shallow and fails to engage the audience emotionally.Despite commendable performances by Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee, their chemistry is lacking, further contributing to the overall disappointment. While ""Gyeongseong Creature"" may have its moments, it pales in comparison to the director's previous work, lacking the storytelling finesse and emotional depth that viewers might expect.--

But his idyllic life comes under threat when the mistress of the Japanese chief of police goes missing, unless Jang finds her his business will be seized, Jang links up with a Manchurian woman, Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee) who specialises in finding missing people. Her skills are renowned but her one failure is to find her mother who disappeared ten years ago. To make things even more interesting a Japanese Military Scientific unit is in town and is carrying out biological experiments on prisoners and abducted Koreans. While this story is also about the developing affection between Jang and Yoon the series has a very dark tone, only the vein of (sometimes slap-stick) humour which runs through it leavens the mood a little. Korean citizens are treated with extreme brutality by the Japanese, they are not part of a Co-Prosperity Sphere, they are very much second class citizens, Even the more mundane experiments have horrific effects on the victims. The gradual creation of the main monster unfolds in frightening detail. Much slaughter and bloodletting ensues.

The set production was amazing, the emotions ran a little too high but was as sincere as possible.given the subject matter. And yet, the monster was over the top ridiculous, the music sentimental & trite, the over-head lighting was too much and the plot just went as expected. We were liked the first several presides and was glued to the tv, but towards the end it was just washed out and I didn't really care about the characters except the older woman amd man who worked in the pawnshop: they were great! One could look at rhis show and say there was a lot of hatred towards the Japanese and it's understandable given the horror they wrought but the script did alllow for a few redeeming Japanese.

tt22352854,"Firstly this show is spectacular. Acting, pacing, costumes makeup, writing. I even like how the towns almost its own character too. Seriously I cannot say a bad word against this show.I've been saying this for ages and I'm gonna keep on saying it. If you want consistently well written good made shows and films just go Korean.Netflix has a lot of bright moments good shows and good films like Extraction 1 and 2, The Highwaymen, The Tiger King and Making a Murderer and tons of shows and films I'm missing oh yeah Dalhmer was fantastic too.But then unfortunately one thing we don't get with Netflix is consistency we get an amazing show in Narcos easily a 10/10 from me. Engrossing, engaging the type of show where ur like one more episode and then relaize your gonna have 4 hours of sleep for work. But then whereas you get the amazing show that is Narcos then you have the same creators make Griselsda like really you make Narcos gritty, hard hitting, vicious and clever in its writing and then you have one of the worst gangsters/crime Lords in history seriously in real life this women out some of the men to shame. Why not go the Narcos route and give us a true account of just how vicious and evil this women truly was na we'll just gloss all over that and make her into a female icon pftt yea nice one Netflix.Then we have our documentaries and again this is something that Netflix is known for and has some amazing examples like the David Attenborough narrated wildlife docs to some of the true crime docs again excellent and again then we have new dumb docuseries which are literally trying to rewrite history. Alexander the making of a god oh and don't forget the Cleopatra fiasco that actually caused a real diplomatic incident seeing as the Egyptians are quite proud of their heritage and theirb history.What Netflix have against the Egyptians I don't know but again for every 1 or 2 good shows or films we get 3 or 4 that are guff and yes I am fully aware that taste is subjective what I enjoy in a film or show may not be to everyone's taste which is why we have a wide range if films but not documentaries.Documentaries are supposed to be based in fact not someone's opinion. Not how someone feels. But facts and facts do not lie. The irony here is that the dalhmer show actually had more factual references in it than most of these so-called made up documentaries and dalhmer was a tv show.Seriously Netlfix what are you doin? Anyway like I said at the start of this review you consistently want good films and shows go Korean whether its films like train to busan, parasite or the wailing or shows like Kingdom, All of us are dead, this show here all these shows and films are 9's or 10's everything's on point anyway u want consistently good entertainment go Korean or just wait for the next film or show to come out and do what the rest of us do.Come on here check out the user reviews and see if it's good.Anyway enjoy your entertainment however u like it but if enjoy good writing, carefully created characters that you can become invested in the just watch Korean entertainment.Oh and one last thing this show was trully awesome.",positive,"Action, Drama, History"

Americans granted them amnesty for sharing the result of their research, as everyone knows.This movie has a beautiful story about those bitter times.

tt22352854,"Wow, what a stellar cast and high quality production! This is a WWII era horror series set in Korea during the last days of Japanese occupation just before the home island of Japan was bombed into submission. (What Korean and Chinese people suffered at the hands of vicious Japanese occupiers should never be forgotten.)Just as Indiana Jones movies refer to the actual Nazi search for mystical sources of power, this series presents a similar, obscene drive to develop monsters to set loose upon enemies and damn the consequences to the world. The experimentation takes place at a Japanese-run hospital and the results of their trials and errors end up dead and eaten, dead and burned or mutated into ungovernable violent monsters hangry for human brains. The hubris of the Japanese scientists has the unsurprising result of veeeeery splattery mayhem.The cast is excellent, recognizable to fans of kdramas and the leads demonstrate impressive fight confidence. Park Seo-joon has filled out and is a movie star at every turn. His character has the moral flexibility of Rick in Casablanca, with similar panache thanks to the actor's portrayal. Han So hee, a female sleuth for hire, is swashbuckling as a fighter and spy.The story is fairly straightforward with an about-to-retreat Japanese commander extorting Park's character, Jang Tae-sang, to help find his pregnant Korean mistress to take home with his not-so-pleased noble wife (who had the wench spirited off to the hospital unbeknownst to her spouse). In this time of chaos, many of the characters desperately seek loved ones who've gone silent or disappeared.Obviously, this is a polarizing kdrama given the extremes of opinion.As for the adamantly negative, finger-wagging reviews that dismiss other people's enjoyment, understand that the positive reviews are probably not biased, idiotic fans' defending their favs but folks like me who take it for what it is. Meanwhile, the negative reviews are not the result of discerning geniuses uniquely equipped to judge what constitutes worthwhile entertainment nor are the faults these reviews mention unfounded.

tt22352854,"Set against the backdrop of the Japanese occupation of Korea during World War II, ""Gyoeonsong Creature"" had the promise of delivering a gripping narrative intertwined with historical significance. However, the execution fell short, leaving much to be desired.One of the glaring issues with the drama was its lack of realism, particularly concerning the depiction of the biological experiments conducted by the Japanese. Instead of delving deeper into this harrowing aspect of history, the storyline veered towards a formulaic romance plot that felt unnecessary and cliché. The inclusion of a romantic subplot, common in many Korean dramas, detracted from the gravity of the historical context and failed to contribute meaningfully to the overarching narrative.Furthermore, the portrayal of the male lead as an unrealistic superhero detracted from the authenticity of the storyline. Resurrecting characters and rendering them immune to death may have been an attempt to inject excitement, but it ultimately detracted from the emotional depth of the narrative. In a setting where countless lives were lost, the lack of consequence felt jarring and disconnected from reality.The missed opportunity to delve into the atrocities of the past in favor of a superficial romantic storyline left ""Gyoeonsong Creature"" feeling mundane and lacking in substance. A stronger focus on historical accuracy and a more nuanced exploration of the characters' experiences could have elevated the drama to a more impactful level. Overall, ""Gyoeonsong Creature"" failed to live up to its potential, delivering a disappointing viewing experience for those expecting a more profound exploration of history and humanity.",negative,"Action, Drama, History"

tt22352854,"This series has taught me so much. For example:When holding your enemy at gun point, is always a GREAT idea to launch into a lengthy and angsty monologue and bring your gun right next to the enemy's head, so he can easily recover from your previous blows and kick the gun out of your hands. Because who would ever want to shoot a cruel and dangerous enemy on sight? A long monologue is a must. Ideally while also turning you back towards the enemy so you could embrace the person dear to you.The Japanese army is an incompetent gang of thugs who can't shoot or detain anyone. It takes at least 150 Japanese soldiers running in close formations to pursue one Korean hero. Also, these 150 soldiers can never hit a target despite firing at hurricane rates, while every shot made by a Korean hero kills its target.8 Japanese samurais armed with swords can never stop a single unarmed Korean man wearing an expensive suit and leather shoes. Likewise, a tied up Korean woman can successfully and casually fight at least 10 fully armed Japanese soldiers.A mattress provides a perfectly adequate cover against 150 Japanese soldiers shooting at you almost point-blank in a narrow corridor.In the middle of a hot pursuit, the 150 Japanese soldiers or a monster would always be kind enough to pause and wait politely while the Heroes have a romantic chat, or a discussion about their next steps, or a hug.The Japanese occupation was apparently benevolent apart from one or two psychopaths running inhumane hospital experiments. Koreans own rich businesses, attend lavish parties, their cities are clean and full of normal daily life. The well-dressed and perfectly groomed resistance fighters struggle to articulate quite what they are fighting for since things are good!10 minutes is really an hour when the two main characters feel the need to gaze romantically at one another among the mess of a gun fight. In one scene which is supposed to take ""10 mins sharp, not a second more!"" our heroes take their sweet time hugging, chatting, making ropes, moving furniture and so on - While the 150 Japanese soldiers are marching 20 meters down the corridor. And marching. And marching. Only to be suddenly stood in formation in a completely different room. Because who needs continuity?A small shoulder bag of dynamite can turn a massive multistory building with deep dungeons into a fireball, killing hundreds - apart from our heroes of course, who are right next to the explosives.A person can recover from deep sword cuts, being beaten up repeatedly and shot at, dropping from hights, and so on by having a nice nap.When resistance fighters join a stealth operation requiring quiet movement, they begin dancing with swords on rooftops, putting up large posters advertising they're from resistance, leaving the doors open, and so on - all to be discovered as easily as possible.Japanese people either yell or whisper menacingly. They can't talk like normal people. Also, they feel compelled to talk among themselves in Japanese in thick Korean accents, and randomly just in Korean.A monster fight or a shootout kills dozens of other people in seconds, but when it concerns the 5-6 members of our core cast, monsters go into stupor, bullets become blanks, and the time slows down. Why? Because our core cast members are unkillable. We know this from Episode 1: nothing bad will happen to them.So ... love the series. Endlessly learning new things!

Only very loosely but it did, nevertheless.But look past the familiar faces and all you see is American production values. Lots of guns and pyrotechnics. Pathetic attempts to build suspense. Extended fight scenes and extreme closeups of all the blood. Lots of overt emotional displays - decidedly not standard for K-Dramas, and a less-than-subtle hint of a sex scene. Those are obligatory for Netflix productions.And the ever-present, apparent belief that the audience is stupid. The throbbing soundtrack playing in the background to stimulate proper audience response. Unbelievable attacks on logic and sense. Storylines and plot points that are unexplored, unexplained and go nowhere.It insults the memory of those who suffered so terribly during the Japanese occupation. It makes a mockery of the legitimately horrible human experiments, distilling their agony into a badly rendered special effect monster who (surprise, surprise) is painted as the evil killer. It trivializes the actual resistance fighters and their heroic deeds. For those last two points, we might even say this is offensive.PSJ and HSH do a lot of heavy lifting and the supporting cast tried hard to make this work.

tt13759970,"This Korean series is centred on Kim Do-gi, a Seoul taxi driver. He is a former special forces soldier whose mother was murdered several years before; the killer died in prison but our protagonist is still left with a desire for revenge... it turns out that a small group within the taxi company, including its owner, is helping others get revenge on those who wronged them and got insufficient punishment. Over the course of the series they help several people seeking revenge; these include a woman whose 'employers' were treating people like slaves and an internet hosting company that has a bullying culture. Those they 'arrest' are taken to a 'prison' run by female crime boss Baek Sung-mi. Prosecutor Kang Ha-na has noticed the disappearance of several criminals and starts investigating; she soon suspects the involvement of the taxi company but finding evidence isn't easy.I thought this series was really good. The central story was really good; while most viewers will get behind the revenge seeking taxi firm it doesn't shy away from raising questions about the morality of their extrajudicial actions... especially when we see how those they take to their prison are treated. Before each arrest the group investigates the 'accused'; these tend to expose some disturbing practices which make uncomfortable viewing at times. There is a decent amount of action; these scenes are exciting and well-choreographed. While this is by no means a comedy there are some fun amusing moments. The cast is solid; most obviously Lee Je-hoon as Kim Do-gi, Esom as Kang Ha-na and Kim Eui-sung as taxi company boss Jang Sung-chul.

So we have two opposing forces - Kim Do Gi the Deluxe Taxi driver with a mission to right wrongs and the Cop on his tail, Kang Ha Na, (better known as Esom) who represents the voice of reason, the rule of Law, and the ""right"" and ""civilized"" way of doing things.

If you have not seen this yet, and you're not too slow to read subtitles, then you really should try this; you will be hooked!",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt13759970,"This show is just fun, that's the best way for me to describe it.The actors are great, there is the right balance of humour, emotional scenes and action. It's just great. The stories pan about 2 episodes each and are quite varied in subject material. It really makes you feel for the victims and relish in the justice that gets served.Lee Jehoon is awesome , he acts out very serious scenes , great action scenes and also comedic!I can't get the sound track out of my head haha.Season 1 was great and I've just started season 2, so far so good.

Deluxe Taxi Service.There's so much satisfaction in seeing horrible people, who abuse others for their own gain, getting punished. And punished not just by being sent to prison or some meaningless fine, but in an eye for an eye kind of way.It also doesn't get stale, because every 2-3 episodes there's someone new that they are helping, while also having story development that lasts the entire show. It's all very nicely tied in.If you are on the fence on whether to commit to this show or not, just check out the first two episodes which pretty much have a self-contained story and decide form there.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Even though its in Korean thank god for subtitles which made it more exciting as I had to watch every single minute of it. Sometimes programmes can get boring but not this one. If only this was real life. Sometimes revenge is the only option for criminals who think they can get away with torturing people and when it's the opposite they beg for their lives which is what got me hooked to this. The concept of the story is never give up on justice!! Can't wait for season 2 which will be more exciting.

tt13759970,"I enjoyed this series, but to be honest it was quite overrated by its rating, it doesn't deserve an 8+, the plot was ok but the cases were not that interesting, and furthermore the 4 main leads are supposed to be average everyday people with unfortunate incident that took place in the life earlier, who had no prior training; so how are we supposed to believe how meticulous they were in planning and executing revenge plots on behalf of their so called clients on the culprits, and furthermore the way clients ""find"" this so called taxi revenge service was a joke, it doesn't make sense.However if you ha e much time on your hand go watch it, the main lead actor was not bad.If you really want to enjoy a series go watch Mouse, that one deserves an easy 9.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt13759970,"Season 2
This is much better. The story is more complex and intricate. The cases more interesting the antagonists more evil, and the justice more sweet. Feels like a more polished revision of the 1st season. I'm on to 12 , and the Black Sun case setup is very detailed.There's a funny instance where the dollar lawyer showed up. Seem like cross promotion. And so is the chocolate and drink ad placement. Too bad the female lawyer is excluded here.Seaseon1
Ok, I'm on the episode where the taxi team is going after the evil twin brothers. And the prosecutor is finally understanding somethings are outside of the law. But is it revenge or moral values? Think the writer picked the former. Then this is a 6.5 and not a 7 rating.The setup, as the audience, you can see it coming from how relentless the female prosecutor was introduced. Mixed in with all the different cases of miscarrage of justics it had to come to this : she wanted punish the bad guys since the law can't.Probably it will end with the law taking down the evil empire of the female boss to balance both sides of the coin.To be clear I cringe (and fast forwarded) through the reliving of the all the sad parts. And they are milking for your sympathy, really melodramatic stuff here. Because I want to see punishment or the good pleasing counter ending, but not helplessness (or suffering).Don't we all?

tt13759970,"I came upon this by accident after seeing the 'Taxi Driver' title I was almost certain this wasn't a graphic for the Martin Scorsese movie starring Robert De Niro.After reading the Netflix synopsis I thought that sounds great! I'll give it a watch. Unfortunately, in actuality it is a poorly executed almost surreal interpretation of what should have been a highly engrossing series.Its Korean and they have their own cultural inclinations which are very evident here. I'm certain a lot of the plot was misconstrued by cultural unfamiliarity, whilst equally as much was lost in translation by the Netflix subtitles that I imagine are some way off the mark of actual dialogue. Still, the scenes that unfolded were a weird patchwork of over dramatized filler material, odd accompanying music and irrelevant character detail that went nowhere.There is no sharp concise storytelling here. Rather a long yarn of oddly incongruous screenplay that tries the patience as it meanders here there and elsewhere with an apparent focus all of its own. The writing is fairly sloppy and to be fair even though there is talent here as it is done with some intrigue, it isn't good enough to make the experience worthwhile and on the whole the overall production is poor. Half of this need to end up on the editing floor, and the other half needs some serious rework. Its not terrible just... not really ready.Its not all bad however. The essential premise is good and some of the plots are powerful and disturbing, but it's very much amateur hour in the production and you need a will of steel to make it through all the episodes.I'm only surprised by the number of rave reviews. I'm seeing reviews with 8's, 9's and 10's like their giving out sweets and the omnipresent stream of negativity that is continually prevalent on almost any release large and small screen, is oddly absent here.The series is in an odd no-mans-land between Black Mirror and The Equalizer, it's intriguing but weird, and though I can certainly see the appeal there is no masking the flaws shortcomings in quality. I think after the first episode you will will be fairly certain if its for you or not, but sadly its not for me and I can't in all honesty recommend it, though I would recommend you see at least the first epsiode as a gauge on your tastes.The best I can do on score here is 4.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Everyone's acting was very convincing as well, I felt complete hatred for the bad guys. The good guys were all very likable, although at times the female prosecutor came off as overbearing.Of course it isn't realistic, some things left me smiling and thinking if only things worked like that in the real world. The show is very addicting, from the first episode it grabs your attention. The cases/ crimes involved were very interesting to me, and the action was great!

Running through the series is an upright public prosecutor who suspects their involvement in crimes and abductions and wants to bring them to justice. The stories are interesting but like many of this type of series I find the unrelenting darkness of the criminals who become more evil in every new episode too depressing.

Not so much the others who all lacked the range to transcend the mediocre script with which they'd been dealt. To add to that, the plot sequencing and editing were horrendous; admittedly, I don't know much about filmmaking but I do know what works for me as a viewer and this show is a mess. Cut the episodes in half, remove the fillers, and maybe we'll get something half way decent. As it is, I fast forward through the scenes that don't involve Je-Hoon's character bcos life is too short to stay watching paint dry.Ps: With her bland performance in this series, it's hard to believe Esom is an award-winning actor.

tt13759970,"Taxi Driver is a South Korean television-series adapted from the webtoon 'The Deluxe Taxi' (Red Cage) written by Carlos and Lee Jae-in, and based on actual heinous crimes committed in South Korea. Lee Je-hoon dons the bomber jacket and fingerless driving gloves as former special forces officer-turned-taxi driver, Kim Do Ki. Working for a mysterious company under the guise of the ""Rainbow Taxi"" alongside CEO Jang Sung-chul (Kim Eui Sung), computer hacker Ahn Go-eun (Pyo Ye-jin), lead mechanic Choi Kyung-goo

of injustice. They set out to reform society with their
own means of retribution for the oppressed.As one of my highly anticipated K-dramas of 2021. I can proudly express that my expectations were met and I believe it was due to the convincing performances from the lead cast members. Particularly Lee Je-hoon who once again proves his versatility as an actor, tackling multiple identities in order to infiltrate the territories of his enemies. Pyo Ye-jin who served as a replacement for Lee Na-eun following ostracism accusations delivered an emotionally driven portrayal as the damaged Ahn Go-eun which turned out to be the most noteworthy for me. Her casting was simply a phenomenal choice and she even showcased her singing talent on one of the tracks for the series titled ""A Walk"" which molded a somber atmosphere. As opposed to ""Rainbow Corporation"" and ""Model Taxi"" composed by Kim Sung Youl with electronic beats and synthesizers that immerses the viewer into a modernized eighties era. Reminiscent to one of my favorite films of all time,
'Drive.' Furthermore, the fight sequences and
the camera work behind the wheel will certainly please fans of the action genre. This series has much to offer audiences and I would not miss out on this groovy season.IG: thecinephilereviews.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt13759970,"""Taxi Driver"" is a gripping and thrilling Korean television series that takes the viewers on an emotional rollercoaster ride. The show has an excellent plot that focuses on restorative justice and revenge.The series follows a group of vigilantes who seek justice for the victims of heinous crimes that go unpunished. The show tackles themes like corruption, power dynamics, and the flaws of the justice system. The vigilantes operate under the guise of a taxi service, providing rides to the victims of injustice and carrying out their revenge. The concept is unique and engaging, and the show does an excellent job of building suspense and anticipation.The plot is not only exciting but also thought-provoking. It raises important questions about justice and morality and whether vigilantism is an acceptable solution. The show highlights the flaws in the justice system and how the police are not always capable of providing justice to the victims. This is where the private investigators come in and provide an alternative solution to the problems. The dynamic between the police and the vigilantes adds a layer of complexity to the plot and keeps the audience engaged throughout the series.Although set in the present, the show has a retro vibe that adds to the overall charm and the sound track is also worth mentioning. The music is a perfect match for the show's themes and complements the action and suspense and it matchs the 1980s vibe.The only drawback of ""Taxi Driver"" is that some of the characters are sometimes exaggerated, which can be a bit off-putting at times. Kim Do-gi is a beast in fighting, Go-eun overreacts in crying and her trauma. However, this does not detract from the overall quality of the show, and it is still definitively worth watching.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

-Great acting, especially from Lee Jehoon

tt13759970,Even though i never read the subs as i cant understand korean language. I have a very good understanding of what the episodes are about. They are very well produced and written and the acting is superb. My only issue is why netflix uk blurs silly things while the series is blatenly an 18+ and most of the fight scenes can be noticed with slight trimmings. Also i have an issue with knife users on the show. Like why is there a need to blur that out when its like normal here in the UK most days in our daily lifes. If we can have a gun then a kitchen knifes is normal here. But in a series like this they blur it for silly reasons. Even silly logos on a outfit and many more. Netflix is weird. I wonder if the subtitles are also wrong compared to what they're really saying in korean. Great show just ruined by petty censorship...,positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"
tt13759970,"Much like in the middle-ages, seeing a criminal at the pillory seems to be utterly satisfying.By playing into the antiquated and poisonous idea that the justice system fails victims by not being harsh enough on criminals, it lets one feel legitimate in enjoying the torture or murder of anyone branded as a bad guy. Manichean, simple-minded, openly pro-revenge, I was not able to go past the first episode.After Kim Hye-su (Juvenile Justice), Lee Jehoon is the second actor of the excellent Signal to endorse a role in a series with questionable morals, making me wary that actors don't really care much about that aspect of their job.",negative,"Action, Crime, Drama"

tt13759970,"I've just started watching this, aww so far it is harsh. But then it gets exciting as things go the way of the Taxi Driver.This series really gets you brain ticking over as the various criminal elements appear and the ""Rainbow Taxi Service"" works to address the injustices of the Korean Law System. It is certainly bitter, disturbing ad ofttimes violent but the viewer (me) I'm keen to see how they solve, focus on and resolve these issues.I find it compelling, entertaining and thought-provoking the manner which they come to their solutions. It is a gripping and riveting portrayal of the underbelly of crime and the mentality of criminals.The Taxi Driver has a weakness that make him pass out when he sees things that remind him of his mothers death.Episode 12 is heart wrenching and the unbelievable happened. The Ha Na is a prosecutor who investigates Rainbow Taxi. She is furious with their lawless behavior, but then when her side kick and supporter is killed she get to feel how all the victims of vicious crimes feel. She is heart broken, helpless, grief-stricken, anguished and hopeless. Before this she had no real reality of the pain of the victims. She just wanted the law to be fulfilled. She gets to realise the reasons that the victims seek revenge.Then prison supervisor of the Rainbow Taxi Prison, turns on them because she know that she and her cronies will be the next ones to go down. She is totally evil and set up and planned the whole thing. The criminals freed seek to get their revenge on the Rainbow Taxi's.This drama surely builds and builds up so the every episode peaks and then rebuilds up even more suspense as every new episode unfolds to even higher and even more dramatic climax.With revenge there is no turning the other cheek. There is no iota of sympathy for the wrong doer.This drama is not for the faint-hearted. It covers serial murders, rape, organ trafficking with close views, using acid to get rid of bodies and excessive violence.""Don't succumb to evil but overcome it with good."" The motto of the Rainbow Taxi's CEO. Is what they do though actually following this creed? I personally don't think that it was a good ideas to imprison those criminals in his own private jail.It's astonishing but not unbelievable that the most heinous criminals can love someone just as much as ordinary people and will do even more horrendous evil to keep the one they love alive and beside them. Then they forget the work of karma in our lives. She was betrayed by her own men or did she set it up.....back later with the results. I think she set it up but I can't be sure that she would risk her own life.Wow! As it comes to the ending episodes it become so scary. I have to pause and take a breathe before I can move on.

Also, women in this show wear even more Make-Up than they usually do in Korean shows anyways, making them looks like dolls entirely.Additionally, constant use of music in the background makes it seem like the show thinks it's a sitcom and is eventually making it hard to dive into the story.

tt13759970,"...had best dig two graves.What a great show! Engaging, funny, some really good twists and turns, great action scenes and fight, and in some parts, really grim.I watched with subtitles as I think is the best way to watch. While thing maybe don't translate 100% I deel that get a lot more out of listening to the inflections of a foreign language.Ultimately, it's about the futility of the revenge and how it can be all consuming. While a few choice antagonists do get what is coming to them in a variety of ways, the long-game lesson is well put across.The tail end of Episode 15 was quite shocking, and reflects a case that occured here in New Zealand too.Unlike a lot of American shows there no silly trite romance (because ""reasons""), the characters are multi-dimensional, and music is used to effect instead of punctuating every single moment with grating noise that drowns out dialogue.Oh yeah, there's not a lot of non-Koreans in it either, like almost none, maybe because it is set in Korea. Just sayin'. So if you want ""because diversity"" Netflix has lots of other shows that will fulfill that.Also, the insights into Korean culture are very cool. Like me, in scenes when they sit down to eat you will be thinking ""damn that looks so good"". I want to visit.As this is spoiler free, I won't deep dive into characters and plots.

And of course the same happens withe the rest of the crew. Together they start the journey of punishing evil themselves.This concept is not new of course, we have seen similar things watching Daredevil or the Punisher and somehow it feels great.Well made and super interesting cases.The second season feels a bit bland in comparison, not as much emotion involved and it gets predictable very early. It is way too long because there's essentially nothing new to tell.Maybe there's a 3rd season in the works, which I will watch for sure but i hope it tells a better and more thrilling story, hoping for some romance too!A great series nevertheless.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Drama"

Although I have only watched 1st year there are some scenes that are too far fetched.Episode 8 where he gets beaten by a baseball bat for several minutes but manages to untie himself and come out swinging to fight a platoon of bad guys and win - WOW. Then there is the unnecessary crying by the female actress on and on and on. OK we get it her issue is unfortunate but get on with it and take revenge.

I won't repeat the synopsis as others have done, suffice to say it is about revenge when criminal/prosecutions cases fail to give adequate justice. Who you call? The deluxe taxi service. A small team who at a price will exact revenge on your behalf.Each of the team has their own back story and reason for enabling revenge. The action scenes are some the best Have seen. With a few comedy scenes thrown in to lighten the stories. Every actor in this series is top notch but as I have said the actor Lee Je Hoon who works underground and becomes various characters as he investigate undercover, is just amazing. Hollywood look and learn!A confusing moment; thought that the ML's mothers killer had died in prison, but the convicted killer was released and then turned out to be the wrong guy. The right guy was very much alive in prison. I will have to go back and watch the earlier episode to see if I misunderstood.There is no distracting love story, just a basic cops and criminals and revenge seekers. Some of the scenes are gory and some very violent but it didn't distract from the deep angst of relatives suffering loss after their loved ones had been murdered. The revenge seeking nonjudicial actions are checked and questioned regularly by the prosecutor's office which I appreciated.I know I will watch it all again albeit much slower, so as not to miss a moment of action.I highly recommend this series.",positive,"Action, Crime, Drama"

They also have some great directors, actors, and actresses as good as any in the English speaking world. This program introduces talented and beautiful actresses in every episode.

tt8750956,"Among the vast and rich human resources, we have one that allows us to learn and improve: the art of storytelling.
Before the times of documentation of history, were the stories about knights, warriors and their exploits that gave us the possibility to believe, grow and create. Entire civilizations were armed according to their needs, the majority based on beliefs, superstitions and myths.
And between reality and legend there is always fantasy extolling every feat. The epic and the glory encouraging us to be brave. Punishment or redemption marking the path to good or evil.
That's what this series is about. Comparable to others because it also represents various epic fantasies. But unique in its class because in the process each story, each villain and each hero possess the original and unique voice of the narrator.

tt8750956,"When you think of a Korean drama, you'd think of a modern love story in which characters are drawn closer in the face of conflict. This production is a daring, and likely expensive, leap into uniqueness that goes far beyond the typical romance. The vibes felt in Avatar, Narnia, and Harry Potter films are also felt throughout the episodes that make this show a cinematic experience you'd never wish would end.
The reviews don't do justice to this beautifully put together show; I had expected at least a 9/10 if not higher.Some critiques argue that the lengthy episodes make the story progression rather slow. However, any great tale that keeps us on our toes are those that invest time to connect with the characters (this may be why original novels tend to be superior to their movie counterparts). Critical comparisons made with Game of Thrones may as well be beyond my understanding; this drama holds its own essence.
Irking our curiosities of primitive life and a plot that pulls on your heartstrings. The actors and entire production crew couldn't have done a better job. This show is more than about romance; its about friendship, commitment, respecting mother nature (yes, like in Avatar), and believing in yourself.

The first episode is kinda convoluted. Viewers were thrown into the midst without any guide or explanation to the background behind the setting of the story. This probably contributed to it's low rating.But as the season goes on, the story line become apparent and it starting to become interesting. The article cited the props and clothing as the indication that Arthdal Chronicles is a copy of GOT. But this like saying that Brooklyn Nine Nine is a copy of Law and Order because they both have guns and Police uniform. Nothing can be further from the truth.Unlike high medieval settings of the GOT, Arthdal Chronicles was set during the early bronze age and the time when human race starting to emerge from a tribal society into an early form of nation state.

I have been recommending this show to anyone and everyone i know and have not done that since the early days of GoT.

Instead of the feeling like these people are only there to do their job.
The CIG is acceptable, this is not a hollywood production so I am impressed with how much they can get out of the budget. And the sets are also done well, and with story and lore behind them too.

If you are familiar with Korean Historical dramas, they are usually set in politically treacherous time in Korean history. The same goes for all East Asian historical dramas. Game of Thrones' political twists, you might say, are merely influenced by historical events. In fact, Martin admitted as much.Arthdal Chronicles is loosely based on Korean mythology regarding the First City called Ah-sa-dal. The names mentioned within the shows are loose derivations of characters in the mythology. This is just a fantacy twist of how Korean Historical dramas usually go.

So they have something in common. And no matter which fantasy show you take, you will probably find some king sitting on a throne and some women in pretty dresses, swords and castles. Game of Thrones was based on the scandinavian Edda, an old myth. A lot of fantasies are based on old myths, its what makes them so interesting - they remind us of fairytales we heard in childhood. And at the same time, if they are great, they are unique. Arthdal Chronicles has created something beautifully different from what we have seen before. It is creative, imaginative, captivating. The series started a little slow, but quickly found its pace. It has great actors, who very clearly do their best to bring their roles alive.

It Really ticks me off to read negative reviews from people who only watched one episode, or can't even get the character names right (talking to you, ""Decider""). I've watched the 12 episodes available so far. The characters evolve, they are not cardboard cutouts that remain static. The beautiful world is progressively both viscerally and intellectually challenging for those characters, and the viewer follows that progression along with the characters. We know more and more as they know more and more; and so the payoff after the first 12 episodes is very satisfying and sets up big anticipation for the remaining six.I'm a big fan of Asian drama (typically C or K), and I know very well most of the tropes about harem or CP schemes, fantasy falls and rebirths, empire desires, and fated love stories...both tired and well-done. This is different and refreshing, and Very well done. I felt very ""dropped in"" to the world of the series.

tt8750956,"Each episode gets better and pulls you further into the world that has been created.I liked first few episodes just, but by episode four I loved it! The depth of character, plot and world building is incredible. Every single actor is an incredible actor but I think it takes to episode four to really appreciate that, as at first there's so many different characters to introduce.It's unusual in any film/tv show, to have every single character regardless of role size to be so skilled and frankly, engagingly brilliant, but even though there are so many roles in this epic production, every single character/actor connects with the audience and gived a real sense of who the characters are in this. So impressive.I've only given 8 stars as the last few episodes I didn't think matched the quality of the others.I think from episode 16-18 it went somewhat downhill and what had seemed really tight structured plot up to there, sort of unravels for me. The production values are still present but the story wasn't as tight and flowing. Episode 18 was really disappointing as did not tie anything up. Didn't even leave it on a tight, suspenseful cliffhanger, it just ended an episode.Increasingly across the board, tv and films have been so shallow depth-wise. I've gotten so fed up of the kind of cr@p being released that I rewatch shows/films that were well made, gotten so used to lazy writing, casting, direction and bad acting that I was not expecting to find a treasure like this.I won't spoil the plot. But anyone looking on here to see if this is worth watching. First few episodes were ok, but from four, it goes up and up in awesomeness, the first three being the foundation. But then after getting through more episodes, the first few are re-evaluated in.hindsight because the reason they're different is because you're seeing literal character life development and world expansion, as they experience more at which point I appreciate the first few with fresh eyes if that makes sense.Those whom wrote this, directed it, acted in it, created the set/cgi, edited, produced, are brilliant. If only others could produce this level of tv/film quality instead of the stale hurty brain deadening rubbish that's generally churned out.This was released, I think, in 2019, and seems to be on hiatus, I hope they do a second season.

I don't really like the way they divided the series into three seasons though, as it didn't make sense and they didn't concluded the first season smoothly.That said, the first episodes presented the whole arthdal universe. However, they should have made a better job with it, as it was not easy to understand it and it takes a while to remember the characters (part of the three main).Overall, the three main characters were the best part of the drama, in addition to the cinematography.

It's challenging to imagine that anyone else could match their brilliance(According to first season). As someone who eagerly awaited the second season due to the excellence of the first, it's disappointing that the new cast doesn't evoke the same emotions and connection. The magic that the original leads brought to the show seems to be missing. It's hard to believe that this change will yield the same results and capture the hearts of the audience in the same way.

tt8750956,A 2 for cinematography.I honestly tried to watch this with the number of 10 reviews. I forced myself to wade through episode 1 which was very painful. I love out there different stuff. However this is just none sense. UNWATCHABLE!Plot make no sense.Acting is way over done.Characters are ridiculousMusic sucks.Theses 10 reviewers must be from another planet..,negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt8750956,"Arthdal Chronicles is truly an epic fantasy saga held in what we may call the bronze age of Korea. Leading actors, especially the king (Jang Dong Gun), are very strong and powerful in portraying their characters. The FL (Kim Ji Won) is very pretty, but her character is very bland from beginning to end. I was hoping for a big change all the way to the end, but not much happened. I was more impressed with the second FL (Kim Ok Bin), who was the perfect ""evil queen"", and yet was true to her love of the king. I am sure her character will be very important in season two. The role of Eunsom, played by Song Joong Ki, was surprisingly, not as interesting as the others. He was quite frustrating as the poor slave for 16 episodes and finally got stronger in the last two episodes. Joong Ki's role as Saya was more interesting, yet it bored me. I loved the actor, Kim Sung Cheol, who played the zany Ipsaeng. He stole most of the scenes he was in. There were a lot of wonderful actors in supporting roles, all familiar veterans, who did a great job. Bravo to all - such hard work in that cold weather!! The storyline was quite good and consistent. This series definitely has a lot of legends, religious superstitions, violence, bloody war scenes, killings, and very little in the romance section. If you are a lover of historical and gritty drama, then Arthdal Chronicles is it. The OST was very, very good throughout. Costumes and make-up were wonderful and the cinematography incredible.Season 2 - the Iron Age - was more interesting to me. (I am amazed that it took four years to air it!) I followed it simply because one of my favorite actors, Lee Joon Gi was starring in it. As expected, his portrayal as the twin brothers was more matured, stronger, emotional, and very distinctive. He is such an intense actor - so perfect as the macho leader Eunsom and the very insecure Saya. Shin Sae Kyeong, played the High Priestess very well. Always elegant and pretty throughout, she held her own by being strong and sometimes cold in bearing. (She often plays such roles; not much expression in her eyes and body language) The King and Queen were even more evil while the wonderful characters surrounding Eunsom showed powerful brotherly love, willpower, and devotion. The war scenes were brutal, and deaths were terrifying! But, that's what this season 2 was all about. Lots of politics. Lots of new problems, betrayals, surprises. Lots of new characters. I was completely hooked and was very satisfied with the storyline. Season 3 coming up?",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt8750956,"I was skeptical when I first heard that some of the main cast would change. But once I heard who the replacement was, I figured I'd give it a chance. And boy am I ever so glad I did. The new 2 leads are killing their roles. This is my first time seeing replacements fill the roles so well. I really mostly just hate the horrible wigs. Everything else is awesome. I am currently on episode 5 and am at the edge of my seat. I value my sleep too much so I will be watching until episode 10 tomorrow. I am glad we finally got a season 2 with awesome results. Obviously if you are not familiar with the replacements, you will feel some type of way about them. But I promise as long as you go in with an open mind, you will be well satisfied.

The Actor playing Tagon is also very impressive as well as the actress who plays Tanya (Seen her before). Over all, apart from some smaller characters most of the cast in the show are doing an amazing job.The story is very interesting and captivating.

tt8750956,"There are episodes I enjoyed that work, which pulled me in, but basically this is a muddled series that gets worse with pt 3 after we waited a month for it. I watched for SJK. He spends more than half the series captured and being given the thankless role of watching other actors take over. Note: most of the excited reviews were posted during the first ""chapter"" when there was still development and action. The series completely falls apart the rest of the episodes and is a talkfest mess in the last unresolved episodes.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

If it doesn't, then this Kdrama would be poor. It had great cinematography, unique story, amazing cast and their acting was superb. I just felt a soundtrack is missing for important parts and the love lines. I think music evokes emotions and make you feel the the story even more. I think it is one of the elements of a successful Kdrama. So, I really hope it has another season, so it will not be a waste.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt8750956,"Love this show! With stunning cinematography and brutally raw storytelling, this innovative fantasy fiction surrounding how a K-centric society and kingdom originated is so addicting. The 4 main leads are such talented actors who bring their respective roles to life. I am currently having withdrawals because there's a 2 month wait till the next episode...oh! so difficult to endure. Reason I removed 1 star is simply because ""Mr. Sunshine"" is still the one to beat so far.I also have to give a shout-out that this is not GOT and did not copy GOT--watch some seriously great Asian drama series shows (that came way before GOT) in the martial arts genre and/or depictions of historical royal courts and you'll see where GOT shared some of its plots and themes. Just because GOT reached a wider audience, human's power struggle, manipulation, back-stabbing, betrayal have been happening since the beginning of recorded history. No one copied anyone.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt8750956,"Finally something different from all recent boring historical dramas... another 10/10 drama from Queen Seon Deok and Six Flying dragon's writers? Let's hope! It's not confusing at all for me... it's so damn easy to understand in reality X'D I don't get why people continues to say ""it's a copy""... what! I mean then all comedy dramas are a copy since it's the same old story boring as hell with two kisses to make happy the viewers.
The same goes to crime dramas that are all the same last days... but nodoby says ""oh it's a copy""
The same then goes to Historical dramas... when there is crossdressing again and again.
No, if something is one of a kind then it's a copy... really? This drama is like GOT (as a big fan of GOT, I can't see something similar except the epic vibes) or Avatar (seriously?) only 'cause there are ""western traits""?
So... what do you think there it was before Korea? Before Joseon, Goryeo, The three Kingdoms (Baekjae, Goryeo and Silla)... well all historical books say about first tracks were recorded in Lower Paleolithic era.
This is also set in a fantasy period... set in a legend.
I love the style of the characters, it's perfect for a period without the influence of other countries, as China. And perfect for a period so ancient. Any country was like that at the beginning of history... wars, achievements, human development... many factors many factors have established the current world.
The only not so good thing is the CGI, not bad but also not great, but honestly...
this is a television product, not a movie, the budget is great but not as high products as GOT (talking about tv series). Beside that the story is amazing, with a lot of potential. Since you doesn't have historical records you can't know what it will happens... you doesn't know who will die, who will win or what it will happens.

""Eunseom's mom said to him to go back to Arthdal"" but I don't see anything about Eunseom going back to Arth and do anything there yet. ""What happen to the Neanthals?""

Imagine how good S2 could have been then - it would have been epic. Hopefully, they get an S3, and then they have the time to tell the story as it deserves to be told.

tt8750956,"Just seemed so disjointed and the main characters seemed like idiots so you cannot feel bad for them. The problem is that whoever did the script just did not know how to keep a good pace, which has not been my experience with Korean shows. Not really give you finality on something and then you find there is something deeper. And the way the three seasons ended was so unfulfilling. There was nothing really that seem to have been concluded at the ending....anti-climax. Whole was just so frustrating.It was interesting because had bronze age weapons and looked like the swords from that period. Of course errors, like a maze with sort of spikes which really did not make sense until well into the period of armor.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

He brings so much dept and emotions to the two brothers who are so different. What an outstanding actor. He definitely was the best choice for the recast.

It's trash!",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt8750956,"The first thing to commend Arthdal Chronicles on is that this is an original story - and despite some typical fantasy elements, it is fairly original and its world is quite rich as well.
To put it out of the way, the series is not a game of thrones ripoff - there are a couple of minor plot points or scenes that may remind it, but that's all. And anyway, if it reminds you of (the first seasons of) GoT, then that's not a bad thing.To specify all that is good with the Arthdal Chronicles: 1. The characters are interesting, there is genuine growth through the story, and with the exception of a couple of characters, there is no white and black morality - most of them are bad, but sort of redeemable, or need to learn to be ruthless. 2. This is supported by really good acting, from both main and secondary cast members - I am not familiar with Korean actors of course, but this a very consistent performance. 3. The mythology of the series has some original and interesting elements, and the social balance between a warrior, a technological and a spiritual / priest cast makes for interesting power play. 4. Though the battle scenes are very good, this is more of a story based on conspiracies and plots (which also tend to make sense from each character's point of view). 5. Great photography, wonderful shooting locations, as well as good costumes and settings given the probably limited (at least for this scale of a production) budget. 6. Some great, truly iconic mullets.There are some flaws too, but none of them are critical: 1. yes, the episodes are needlessly long, but they are never boring (though the use of extensive flashbacks, even of things we saw 10 seconds ago, is rather unnecessary). 2. Some things, like characters constanly voicing their thoughts in voiceover, seem a little soap-opery (soap-operatic?). 3. there is a bit of plot armour for some characters - and a couple of points where I think it made perfect sense (both plot-wise and dramatically) for one of the main characters (and 1-2 of the secondary ones) to have been killed off. 4. Sure, the technological advancements are a bit inconsistent, with only one tribe holding the secret of metalworking and others not even knowing agriculture, but you can forgive more than that in fantasy.All in all, the Arthdal Chronicles is a really gripping and fairly original fantasy that is well worth your time.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

The twist frequently gives me goosebumpsI Love how they develop each character. You're gonna feel empathy even it's the antagonist character because of their strong portrayal of their reasons and relatability.Slow pace series but highly recommended
9,7 for me(0,3 for bad casting for another season)
there's a lot of cast that didn't look same at all even though they play the character well. And this was also for the bad cgi in the beginning of first season.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

That's a pity, because the series is awesome.It is also different to the movies we are used to (in positive way).
It somewhat reminds me of drawing pictures. At the beginning there are some misty shapes, in the end everything is coming together nicely. I also realy liked, that in this series we constanly get to hear what the characters are thinking, not just the words they are saying.

tt8750956,"Can't believe they replace the female lead and male lead and expect the same results. I was waiting for the second season because the first season ending demanded it. How can you not have actors under contract for additional seasons knowing a a second season was going to happen. That's a standard contract for a series in the acting industry. The new leads are ok, but it doesn't have the same feeling without them. I don't think I have ever seen a popular show has 2 leads taken out of a show and come back with replacement actors using the character names. The 2 season two episodes released so far are more of a disappointment. It's not a continuation from the last season episode. So it has created a lot of holes that don't seem to add up. They could fill the holes by end of season two, but doesn't fix the acting situation.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt8750956,"This combines many of the strengths of Korean TV: deft plotting, fine acting, high production values and great cinematography.

Subsequent episodes will clarify.Sit back and enjoy it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

It's is the living proof that good acting, good script writing and smart plot twists will beat special effects at any time of the day(hear that HBO?... Guess not...)Like with all good shows, though, you need to be patient because the plot builds over time. Well, what can I say, all good plots build up over time. :)Also, this is most definitely NOT a K-Drama. So if you don't like K-Dramas, rest assured, this is not it. In my initial review I compared it with Game of Thrones (apparently I wasn't the only one). And yes, I suppose you can compare it with GoT because there are many similarities, although the context is very different.From a qualitative point of view, I'd put it on par with Seasons 2-5 of GoT and way ABOVE Seasons 6-8. But don't get me wrong, this is not a copy of GoT because it's very, very DIFFERENT.Anyway, personally, I started watching the show because Joong-Ki Song and most especially Ji-won Kim are in the cast.Can't believe Joong-Ki Song. Seriously man, this guy made me love him and hate him at the same time (given that he has a double role).Also, Ok-bin Kim does an absolutely fantastic job.

The thing is its pretty complex and need to connect with the character again and work out their place in this drama.My Review: Arthdal Chronicles (2019)New drama just appeared on Netflix not fully filmed yet but seems interesting so I want to watch it. Some cast members that I have seen before. Nice waterfall and scenery but snake is scary for us viewers who see snakes as venomous and dangerous. We don't have any snakes in our country. The mother has a fever and she is dreaming as the snake is crawling over her. Scary snake picture over the baby but the baby has beautiful violet eyes. Never know in these Asian movies what the appearance of snakes mean.They the people look fierce like Maori warriors but have more advanced weaponry. Their faces have Maori scroll patterns on them and their skin is dark or darkened. They have hidden assailants that are tearing their bodies apart.Sounds like colonisation the eradication of the native races. They're not human beings they are just beasts. Kill them all.The blooded ones with blue lips - Neanthals - Raknkuv - Ragaz - Wear the skulls of the tiger
Igutu are half cast children who have the blood of both tribes. Their blood is purple mixed with the red and the blue/They wanted the the natives land when they didn't get it so they killed them.

Why did he save the baby. He's a Igutu like himself. He has got a name now Saya. He's 20 years old now same age as Eunseom and Tanya. Is he Eunseom twin? He is the son of Asa Hon and Ragaz. We now know that Saya is definitely Eunseom twin.As Ha-rim
Arthdal's medicine man. Born in the White Mountain Tribe, he is Arthdal's premier medicine man. Other than his technical skills in surgery, he can also recognize any medicinal herb at one glance. His outstanding medical skills contributed to bring Ta-gon's strategy to reality. If there was no Ha-rim, Arthdal would not have won the Great War against the Neanthal. He carries with him the burden of guilt, knowing that numerous Neanthal died in the Great War, and that Asa Hon who did not know of the conspiracy, has since gone missing, with no one knowing whether she's dead or aliveSo they wiped out the Neanthals with disease then sent fire arrows to burn them. They oppressors were immune to the disease.Asa Hon Nuriha was the woman they sent with the gifts. She didn't know that was the plan she wanted to save the children and had two babies. They hunted them down but the Neanthals were very strong those that were left killed many of the oppressors. They Neanthals hid well and took them out one by one.

Asa Hon Nuriha give me the baby. No I can't the baby is ill. It was born on the day the azure comet was seen. It will bring calamity on the world. Hand me the baby. I refuse. I will take his brother instead. No don't these children didn't do anything wrong. I will take his father. Asa Hon you made this choice. Asa Hon if the day we meet again I will nor spare your life. You should run away from me if you wish to live. Run far away. Please! Do not pursue the one who sings(Tagon). She wakes from her dream. Is the snake there? Was that the snake in her dream? She has got three children a boy and girl and a baby. The Baby is Eunsome, Girl and Boy left her with the baby. It was her baby. Father is Ragaz. Ragaz is fighting Saram.

but their story line's are totally different.. the producer's may have spent so much for this one look so realistic and spectacular...All the acting staff and the director is doing a great job..
If someone ask me to choose between the Arthdal chronicles and GOT, i prefer Arthdal chronicles..

I watched the first episode patiently and figured the mess that presented itself could be limited to the first episode, as the writer and director attempted to establish the premise of the show. Then I watched the first 15 minutes of the second episode and figured it's not going to get any better. Actors forced to act like primitive people is cringe worthy. It is definitely not worth my time.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt8750956,"It is the first korean tv series I have ever watched and it was the fantasy theme that intrigued me into checking it. It is one of the few times I like so many characters and find it hard to pick a side to support. The actors portray their roles great. The themes of so old times, tribes, beliefs in gods and curses/miracles makes it unique and a great story to tell. Might be confusing a bit when it comes to the foundation of its world-built but perhaps they will share more information as it goes on. It's so nice that it doesnt even have to bother you.
Don't bother comparing or listening to those that compare it with Game of Thrones etc because it's not like it (all shows have similarities) and it doesnt have to be. It has unique plotline and storylines (Neanthals are the best part possibly) and the themes it revolves around are awesome and unique. Plus, personally, I like the fact that it doesnt use nudity or sexual stuff to boost its story and likeness (I adore GoT but still..), because the series is a proof that you don't need these to have a great story.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I decided to rate ten stars by episode ten, regardless of what would happen next. What happened next was beyond my expectations.This is, truth be said, a patchwork of déjà vu. And yet, it is so skillfully crafted that it oozes some sort of spell. I couldn't stop watching. The character of Tagon could be one reason. He's mesmerizing, so intense, so powerful, so dark, so clever, so twisted, so vulnerable and moving at the same time, he stands somewhere between Genghis khan and Dracula, but I still want to hug him...
The whole show is staggering. The actors' performances are just brilliant. I cried when I had no obvious reason to! I couldn't see the twists coming. I beg you. Please grant us season 2.I edited my comment to say that although it would be a huge sin to change the cast (we all grew deeply fond of the characters/actors), it would be an even greater sin to cancel season 2 altogether. Else, why not a movie? A veeeeeeeeery long one. Four hour long. Or anything. I promise I won't just watch on Neftlix, I'll buy it, I'll have other people buy it, no matter the price...Ah.

tt8750956,"I went into this series with very little expectations. It seemed like a huge undertaking for a Korean production, and I would have considered it a success if it could at least satisfy my appetite for some good Song Joong-ki. Well, the series delivered in spades.Arthdal Chronicles has the epic vibes of series like Game of Thrones or The Last Kingdom (minus all the sex). It really does feel like something produced in the West rather than in Korea. The series isn't without its critics who call it a GoT imitation but I didn't feel that was the case at all. They've got a similar atmosphere to them because the fictional worlds are so vast, but I didn't find that to be cause for any decrease in enjoyment.The first season is divided into three parts, six episodes each for a total of 18 episodes. The first episode lays down the basic foundation and from the second episode is when we are properly introduced to the main cast of characters. Part 2 is when things start to get REALLY good.The story is engaging, the characters are well-developed, the acting is top-notch, and the stunning visuals allow you to easily becoming immersed in the world. And can we please talk about Song Joong-ki? WOW. Especially if you've only been exposed to his portrayal of Yoo Si-jin in Descendants of the Sun, boy are you in for a treat! Big Boss's charms may be harder to find in Arthdal Chronicles, but this is without a doubt one of SJK's best performances. He is SO. GOOD. I can't even go into detail for fear of spoiling it. Once you get to a certain part of the series, you'll understand what I mean. (Check him out in The Battleship Island too! Good stuff.)I am honestly surprised this series isn't talked about more. It has a wide appeal in both its themes and cinematic presentation. This is a real hidden gem on Netflix. The wait for the second season will be excruciating.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

The story, the cinematography, the acting, the direction, all top shelf. Korean historical fiction, from 1000 years ago.

The first series of 18 episodes brings to life the characters of the story story as ancient as time itself, love, deception, bravery and betrayal, the fight for life itself.Arthdal has been compared to GoT, this comparison can be seen as both are epic stories, with strong characters and tales of life, otherwise they are nothing alike.If you have never watched a Kdrama or Chinese historical drama before, I recommend you watch Arthdal Chronicles.

tt8750956,I loved season 1 so much and was worried that the new Sword of Aramun wouldn't live up to my expectations but I was mistaken. Lee Joon Gi and Shin Sae Keang were portraying their roles perfectly. Especially Lee Joon Gi who acts finely & portrays two different characters as wonderfully as Song Joong gi did. Jang dong gun & Kim Ok Bin were also excellent like how theg were in season 1. Overall I'm very happy with both seasons & looking forward to the upcoming episodes of Sword of Aramun.

tt8750956,"The first time knowing this drama will be aired, I was pounding because I was kind of a new fan of Song Jong Ki, because he was newly married to one of my long-time favorite Korean actresses, Song Hye Kyo. But sadly, not long after, I heard about their disputes and that they were going to divorce, which broke my heart a lot at that time. This reaction is common among Asian viewers (without the intention of offending a particular race). I was influenced by that issues, in a negative way towards Song Jong Ki, and I heard that time, this issue became also one of the reasons why this drama gained a low rating in Korea, despite Song Jong Ki popularity. The worst thing for me is, that I kept avoiding watching this drama, until just recently (which is 3 days ago) due to my boredom not knowing what to watch again on Netflix (I was running out of options of sageuk K-drama genres).When finally able to push me watching this drama, I then become regretful falling to my past cloudy feeling, which has hindered me from watching a drama with such quality also with so many great actors being involved. This drama certainly offers a different kind of Sageuk story, more likely become Game of Throne but in Korean ways. In this drama, no one seems to be so heroic as each of the roles has its weakness and strength. They pretty much complete each other either in bad or good ways. Also, what attracted my attention most is the unpredictable events. Viewers will always be faced with questions to what extent the stories will go and what happened eventually were all surprising. Quite like a drama with a living plot. This plot makes this drama thrilling and enchanting, apart from other wonderful factors (the scenes, perfect CGI, beautiful wardrobe, exceptional makeup, majestic buildings, etc).But because of its complexity and a quite lengthy pace, probably adding complexity to viewers who are not accustomed to the genre. So probably, that was also caused to its low rating regardless of what it deserves, especially considering the quite big budget spent making this drama. I also assume that this considerably low rating also has pushed cruelly the drama into an unclear (unfinished) ending. But, I heard that there will be a new season, so, if that's true, I'm relieved and looking forward to that.An addition notes to producers and directors: Please, don't forget to bring back more of Neanthals' story also what happens with Kanmareu? Does Eonsum suddenly change to be Inaishingi i/o Aramun? So many questions need to be answered in more seasons, please :) Hoping also to have a more enchanting and growing reverse Saya's stories too. It's kind of boring to watch someone (being inevitably-fostered) with ingenious evil deeds spirit eventually become a truly devilish person (or otherwise, for someone with the good deeds) :D. Saya is both being luckily survived but tragically become a victim due to human-igutu-neanthals conflicts. My sympathy goes for him :) Even though the duality situation also applies to Eunsom, but Eunsom still luckier due to having the opportunity to be raised in a loving environment and integrity.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt8750956,I think this could contend quite well with GOT because the story line is truly and intricately woven. It is not far fetched from the realistic setup of our world.

tt11239552,"I'm really surprised by how divisive this show seems to be - based on the reviews it looks like people either hated it or loved it. I fell into the love it category (obviously). Interesting characters and a revenge plot line were the heart of this show, with a subplot of romance that people also either loved or hated. I understand that people don't want to waste their time on a show they won't like, so I would probably advise ""on-the-fence"" viewers that if you don't like Yi-Seo's character from the get-go (I personally loved her), I feel like you won't like this show (based on the other reviews I feel that her character is the perfect benchmark to determine whether or not to keep watching).A small detail that I really loved and just have to point out was the symbolic use of hairstyles in this show. Also this is hella progressive for a KDrama - I loved how they brought up big issues like racism and trans-phobia. It was refreshing since most KDrama's definitely feel like they can be stuck in that awkward 90's phase of mentioning progressive issues in a way that is funny-offensive (think Friends).Itaewon Class was such a great binge-watch, you can't help but want to know how it all turns out, and it has so many ""yell at the screen moments"" that make it truly enjoyable to watch.

Through episode 11 now and nobody can screw up a great series and a good mood like Korean writers, come on people cruel behavior from your main character isn't how you grow a audience and i see for the first time this last show

tt11239552,"Review By Kamal KItaewon Class was an emotional ride with an especially promising start. Just after the first two episodes, I felt immensely attached to the main character, Park Saeroyi, and was looking forward to following him on his journey. Throughout the 16 episodes, I definitely learned a lot from his hardwork and values. Park Seo Joon did a phenomenal job with his character and left me in absolute awe. Whether it may be understanding the beauty of life or being reminded the importance of hardwork; I was thankful to be able to get to know and learn from Park Saeroyi.However, apart from Park Saeroyi, I did have a few complaints for the other characters. Some characters were especially annoying, and lacked development. I did like that the drama showcased imperfect characters, but it also sometimes excused the ignorant behaviour of these characters - almost making it seem that such behaviour was appropriate to viewers. Some characters were especially inconsistent, and just seemed random. This switch was really annoying to see because it didn't make sense. I think these characters had a lot of potential to really compliment the story, but the writer just changed them randomly in order to make Park Saeroyi look good. I wish the side characters had contributed a little more to the overall plot but unfortunately we were unable to see that as viewers.I was disappointed with the last two episodes as I felt that there were unnecessary additions to the plot. However, the ending was still quite nice and most questions were answered.The OSTs were beautiful, and I know I will play them countless times in the future!Overall, this was definitely a meaningful and enjoyable watch.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"The show starts very strong. Then after 7 or 8 episodes I lost my interest. Why? Story drags on and on. You can skip and skip and still knows what is going on. Cliche and predictable plots. And I kinda expect more story on how the protagonist develops his business (my fault). Turn out they are more focus on his revenge, and the business parts are lost in those skipped years. Lastly, cheesy romance.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Itaewon Class had a wonderful beginning, first two episodes were treat for the audiences. And it held for a pretty long time; until episode 10 it still had it's appeal. After that the plot started to become frustrating, the main character(Park Sae-ro-yi) started to lose his charm, actually no real emotion was portrayed through him. The vengeance concept was never questioned and it started to become stressful to watch.
The romance went the worst way possible. There is really no justification for this. That four years leap made the plot a mess, so, after episode 13 it became just unwatchable.Performance of the artists were great. Kim Da Mi had a powerful character(Jo Yi-seo), which if not likable was very refreshing...but became dull and annoying as the story progressed. Park Seo-joon did great, just like the plot he was wonderful at the beginning, heart rending acting but his character never really got past the revenge arch, was particularly inept in the romance part. And I don't think that's the actor's fault, the plot was very weak. Now, very few reviews appreciated Kwon Nara's(Oh Soo-ah) performance, but I found her amazing. Till episode 13, though the plot really didn't let her flourish, she was outstanding. All those complicated emotions was perfectly expressed by her...there was no way to bypass her and bring the other romantic counter part to be the final love. But that's what happened and ruined the whole tension that was built through the previous episodes. There was more chemistry between her and the main character than Kim Da Mi and him.Ending was really messy, villains lost their charisma, Kim Dong-hee's character(Jang Geun-soo) didn't receive any understandable closure and the final revenge and happy ending was totally shallow and out of the blue, not convincing at all. Kwon Nara's character was totally ignored where she had amazing potential and Park Sae Joon's character was totally lost by the end.But for the first 11 episodes it deserves applause, the views of Itaewon was eye catching at times and the music brilliant.It was that unbelievable wrecking ending which just ruined the amazing show that it could become.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I know a lot of people felt let down after a few episodes. I'm not one of them. I've been watching KD for a year now, non stop, and this show is the one that ousts them all out of my heart (almost all of them).I kept avoiding it because (not proud of this) Park Seo Joon looked unbearably unattractive to me (that was before Hwarang ) and the trailers were poorly chosen. But from the moment I started, there wasn't an episode without me pausing to think, gosh this is good!Yeah, this story has been told many times before. Not usually my taste, by the way. And yet I liked every single bit of it. Every character, every villain, every move, every reaction, let alone, the acting, scenery, pace (except for the last episode: admitedly, that one was dragged out beyond my tolerance).PSJ is incredibly versatile in this role. And he manages to be handsome with that awful haircut. Even Park Bo Gum (cameo) couldn't catch my eye.The love story was boring? Although I thought it impossible, I swear I spent nights thinking of alternative endings were Seoroyi would chose Yi-Seo at some point. Like a fool, I begged with hands and knees for them to end up togheter. Was my wish granted?Of course, there was the whole gay-transgender-black thing, that will make you throw up after watching so many western shows. You'd think they just forgot to add a disabled person. But this is Korea, man! They dare show a black guy, a Korean black guy at that! There were scenes with people touching him, holding his hands, hugging him!! This does not happen in KD land! This is just not done! Racism isn't even considered an issue in Korea because most people don't understand what's wrong with judging people over skin color.In ""Fight For My Way"", same PSJ basically says there is no difference between an island natives and monkeys!I finished this just a few minutes ago, so I'm still experiencing the excitement of the aftermath. Maybe ten stars isn't my final rating. Still. This show is one of the best ever.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I enjoyed this series quite a lot. I don't usually like k-dramas because the romance is extremely slow-burn and the drama is too over the top, like in telenovelas. What's different with this one is that the focus is not on the romance. It has a captivating story that will keep you wanting to see it through to the end.Sadly, some characters are very annoying and the events get a little too ridiculous in some of the last episodes, which almost made me lose interest... but, trust me, it's worth watching till the end just because the main conflict's resolution is very satisfying. It will not disappoint.As for the main cast, Park Sae Ro Yi comes off as strong and inspiring whenever he's in an important scene; the rest of the time, he could be replaced for a wooden plank and we wouldn't notice. Oh Soo Ah's motivations and feelings are confusing and Yi Seo can be really annoying at times. It looked like they tried to make us feel some empathy for Geun Won and I thought he would receive some character depth, but they completely ruin it in the end. All of my praise goes to Yoo Jae-Myung who made a great job as Jang Dae Hee, the main villain; ruthless and dignified but with clear motivations and foreseeable weaknesses. Without him, the series would have probably been a flop.I dropped a couple points because of the problems mentioned above, but the series has just enough jaw-dropping moments to make up for it and make it watchable. Plus, the OST was the best part of it. Ha Hyun Woo's voice is amazing, and his theme ""Diamond/Stone Block"" along with Gaho's ""Start Over"" are definitely going into my playlist. Worth a watch even if you don't like K-drama.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I had to add my review after I read a few awfully negative reviews of #ItaewonClass
I decided to watch this show because I liked PSJ in What is a Wrong With Secretary Kim and I'm thrilled I did!! He was awesome in this series! He is a great actor! I loved the themes on this series, and most of all, the gutsy performance of Kim Da Mi. Her Yi-Seo is epic. She shines!! Finally! A woman who saves the day!!!! This is a great show! Watch it! And don't get distracted by those who think otherwise!!!",positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,The first 2 episodes gave me chills. Beautiful direction with a strong script and cast uptil now.,positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,""" Itaewon Class "" had a strong start but it didn't keep up with the momentum.The main problem with the drama was the pace. The skipping forward years in the future prevented the characters from having any character development and it just didn't help the romance at all. Especially the 14th episode was just bad, as it felt like they were trying to present the current situation of the characters in a fast and furious way, editing scene after scene and just blurting out that the main character now loves this girl, out of the blue, but that's that. No explanation was provided for their actions, no background and those four years in the future seemed like they four empty years (I mean even the flashbacks that the male lead was experiencing were from four years ago or of the same day, like nothing happened in those four years). Another factor that didn't really help with the love story was that the couple didn't have chemistry. They didn't have any solid heart-racing moment either. So, them getting together was just too random and forceful.Finally, the characters remained the same as they were presented at the beginning of the drama. We knew the bad guys were bad and that didn't really change, although, the son did have some potential to demonstrate why he was the monster he turned out to be, a potential that was never really properly explored. The big boss and enemy of the male lead felt also more like a promise of a bad character after all. He sure was mean to the main character and seriously unlikable, but, in the end, his actions were left in the behind the scenes grey area. The main character, in addition, showed zero development. He even got a bit boring after a while and felt a bit too bland in others.Now, for the good part of the drama. The beginning was just perfect. If you like melodrama, like I do, where the main character hits bottom and gets unfairly treated in order to stand up to his own two feet again and take matters into his own hands, then you are going to love the first half of the drama. The revenge plot was very satisfying as well, with a solid ending that was nicely presented. Though, it would have been nice if they showed how they actually managed to succeed, as the first part of the drama had focused on the struggles of them setting off. Another part of the drama that was pretty good was the characters. The members of the crew were unique and the drama didn't shy off from issues like racism and gender identity. So, it was refreshing to see those elements added in the plot. The female leads were delightful too. They were strong women, the one beautiful but a tragic character, and the other young, fearless, reckless and somehow, likable. Sure, she did some questionable things, but she was young and just too full of herself, so it was nice to see how the others helped her realize that her attitude wasn't always right and to grow up. I've also seen some other viewers not really liking her looks. Sure, she isn't the classic beauty, but, for her character, who was cool and interesting, I think she was just perfect. Finally, the OST was solid.So, overall, six out of ten.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,A lot of kdrama...has drama just for the sake of it. This one is different..it real..believable..incredible performance..actors look great...not a lot of fluff. So the best revenge is massive success.Bravo job well done.,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,You have Principle? Please watch this if you believe u are one of the kind. You must echo this drama definitely. The romance line is also charming In this drama but the revenge part is the core. Sadly the ending not good enough and too many flash back to make story longer. The first 9 ep I rate 9 but last 7 drag to 5 only. But the concept of a principle young man just make me feel who will do this in reality... probably none. Interesting to watch at the beginning.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"

to sum up: great start boring end",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"On Netflix, Itaewon Class, was the best K-Drama I have seen from the beginning to the ending. Park Seo-joon is an amazing actor who played the lead Park Sae-ro-yi and no other actor would have been able to portray him as well in my opinion. He is emotionless, stern, unwavering in seeking revenge, determined, smart, defending, a risk taker, a bit of a fool, understanding, caring and loving all in one character. You have to admire him for his good work. The series itself is captivating every single episode. The story and character also addresses a couple of social issues and whether you agree in them or not, it is a wonderful all around series. #ItaewonClass #K-Drama.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,Watched six episodes so far and it is very intense! The acting is top notch by ALL of the actors and actresses. Get on Netflix sit down for a bit and watch some episodes its seriously worth your time!,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Itaewon class is a fresh and modern take on the revenge melodrama that is entertaining from start to finish. For people who have been put off by the serious heavy going revenge melodramas of the past like Money Flower and Shark and Green Rose, it's time to give the genre another chance. This has some feel good moments along the way with the building up of the business and the first take down of the villain. This is an ensemble effort with quite a lot of emphasis on the supporting cast of characters. There is a slight slow down in pace in the last 2 episodes but I understand its is to give some gravity to the climax of the show where he finds the meaning of his life. The kneeling is a bit excessive though.
There are some groundbreaking things in this drama that handled quite tastefully and well without being preachy although the message is strong. Racism and stereotypes are shown with a half Korean half African character. He is quite funny. Also an actress plays a boy who transgenders to a girl. The romance is also unconventional. The original love interest played by Kwon Nara is made to seem unlikeable but in the end pulls through for him and has a consolation prize of Park Bo Gum. This is a breakout role for Kim Da Mi as a fearless smart young woman. I like the way they fell in love after all she did for him. Those looking for a sweet romance with lots of lovey dovey scenes would be disappointed. But they would not have been in place here anyway. After all this is a revenge drama - not a rom com. Some have pointed out a lack of chemistry and it does seem they are more like good friends but this isn't an old fashioned show so it's a different kind of love story. Park Seo Joon does the principled good guy well. Wish they could have varied the silly chestnut haircut at least for some of the show. The villain is well played by Ahn Bo Hyun. Kim Dong Hee is quite good as the younger brother. The OST is good too - not intrusive.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I was really impressed with the acting and pace until the last 2 episodes when I felt it lost its way, I have also preferred a different ending with the love triangle too. Overall worth a watch but I believe a lot of reviewers who gave it 10 wished they had watched the entire series before being so generous.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"The first time I watched this show I didn't reviewed it but this second time around I will.It was one of my first kdramas and I had such an amazing memory of the watch and this time I got to analyze more in depth everything.I completely understand that the script of this series with this magnitude of big picture revenge plot is extremely fantastic in the sense of not realistic in real life but if you put that aside you will enjoy this very very much.If the only objective of a series is to entertain this show will absolutely fulfill your needs. And it will do so magnificently.Even though it takes place in a vast range of years( 15) it won't ever feel slow or dragging and it is just so exciting and filled with events and twists.My favorite part about this show has to be the complexity of its characters. As soon as you meet a character you will start going to a journey of self discovery and development and it's just so fascinating to watch.There's many layers to them and I love the fact that some of them explore the evil nature of humanity and admits and accepts that not everyone is 100% good and you are allowed to be evil if someone deserves it.The one I enjoyed the most was Jo Yo-seo ( Kim Da mi) and has to be one of the most badass female characters of all time.She is just tender and sensitive, but also selfish and cruel and so so passionately fierce and driven.Loved her and hated her and it was just so cool.This series it has all that you need to understand korean values and get to know their culture a bit and it's just so interesting, it also has one of the most satisfying endings you will encounter, I recommend it a lot!!!!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,Da-mi Kim is doing very well. I know her from the Witch. She did a very good performance. I love the way she looks at and smile. That's really cute. I want to see more of her. She is amazing. She is very new in the industry but she is really awesome. Because of her I rate 10/10,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Seems to be a requirement that Korean dramas have to be 16 episodes, which makes some shows meander with drawn out scenes, overuse of slo-mo, too many flashbacks and irrelevant stories lines. This program is a perfect example as it started strongly with an intriguing storyline and featured characters types absent from K-drams (including a transgender as well as an African-Korean). But it goes bonkers by Ep 14 with a poorly constructed time jump. By the 15th episode, It totally goes off the deep end to the point where you literally ask yourself why are you even watching.The love stories seem to lack any chemistry, but the core actors are quite competent. Kim Da-Mi and Lee Joo-Young truly standout.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Even though the characters are very unrealistic and out of this world and pissing you off while watching but the storyline and how the scenes and plots put together still make you addicted ans satisfy, very interesting drama and i like it, unlike any other kdrama, it is new and fun to watch. 10/10. The lead male character's acting is very convincing and impressive.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Few other excellent reviews have commented the same and I am here to reiterate the views.The acting is good but the plot is very weak, there is no character development at all. Throughout the story it feels like the board was set from the beginning for the protagonist's success.We totally skip the part where the Hero did in full control try to commit murder, although punished for it. The story made it out so that it was the villian who put him in prison. Did the villain try to cover up the hit and run, yes he did but he didn't cause the car accident in the first place.I would have loved to see the hero make the choices which actually led him to success rather than just shouting at other to be righteous all the time.I would have loved to see him struggle to wake up and still go to work, handle customers who didn't behave well, actually fire an employee who wasn't able to grow up in the end(because not everyone can actually step up)",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"The first 5 episodes are strong and look very planned, after it i tried to watch it till end because of its great reviews. Very predictable lines and many dull scenes, it usually has 10 seconds dull scene. No chemistry and I cried only at the first and second episode.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Its been a while since I write any review. I am writing a review for this drama just because this is so special drama.To be honest, I was ignoring this drama from last 3-4 months just because I thought this is just an average revenge drama but few days back I decided to give it a try.In the first episode, I realized that this is not just a average drama. It is way better than that. Seriously, This drama is so colorful and cheering.If I talk about all the actors then they all have done a excellent job and direction was also so great. This drama also gave some messages regarding transgenders and black people. We really should learn to respect everyone irrespective of their caste, sex, color or religion.Lead actor ""park seroyi"", I'm so impressed with this character. He remained calm and motivated every time and this inspired me alot.In short, Everybody should watch this drama. You will definitely like this for sure and also OST ""Start Over"" becomes one of my fav. song",positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,So I have been watching K Dramas for a while and know a lot of the cliches and the regular storylines you see a lot. I really delayed watching this drama as some of the reviews on here were not really rating the drama. So I finally started watching it a couple of days ago and all I can say is wow! For anyone who hasnt watched it start now. Its a great storyline and the actors and actresses are fantastic. I binge watched it till 4am this morning just to see the end of Park Seryous story. You have a solid storyline that keeps you wanting to watch to the end and get onto the next episode everytime. The story shows you life can be cruel and things dont always go you way. It leaves you thinking about life for a while after too. I could easily watch it all again. Great work by the actors believable characters.,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I don't know what it is about this show but I can't stop watching it. I find myself thinking about certain scenes a lot even long after I watched it. It's just so good. And the soundtrack is amazing. My personal favourite is 'Someday, the boy'. This song is actually like amazing I had it on repeat for like weeks after I finished it. The storyline is so good and it's not even boring. It's a good mix of romance and drama. It also talks about a lot of social issues which I thought was really good. I would 100% recommend this show to anyone.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"So I basically decided to watch the whole kdrama on Netflix since I wasn't able to find the Webtoon anywhere. However I'm glad I did watch the drama since the webtoon pretty much had the blandest art I've ever seen ngl (no offence to the artist btw). The colours and the scenery man are just stunning like seeing the breathtaking views of Seoul day and night just blows you away!I was really enjoying nearly all the characters. It was even unique that it added in transgender character who really needed more screen time to be honest. Lee Joo Young did such a nice performance as the character! I really wanted to see more of her character and Ryu Kyung Soo's character together! The character I obviously couldn't stand is Jang Geun Soo who always simping over Yiseo and just turns his back on Park Saeroyi a few times. He is like a ""damsel in distress"" character like for effin sake man, wipe off from the story jeez! Btw the actor who plays him is cute tho, I'll give him that lol! To add, it's also good to see an African man join the group too, I like the fact we have a kdrama representing diversity woop woop!!I gotta admit the whole thing took the whole day to finish it so the length to finishing it is ridiculous. Fair warning to all who have busy lives! I really enjoyed it though like it is worth the binge! It's emotional, funny, gorgeous, tense, nearly everything you do or don't expect in a romance drama depending how you look at it! Just watch kg guys, it's a decent kshow to check out if you don't want to read the Webtoon!",,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Loved this show so so much. I've seen many kdramas, but this was truly at the top of its game. Loved the principles and beliefs behind the show. All the characters were so rich and thought through. It's a show really worth watching!",positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,"This show was really good i'd say for the first ten episodes, even up until the episode where they won the cooking show. The show then started to go south when it went from that to 4 years later, it got predictable and the storyline felt old and re-used. It had been 4 years yet they were still talking about the same issues, especially the love triangle with the boss. Episode 15 in particular was a snooze fest showing flashback after flashback and too much scenes of him in heaven with his dad. Overall, i'd still give this a 7 because the ending episode wasn't bad and i was highly entertained especially at the start and middle portions of the show, i also like the values and beliefs they were showing such as discrimination and sticking to one's principles.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"This Kdrama is unlike other Kdramas which don't have a good storyline but are filled with romance. This show is unique in that it doesn't revolve around romance, it will still keep you hooked with just it's great storyline, plot, twists & great passionate acting of protagonists. While the story unfolds we as audience learn very valuable life lessons so it is a very teachable series. The lack of romance doesn't mean lack of love because it depicts a very unique selfless, pure, unconditional & passionate kind of love which is not limited by romance. Love so true that a person is willing to bet their life on it on one side, while for someone it takes years to develop instead of love at first sight. It also tells us that love at first sight or first love is overrated while true love is the one that grows stronger with time by overcoming hardships together through years. This show also stands out in showing good range of diversity & unique characters - Hero with great principles, badass sociopath girl, ex convicts, transgender, good guy turned bad, half black half Korean guy, career driven modern day woman, nerd, bully, evil businessman. Overall- it's a must watch Kdrama.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,I was thinking of rating it 8/9 initially. After 11th episode it started rotting and ended to just 2. Yo Soo Ah had done nothing wrong to be faltered by Sea Roi. It would have been finished way better with a Sea Roi- Soo Ah match!,negative,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,"I was skeptical but once I started it, I fell in love with this Kdrama. It single handedly addressed so many social dogma as autocratic system, racism in Korea, blending of transgenders and social barriers etc.
What I loved the most was that every character is an oddball including antagonists. They are not just black and white but contain their own humanity.
It's not those romantic comedies, and it's about sturggle and practical issues of life.
Highly recommended.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"This drama revolves around Park Saeroyi, a guy who believes that he can do anything he wants and tries to beat Jangga Co. all the while sticking to his values of integrity. It made me question if there is anyone like him who falls and rises to work towards the same goal although it's pretty impossible to be achieved. I came to a conclusion that not everyone is as lucky as him. Anyway, it's good that Yi Seo and Saeroyi ended up together. Yi Seo worked so hard to make him successful and happy.I feel touched to see Yi Seo giving Geun Soo a hug when he asked for a handshake during their farewell. He was very very faithful to her but she couldn't accept his feelings. I also feel sorry for Oh Soo Ah. I like her character in this drama because i can relate to it. She is an orphan so she has to work harder to live a comfortable life. She studied hard, received financial aid from Jangga Co. and worked for them. ""I am an employee of Jangga Co. and I will always work for Jangga Co.""She is a successful manager and I like how successful she is after working her way up. She is pretty and capable. I want to be that kind of woman. She waited over 10 years for Park Saeroyi but he fell for someone else instead. I like how she doesn't harbour ill feelings towards Yi Seo and wished the couple a happy life. After being the whistle blower, she did well in running her own pub and hired an attractive chef, something which comforts me.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I have to agree with some of the reviews on here. It started great!.. I even gave it a 2 thumbs up on Netflix because of the first few episodes.. Then it's slowly becoming annoying when they introduce the annoying love interest that Yi-Seo has for Sae-Ro-Yi.. They could just make her a strong independent girl/woman instead, just like the strong independent transgender, Hyun-Yi but no no no.. they have to create a love triangle instead! That ruined it for me! They should just stick to the love connection between Sae-Ro-Yi and Soo-Oh, it's more believable and would make a great ending!.. To make things worse, to show that the situation is all alright, they make Soo-Oh meet a handsome Chef to ""rectify"" the plot.. didn't work! I do like the rest of the story tho, that's why I kept watching it till the end.. but I did fast forward the annoying ""love"" scenes between Yi-Seo and Sae-Ro-Yi, urgh!.. really not convincing and ruining the story! And because of that I changed from 2 thumbs up to just 1.. I have seen the trend in Korean dramas where they ruined the story by some unnecessary love story! PLEASE STOP DOING THAT!.. 😐",neutral,"Drama, Romance"

I've watched exactly a hundred and twenty six Korean dramas, yeah I keep records. But this, this is a master piece. It even converted half of my classmates to start watching Korean drama as a whole. This is truly worth it. It's supposed to be the highest rated Korean drama. It also portrays how the contemporary Korean society is with tourists, other races, racism, and not-every-main-lead-is-a-'chaebol'(rich ass).

Instead over 16 pisodes it rambles and the plot holes and unlikely coincidences become too obvious. There is an interesting sub text going on about what sort of cpitalism - peope or power - os best and some good points on loyalty and friendship.But why is the boss clearly autistic and lets his first love hang around for 15 years (without visibly ageing by the way) and then dumbs her for a girl who is close to being a stalker. Glad to see some diversity in his employees but nothing was ever really explored and were they moonks as well like the boss.I enjoyed this show except for the ridiculous last three episodes.

Yes it has romance in it, but that's just one part. It's a whole lot more than that. It's also a thriller, action, comedy (at times), and others. It's about: business, entrepreneurship, power & influence, single-minded obsession, ruthless ambition, relentless persistence, revenge, family, friendship, love & hate, betrayal, diversity, bullying, acceptance, overcoming obstacles, grit & street smarts, violence, corporate greed, murder and cover ups, and a lot of other things and none of it is forced.

The idea of an underdog going against a big corporation is not new but this one was executed perfectly. You won't even hate the parts you are supposed to. It's just so uplifting in every part of it. Perfect revenge story with a great moral boost for those who will for sure relate which in this case pretty much most of us.,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"ITAEWON CLASS has a lot of heart. The emotions elicited by the show are on a whole new level. The story is filled with love for family & friends, as well as love for oneself & others. The first two episodes are extremely heavy, but once you get past them, Park SaeRoYi & his Danbam crew will take you on a classic hero's journey.I've never seen Park Seo Joon perform with such zeal. He embraced his role as Saeroyi & poured his heart & soul into it. Though some may regard him as a softie, I admire how Saeroyi remained true to his principles, for better or worse. I's inspired by the importance he placed on integrity & his practice of putting people first. You'll notice his endearing habit of stroking his bowl-cut hair throughout the drama. The gesture humanized him & distinguished Saeroyi from the other characters Seo Joon has played to date.ITAEWON CLASS has all of the elements of a good K-drama. Because of their vulnerability, each character is well-written & realistic. I like how the romantic aspect of the drama was subtly woven into the plot. My heart was racing because the love triangle between Saeroyi, Soo Ah & Yi Seo was so unpredictable. Yi Seo's vulnerability in putting her life on the line for Saeroyi, even in the face of unrequited love, tugged at my heartstrings. Her determination to support & protect Saeroyi exemplifies what girl power is all about. She won me over & inspired me to support her because she never expected anything in return.Another aspect of the script that I liked was the ending. Although the plot spans 15 years, it concludes successfully, with elements planted early on coming into full bloom to support the outcome. For what it's worth, the time I spent in ITAEWON CLASS resulted in a memorable experience. The drama was entertaining & inspiring. It also brought the Itaewon district to life. The drama left me with two important takeaways to remember: people should be at the heart of every business & dreams are worth fighting for.(Ps- It has THE BEST OSTs of recent years. Sweet night- My favorite. It can be played on loop. Start over- Very motivating)",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"This drama started strong for me, but somehow limped to the finish. By the end, the only thing I liked was the music. The love story seemed kind of rushed.

tt11239552,"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean romantic drama with 16, 60 minute episodes.Park Sae-ro-yi (Park Seo-joon) is a person with a very strong sense of justice and moral integrity. He is an only child being raised by his widowed father and the father and son are the most important thing in each other's worlds. Sae-ro-yi is very goal driven, his dream is to become a police officer, but the dream is shattered when he inserts himself in a bully situation. As the eldest and only legitimate son if the Jangga group, Jang Geun-won (Ahn Bo-hyun) has been groomed by his father to think of those of lower socioeconomic status as beneath him. He is a bully at school, which leads to a violent conflict with Sae-ro-yi who is not the type to stand by and allow it. When the high schoolers are disciplined the school allows Jang Dae-hee (Yoo Jae-myung), Geun-won's father and CEO of Jangga group, to decide the punishment. Since Sae-ro-yi's father happens to work for Jangga group and is a favored employee Dae-hee says he will forgive what he perceives as an insult to his son and family if Sae-ro-yi will kneel and apologize. Sae-ro-yi does not feel as though he has done wrong and refuses to kneel. He is expelled at the recommendation of Dae-hee and Sae-ro-yi stands behind his son and is forced to resign. Things seem to level out when Sae-ro-yi's father utilizes savings to open a restaurant but tragedy strikes and Sae-ro-yi's father is killed in a traffic accident by, none other, than Geun-won. At first Sae-ro-yi does not know the culprit but when he chances to find out who it was, he nearly beats Dae-won to death and serves a 3 year prison sentence for attempted murder. Sae-ro-yi spends his time studying business toward the goal of opening a competing business, DanBam, and ruining Jangga group. An unlikely group of employees/friends work for Sae-ro-yi and he also has the help of a social media guru, Jo Yi-seo (Kim Da-mi) who, after several chance encounters with the affable Sae-ro-yi vows to stay by his side and help him reach his goals. Sae-ro-yi's school friend and first love, Oh Soo-ah (Kwon Nara) works for the Jangga group and Sae-ro-yi still has feelings for her. Will a school drop out and ex-con be able to pull off the take down of a well established conglomerate like the Jangga group? Will Sae-ro-yi go with his feelings for his old love or is this new woman more of his second half?Spoiler Altert** This is a great story that reminds of so many other good stories I have seen in the past. It has elements of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and some Rocky Balboa like elements as well. Like his father who the viewer got to know briefly, Sae-ro-yi is one of those rare people who lets nothing deter him from the right path. He is kind to those that deserve it and harsh on those that do harm to others. The people around him make mistakes but he never holds those types of things against them and it causes everyone in his inner circle to like and admire him. At first I was cheering for his first love, to be the FL and main love interest, but as soon as Yi-seo entered the picture I loved her spunk, energy and the way she was all in with whatever she was doing, including her pursuit of Sae-ro-yi. One of his inner circle is transgender and I was surprised that it portrayed the South Korean people as not very tolerant of different sexual identities. She was one of my favorite characters. Another person in his inner circle was black and there was a lot of prejudice about him being a black Korean. I loved how his business model was about his people and how they, as a result, respected him and loved him like family. He accepted them all for the people they were black, transgender, a little bit psycho and helped them realize their own potential. There were some characters tome that did things that did not make sense. Sae-to-hi did change and harden just a bit which is not such a bad thing but did result in him not forgiving to the same level he did in the past. I loved the friendships and the love story. There were some slow parts toward the end where an element of the story was dragged out more than necessary. Very good and I highly recommend.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"I really wanted to like this drama but I come away feeling oddly disappointed.In what I assume is netflix's influence shining through, themes such as racism and bigotry towards the LGBTQ community are touched upon and mostly with a deft hand. A welcome change compared to the conservative ""normal"" dramas.Yet there are just so many flaws. I am glad that at several points during this show, it gets mentioned that if you get the basics right, you will succeed. Well, let's examine where Itaewon Class didn't get their basics right then.The first few episodes are great, set up the premise perfectly, make you interested and empathetic with the main characters. Sadly, starting in the middle and especially towards the end, this drama squanders all this hope and becomes a repetitive, boring revenge plot, sacrificing the emotional stakes and relationships.What is also to be lamented is the fact that Yi-seo somehow manages to be even more unlikable than Soo-ah and that is saying something. I get subverting the genre staple of having a childhood connection/ soulmate vibe/ meant to be love story and I am all here for that. But Yi-seo is so terrible from the get-go and don't even get me started on kissing/ caressing a sleeping character who has repeatedly stated he has zero interest in you romantically. That is just gag inducing.Now Soo-ah, I was intrigued by her character in the beginning. But it just does not make sense. Her ""excuse"" for dedicating her entire life to a man and a company that killed her only father figure, covered it up and had someone she considered at least a friend pay for it: ""I am not like you, I am not brave"". Huh, well then. She is smart and pretty, and Mr. Park paid her tuition, yet instead of going to university and finding a job, she ""HAS"" to work for Jang Dae-hee/ Jangga? Yeah, sorry as far as character motivation goes, that one makes no sense to me.
Also pray tell what is that nonsense that is supposed to be her relationship with Sae-ro-yi? She seems to genuinely be conflicted but how does she have any loyalty towards Jangga? make it make sense! Also it is beyond any stretch of the imagination that two people somehow are single without any ANY dating or even any interest in doing so for 20 years. Like what even... Why bother making the viewer care for their relationship? I don't even know how many episodes I spent waiting for her to come to her senses, quit Jangga and go over to Sae-ro-yi to tell him she had been an idiot all these years, loves him etc... Instead I had to watch Yi-seo stalk him and basically assault him for episode after epsiode.For the record, I stopped watching around episode 14, I just couldn't take it anymore, it started to feel like work, getting through the episodes.I am glad I watched other dramas Park Seo-joon did before this one, because I would not be interested in watching anything with him based solely on Itaewon Class. Not sure who is to blame here, but his acting is convincing and heartbreaking in the first few (2) episodes and then he becomes this mostly expressionless, boring character for almost the entire show. I guess there isn't all that much you can do when the character is what it is.So yeah, disappointed in this show that could have been so much more. Would not recommend.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,What happened? Did the show just give up at the end? Weak plots and cringe worthy cliches. There were certainly a number of great episodes building up a good underlying story focusing on an underdog and a revenge story. Massive disappointment starting from episode 15.,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"To date, I have watched 81 kdramas. From older ones to new ones, and across different genres. I loved many of them but only a select few linger in your heart. This is one of those that stay with you. I feel like I viewed something very significant and special. I found this drama to be a powerful story about growth and evolution of the human spirit. When one person can singularly focus on one thing and mistakenly feel it's the only thing that matters, they tend to lose sight of other values. I loved how the main character, Saeroyi, traveled a long journey, while arduous; it not only helped him achieve his goals but he learned the lessons he needed along the way.As for the love interest, I was so happy that he chose the right person for him. Despite his 10 year crush, I don't think he ever really loved Soo Ah. His interest in Soo Ah was a lot like his focus on his revenge. It was just something that was a part of him that he believed kept him going. Meanwhile, all along right in front of him, his own words about the people he loved and who loved him that actually and truly were by his side were the ones that gave him the strength. Soo Ah cared about him but she never did anything for him.I also really loved the message in this drama. That sometimes life is a little repetitive. We endure it and can overcome anything as long as we are alive.My absolute favorite line in the movie is when Saeroyi says to Yi Seo when she said life was nothing and like a chore.""When I wake up tomorrow, I'll open the restaurant and spend the day working there. Your life may seem repetitive. But no one really knows what could happen tomorrow. Seung Kwon once tried to start a fight with me, but now he's a waiter at Danbam. You made my pub get suspended, but now you're the manager. Not a single day was predictable for me. Some days are tough, some days are sad. But something fun always comes along every once and awhile. It's been happening more often ever since you came. Everyday is full of excitement. Your boring life might turn into an exciting one.""Loved that so much!!!Park Seo Joon is an amazing actor.

I like the way how this drama touched the current social issues like racial discrimination and LGBT. However, I waited for something special until the end and didn't find any. PSJ's character doesn't have anything special (except for his determination & kindness towards his staff), other than than, he doesn't have what it takes to be super successful. I don't understand how he managed to beat a multi national company when he doesn't know about business ( no development from beginning til the end) and with his recipe which I didn't find special. You can also skip some episodes and still understand the entire story. PsJ acting is good but he doesn't have to scream every time. :) I feel like he can use different techniques to express his anger. The ending was so unrealistic as well.

tt11239552,"It was so good up to a point. When they become a big corporation, you start losing the connection with the characters, but more importantly the love story plot was disappointing. How did he suddenly change his mind? Especially when it was revealed that Oh Soo Ah was sacrificing her own love and dedicating herself to a life goal, just like Sae Ro Yi has been all those years. Their determination and personal sacrifices were so in tune with each other, it would make so much more meaningful story, especially because it's less realistic in real life (after all it's all about the fairy tale stories, isn't it?).

tt11239552,"I honestly don't get the hate for the main couple. Some are saying it was rushed and some are complaining that the other girl is better. I disagree with both of these statements.1. Not rushed:
The change didn't start after the timeskip. If you payed attention, you would notice the changes in the male lead before the timeskip. Like how he got emotional/agitated easily because of her while he could always be calm even when his ""crush"" backstabbed him. That was already a big tell in the beginning. You could see how he gradually got used to her and how he became uncomfortable when she wasn't there. Honestly didn't felt rushed at all. I wouldn't have been surprised if they showed them dating already after the timeskip. Because it was just logical that with their gradual progress they would end up together after 4 years. Male lead is just dense. Otherwise it wouldn't take so long. Spending so much time together, feelings will grow naturally. Wich one will you remember and get familiar with? The one you see everyday or the one you see once a week/month.2. Good that he didn't end up with second female lead:
I would hate it if he ended up with her. Their ""love/like"" felt like an obsession. There is no way that a like/love can stay in tact after multiple years of no to rare contact (in any form). Rekindling of old feeling I coul get. But I think the male lead just clung onto something that had passed already. It looked like a stubborn thought that didn't want to be swayed by anything.Plus the fact that too much happened for them to just be together happily. I just didn't see it working. Even if she had her reasons, she CHOSE to be on the other side. Even if she was planning her own revenge, that doesn't take away years of standing on the opposite side. Yeah she felt upset that she had to do that to him, but that was a decision she made the moment she chose that path. I just can't see the possibility of smooth sailing after all of these things. She abandoned him, hurt him repeatedly and then cried about it when she made her bed. I don't hate her. But I did hate her for him. She always kept him on a leash.There are many valid bad points about this kdrama. But these 2 don't belong in the valid category in my opinionBut overall really enjoyed it!",positive,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,"An optimistic heartwarming revenge story that's all about the people.It's not a tragic story but a story telling of a person who is optimistic, he fought with those who wronged him without abandoning himself, his principles and his people.Itaewon Class is about fighting for what you think is right, even when everyone is against you. It shows the importance of our choices...if you make a mistake, you should take responsibility for your actions, but if you are doing what you think is right, no matter what you will not regret. Above all, it has a very clear message that there is nothing you can't do if you try hard, you just have to get up again everytime you fall.The drama tackles many social issues like injustice in the criminal system, the power of rich vs hardship of poor, discriminations in society, gender/racial issues, taking advantage of orphans and what not.Now, talking about the characters,
the best part about this drama is watching the growth of the lead and side characters. Each character changes throughout the show, completing arcs which are believable and well-earned.Park Sae Joon: Dude! He has the worst haircut of all time. Couldn't avoid mentioning that Sorry! Which was the main reason I pushed this drama till now.Talking about his character...He compels you to think about yourself and your life, he has an interesting view about the world. He loves his people no matter what.His tenacity, stubbornness, and ability to continue to persevere through all the obstacles that have been thrown at him by Jang is what eventually will win your heart. He is positive, emotional, encouraging and has guts.Yi Seo- It's so rare to see really cool female leads that are smart, mean, and likeable. I love the character of YS for not pretending to be nice, for being smart, strong and confident, and being able to fight for herself and her love. Moreover, she doesn't even feel bad for being a badass. I love the way she has no guilt in telling everyone that she is a sociopath. That's the strength of her character. I like her!Soo-Ah- You got to see a lot of character depth in her, and her inner conflicts about what was right and wrong.Jang: He has seen a lot, struggled a lot to be where he is right now and to remain on that position he can do anything to anyone. He can behead anyone also he can bend his knee infront of his enemy just to save his company. His character is cruel and has been played impressively.I find him an inspiring negative character.Geun Won- Ahn Bu Hyun delivered a superb role as a son who longed for his father's love and trying to get it desperately. He is trying enough for the girl he really liked can still love him. He should be loved but...Geun Soo- He sympathetic and loving when he is an outcast but when he decides to join his father, we can see a dark side of him which is a reflection of his dad. He betrays the very friend who accepts him. There was a ""enough is enough"" moment with him which made him what he became.OST: It has THE BEST Soundtrack of recent years!Sweet night- My favourite! It can be played on loop. Hello Army!Start over- Very motivating

tt11239552,"To begin with, I've seen 20 doramas and this one is one of my favourite. I can say that at the first sight it's one of these gripping korean TV-shows with perfectly looking actors and actresses and a predictable storyline but in actuality It's a bit different.Usually if you spend at least 1 minute thinking about how a korean dorama will end after watching its first episode you will know easely almost every important plot twist. Well, it isn't bad if you are a beginner in exploring asian romcoms or you don't care but in any other cases it is. So, what's the difference between Itaewon Class and any other dorama?First thing is main characters. They're not typical. A protagonist and his team are not really special. Most of them are not gifted or have a great number of money or skills. Two things that they definitely have are hard-working and their goal. And this magical duo helps them to achieve everything they want. And it doesn't matter who they are, a former criminal or a trans person or a teenager.Secondly, it's not easy to predict what will happen with characters while you watch it. The plot is able to surprise you in every episode by clever jokes or an extraordinary way of the story.Last but not least is the level of acting, background music, costumes and operator work. Everything was made incredibly well. There is no moment when you can say ""it would have been much better if they..."".All in all, Itaewon Class is an example of perfect TV-show production. I think everyone who search for a good serial should try this one.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt11239552,"Pretty decent show end to end, got draggy towards the end. The material was good for 13 episodes, but because they needed to stretch it out to 16 episodes, the last few episodes were filled with long drawn out unnecessary scenes.Addressed issues such as mental health, the trans community, foreigners in Korea etc, and the prejudices these different groups of people face.Almost every character was substantially developed, except for one of the main characters, Yi Seo. Which was a huge pitfall for the entire show. She, remained childish, entitled, unforgiving even till the end. EVERY OTHER main/supporting character showed development. Be it in maturity, forgiveness, self-awareness or self-improvement. She was goal driven, but her goal was a shallow one. To get Saeroyi to fall in love with her.For a show trying to cast light on social issues in Korea, romanticising sexual assault was gross. Just because the perpetrator was the young female protagonist madly in love with the male lead, doesn't make it right.The fact that in the end Saeroyi fell in love with such a shallow character who stalked him and pestered him for 4 years was a huge turn-off.Itawon Class TL:DR - Psychologically damaged male lead falls in love with his stalker who remains childish and obsessive even after becoming the CFO of a huge listed company and getting the man of her dreams.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"

tt11239552,"An excellent drama where the main theme is revenge & I'm a big fan of Korean revenge films. Having lived in South Korea for a year, I know Koreans are a proud nation, and knowing their history it's understandable. Korean actors never seem to ""phone in"" their performances; they give it 110%, no matter the importance of their role.This is my third K-drama & I've noticed writers like to add a ""twist"" to the story to throw off viewers. I do understand some suspension of belief must be held in this fictional world, but I do like intelligent writing that does not insult the viewer. And most of the writing in this drama is intelligent, but I couldn't fathom how the male lead (Park Saeroyi) fell in love with his manager (Jo Yi Seo). First, she's much younger. Second, she's plain looking even with tons of make-up. Finally, and most importantly, she doesn't have a winning personality that would enhance for her looks; she's actually a complete brat. I love how in the final episode, in a tense life or death situation, she runs away like a coward brat and leaves Chairman Yang's youngest son to fend for himself. He had deep feelings about her during the whole series, unlike her boss (Park Saeroyi), who showed NO like/love interest in her until near the end of the series.To be fair, Park Saeroyi is somewhat of one note (but extremely focused), ""no-game"" dude who still hadn't kissed a girl by 34 years old.........weak! But throughout most of the series it's obvious who he has deep feelings for......his middle school crush (Oh Soo Ah). He even stated in episode 2 he likes her because she's ""very pretty"". And she is fine. So fine, that him and the Chairman Jang's oldest, rich son have the hots for her. But she is more than just a pretty face. She's intelligent, successful & driven and deeply cares about Park Saeroyi. Yes, she is a little shallow, but given her characters background it is somewhat understandable. She was abandoned by her mother to an orphanage. Nobody loved her, and she despised any pity thrown her way. Considering this scarred background, she turned out well. And she is NOT an irritating brat. The Jo Yi Seo character comes across as a nutty stalker type that will profess her love for you for many years, and will kill your pets & slash your tires if you dare go for another woman.The writers got too cute. They should have written the series as more of an obvious love match. Have Saeroyi & Oh Soo Ah be together at the end & have Jo Yi Seo slowly fall for the younger son of Chairman Yang. He was a good-looking kid & had positive traits. The reason his character changed and became more like his sinister, but smart, father was Jo Yi Seo drove him in that direction. Actually, I'm not sure what his character saw in the Jo Yi Seo character. But I guess you must put aside all realistic plotlines in the fiction world of K-drama.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I cant agree to the people who says this is cringey, I love how they deliver the lines, the tone and characteristics it's all well played,, and if I ask you who would portray these characters better I bet you couldn't think of any because they literally suit the characters well.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Right from the start I'm thinking:
""Yo! Oh NO! Women and girls don't need to be watching this!""This story follows the lives of art students, particularly Nabi's group of friends. Though the focus is on their love lives, the stresses of classes, projects, competitions, and future plans factor heavily in the story. The protagonist is Yu Nabi, a beautiful and talented but resigned, student.The show starts with her painful break-up. She is then quickly seduced by the powerfully sexual Park Jae-eon (Song Kang from Sweet Home-8.5 & Navillera), who is a notorious womanizer. They couldn't be more different, except for the ""road closure"" signs on the way to their hearts. She starts a physical relationship with him but continually doubts him. He never asked for more anyway. This type of dude is not good in real life. Users like this tend to be on the sociopathic scale. Naive girls will think the can change him, that they'll succeed where other women have failed. It won't work, girls. You will get your heart shredded.""It's making me so uncomfortable,"" was my thought, from EP 2 through midway when there was a plot shift. At the same time, I was also thinking that the director & actors handled the seduction scenes well. They are as steamy as the kitchen in a noodle restaurant. Nabi moves on to other guys. She has no shortage of admirers herself. These relationships may make her more at ease, but there are clearly no sparks, such as the ones Jae-eon ejects when he's performing his craft.My method is: No reviews without watching the entire show, intolerable pain being the exception. If I had broken it off with Nevertheless in the early episodes, which I was not enjoying, I would've had a much different opinion than I now do after watching every frame. A solid 25% (it seems) of the early episodes consists of Nabi staring with an emptiness that showcases how a hammer shattered her fragile shell. Her emotional core is pulverized. She's struggling with school. Nothing is going right. She's shut down.Nabi brightens up in the very last scene, when she settles on the next step in the direction of her future. She smiles radiantly, her voice lifts an octave or so, her words suddenly flow with ease: She's confident. There was so much transformation in that last smiling sentence that it was breathtaking.The director, Kim Ga Ram (Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency -7.4), created her own piece of art in this series. This is Kim Ga-ram's third effort. All three are rated solidly with an increase in the IMDB rating for each one. We should be looking forward to more excellent offerings from Ms Kim. Screenwriter, Jung Won, is just getting started.Not only was Nabi's transformation handled aptly, but there are many scenes that are excellent, with imagery and metaphors noticeable in the first watch. (Another go-through would only reveal more.) In Ep9, for example, Do-hyeuk gives Nabi an umbrella. He told her it will rain. He has an extra umbrella. Cut to Jae-eon who looks out at the deluge, umbrellaless. Do-hyeuk was prepared for heartache. He had braced himself. He was ready for rain. Heartache snuck up on Jae-eon. He never saw it coming. Several others in the extended group, who had been longstanding friends, also pair up. Their romances were all done well.Adorned with a butterfly tattoo on the back of his neck, Jae-eon claims it means: The ugliness & pain of happiness & a lack of freedom. While Jae-eon has looks, money, talent, and popularity, which are all things that people believe will make them happy, he's not happy. He's lived free with many women, which left him not free to pursue a meaningful relationship. It's obvious that Jae-eon's dingy apartment -it's almost grayscale- is emblematic of his closed off heart. ""Nabi"" means butterfly. Nabi emerges from her chrysalis at the end of the show. That emergence had nothing to do with a man. The criticism of Nevertheless promoting toxic relationships is not fair. Nabi's confidence, in the end, was from, by, and through HER, not anyone else. This show is a cocoon that yields it's beauty right on time.The sculpture on which Nabi labours for the entire semester appears lackluster, just as Nabi does. She takes a step toward joining society by finally taking on assistants. The reveal for finished works will be the end of semester art show. What's on display is Nabi herself. Nabi's piece has taken up wings to fly. The process and the show are the stages of a butterfly. The matured Nabi powers through her entrapments in full stained glass splendor. She might as well fuse with her sun-catcher and bracelet.This is a well-crafted show. I would give it a rating of around 7.6, but it doesn't rise to the level of a solid 8. The director will likely be there with her next effort. Nevertheless, this series is well worth watching. It's not like the 3' deep cutesy romances. The director has crafted something more complex. In fact, I would classify this as a drama about self-awareness and self-liberation first, and a romance second.QUOTE📢Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you. ~Nathaniel Hawthorne~〰🖍 IMHO🎬8 🤔6 🎭8 💓6 🦋8 ⚡1Age 15+In order of ~lite&trite~ to ~heavy&serious~ you may also like:Modern Day:

tt14518284,"I had high expectations for this one, because I really liked it after watching the first episode. But as the series went on, I started to dislike it. It glorified and romanticized toxic relationships. The ending of this show just made it all worse. I feel like I only watched this for the side characters' plots, which I really liked!",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Before I watched this drama I kept reading EVERYWHERE, how the character Song Kang plays was sooo toxic and that he was such a bad boy, and I was really looking forward to see him playing a character like that, well that's not what you will find. He plays a guy with deep emotions but wounded and that doesn't know how to love ( or doesn't really want to) until he actually does and falls in love with Nabi. Not ONE TIME in the show he disrespects or hurts the female lead in any way. He never promised loyalty nor exclusivity and she just has different expectations ( Korean social standards are very much narrow minded when it comes to sex and intimacy in an open way).I find this show very realistic and aligned with how people actually behave in real life and I enjoyed watching the characters struggling trying to find the way of being okay with their feelings and learning how to express them.Loved the representation of LGBT relationships and the other secondary couples where adding a lot of warmth to the story.The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is because his show would have been priceless with a better script, the potential of passionate and raw dialogues this one has...!!! Instead its a lot of unsaid words and unspoken emotions. But I enjoyed It throughly regardless.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,I loved the show until the last episode. Why did they have to finish like this? The main lead from beginning to end acted like the personification of toxicity but at the end he became a relationship material. It doesnt make sense. I was hoping that this drama gave us a slice of a life not a fairy tale. Dont get me wrong I was not a team potato. She obviously has some issues to deal with. In my perfect ending she doesnt choose neither of them and try to learn who she is because her preference of men is really concerning.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"First of all, NOT A TYPICAL KDRAMA. I m seeing reviews saying this is vulgar. OMG PPL! What are you? 13? Let's just be honest and agree that the world we live in way more vulgar than this and this drama is just a reality of ppl in their 20s.Both leads are amazing in jobs and extremely professional. I just watched an interview where they were watching their kissing scenes and kept on rewinding that lol. The amount of self confidence it needs for anyone to do that HIGHHH.Hays off to Song Kang doing so many projects back to back. Literally running from one drama shoot to another and yet maintaining the quality of his performance on point. Hope this season ends well and Netflix gives us a season 2 and not ruin the season 2 like they ruined love alarm's season 2.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,Only one episode left but Nabi is still urgh.. This is really frustrating both characters doesnt know how to express their feelings its like both of them are having a game of charades. They technically making both their life difficult by always assuming ang never ask or verify the actions and words. They obviously have the connection but they both want to mess it up.. THIS IS SO MESSED UP STORY and now we are down to one more episode and im disheartened by episode 9.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"The best thing about this kdrama is how the male lead deals with consent. He consistently expressed his boundaries and what he is offering. He is pretty forward, but he makes very clear moves and backs off if he notices she is not ready for it. Not once does he disparage her for rejecting him or setting her own boundaries, he always just smiles and let's her be. He listens to her. I think that's what makes this drama compelling and hot. And it's such an antithesis to the usual dramas which seem very sweet and loving and innocent, but are often rife with people taking advantage of each other, pushing the boundaries of friendships, and the classic grab her by the wrist and drag her of somewhere to talk or tell her off... Ugh.Some good side romances and nice to see some lgbt representation.Its a straight forward romance, not much more to it and not enough there to give it a 10, but so good for what it is.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"To be frank, I love the vibe of the drama, the newly added characters, the production, but I hate the ending. I read the entire manga over the summer. It tells the story of a girl falls in love with a playboy, soon realizes his nature, and then ends up dating with the second leading which seems to be nicer, kinder, and better, but the uncertainty still remains in their relationship. This drama however turned this story into a common, boring ""bad guy gone good"" story in the last episodes. It's certainly unrealistic. The screenwriter either misunderstood the core value of the manga or formulated it this way because someone as him or her to do that. I know that there are people who love this ending, but it does not please me.",unknown,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,The rise of popular dating apps nowadays made this K-drama more realistic. Kim Ga-Ram brought typical commitment issues over young characters in (art) university. You might hate their repetitive cycles and undecisive acts but still rooting for nice settlements.Uniquely there's no major 'parenting' or 'family' involvement through ten eps. These couples solve problems on their own. Song & Han have a lot of charm and courage to do steamy make-out scenes as Jae-Eon & Na-Bi though i slightly prefer Bit-Na & Gyu-Hyun and Yoon-Sol & Ji-Wan stories.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Nevertheless might have been much better, if there was a good storyline, likeable pair of lead characters and a bit decent pacing.The story never felt like romance, instead it was 90% complications for the leads, which I felt kind annoying and the end wasn't compelling enough. I personally like the lead characters (So Hee Han & Song Kan) but there pairing felt dumb, disappointing and it never kept the show to be interesting. Instead I was quite amazed by the pairing of the supporting characters, which were developed quite well.The only positive thing about this drama was the music which I felt was soothing to the ears and quite melodious. Along with that, I loved how the relations developed among the other supporting cast, which was way better showcased than the lead characters. It was a wasted potential, Nevertheless.Cons:
Unlikeable lead characters
Weak storyline
Less of love story, more of irrelevant complications among the pair
The pacing was very slow, with couple of episodes being flat boringPros:
The OST was soothing and melodious
The supporting casts had a better relationship development.My Rating : 5.5/10.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Oh I loved this. So different to everything else out there.I thought the pace, cinematography and music was stunning and seemed to perfectly capture how beautiful and awkward love and sex can be. Some have said in their comments that it was slow but this was one aspect which I loved about it. Tender moments were shown frame by frame which is so true to the webtoon. I could feel their breath and hear their pulse. Slow, smouldering embers can light a forest fire and this series had my heart ablaze. Song Lang's smile melted the heart and then sizzled the soul. The acting from both leads was flawless.This series is not for shallow waders. To fully appreciate that love's still waters run deep, one needs hold one's breath and dive in.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,A naive art student is drawn to a fellow student even though he is known to be a player. The leads are convincing as both have character flaws which affect the way they interact but the sexual tension is palpable . A few interesting side characters and it is well acted but the main problem with the show is the slow pace.,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Anyways I did watched everything, you will think by the end there's some growing for the main character, while the whole story has been about a not so great love and lack of self appreciation, you end up with the same generic ""happy ending"" with two not chemistry whatsoever couple. I was hopping each character departed ways, but you can't go away with the happy ending couple that mysteriously get fixed after hurting themselves so much, forced love is never love...finally was trashy.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I am totally loving how Netflix is turning the heat up on K dramas. While nothing overly explicit is shown, the way the sexual tension is presented is just incredible. Whoever is directing those scenes is doing a fabulous job. (See also minutes 3 - 4.5 of ""Love (ft. Marriage and divorce) S2. E1!)The supporting characters are also really relatable. A great example of life in your early 20s.Only downside; just one episode a week!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Korean Drama 'Nevertheless,' gives a new perspective to college dramas.The drama has a pretty original story, bold and original, about a toxic relationship that is acknowledged by the lead and yet she can't stop it. It has a realistic aspect to it and a more mature mood. However, the ending was pretty cliche and ruined what the drama had built. The personalities of the main characters, especially the male lead, were also a bit vague and they should have been portrayed better. However, the love triangle was interesting and the side characters were pretty entertaining and they added a lot to the story, with a unique flavor and strong stories.Finally, the performances were enjoyable and the atmosphere that the drama created, along with the OST, quite beautiful.So, overall, 7 out of 10.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"To me this drama was a piece of art.The music, the cinematography, the pain and the passion, the tension and the longing. I was absorbed and I loved it so much.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,It's funny how the reviews here said the female lead can't act when only her acting is being praised by Korean netizens what a bunch of idiots who don't know anything about acting Song kang is a meme in Korea and some reviews here are praising his acting are you serious the dude can't act lmao.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I love this kdrama because it is different from the others. It's not the same formula that we're use to and I love it. I'm glad it's a little racey too. I'm expecting an ending of them growing together but not bring together but I'll be happy if they end up together too. I really enjoy the main leads scenes together. I love the other two couples too. Just waiting on one to realize that they should be a couple. I keep calling the main leads relationship toxic but I just can't get enough of watching them interact. If ur looking for the regular kdrama formula, don't watch. But if you're looking for something a little different. Enjoy yourself.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,Unlike old dramas where it takes 15 episodes to get to first base this modern series hooks up the couple quickly and has the physical relationship before the emotional. Han So Hee acts quite differently from World of the Married. Sweet and vulnerable. Song Kang acts as a guy women are drawn too and so naturally he doesn't commit 100% to one girl. But he is young so why should he be so serious anyway. Things are confusing at first when the viewer has to sort out all the different friends including a lesbian relationship and one where the girl wants only a casual physical relationship. There is a tedious part towards the end when she is too insecure and can't accept less than a full commitment from him. Was rooting for her to just go for the secondary lead.Not a must watch.,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,Really liked the first episodes but then it just turned into a run of the mill boring k drama girl likes two boys but ends up with bad boy who messed with her head the second couple were good but then they cut his scenes and even blurred out his face because of some old scandal 🙄of him so say cheating on his then girlfriend- yes really korean cancel culture at its worst the two girls who liked each other were a breath of fresh air and they played their parts well not a drama I would watch again.,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I LOVE THIS SERIES!!! I hope there will be a Season 2 in Paris! It would be really beautiful aesthetically and a great storyline. The lead actors are rising stars. It's a drama about talented young twenty something art students learning from mistakes made from the inexperience of youth. It feels authentic and real. You feel the emotional pain they carry from failures with family, friends and mentors. The intimate scenes beauty and emotion was magnified by the director's close up camera shots. I like the mood of the soundtrack, especially Dream No. 24. The entire ensemble cast was interesting. I hope the cast is proud to have made this series. I am thankful to have watched it. It doesn't matter how this series is critiqued. It is art. Experience it for yourself, or experience something else. I just watched it again and I like it even more!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"If I have to be honest, Nevertheless is for those who are watching dramas for a cathartic experience and not necessary for its nuances.The plot is simple, there are no mysteries, no ifs and buts. Yet if you want to watch two actors putting you on an emotionally involving ride that's bound to end where it should (and you know it too), then you've got to watch this. There's nothing grand in the scheme of things in Nevertheless, but little glances, small smiles and touches make it whole. For every person who would want to watch something that takes it time to bloom, supported with two pretty actors and some nice music, Nevertheless is a good watch.Don't go in expecting too much from the story, rather, go in expecting a good experience and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"The relationship between Yoon Sol and Seo Jiwan was literally the only reason I watched this show. They were sweet, genuine, and their story actually had real substance. Unlike the main story, which was just straight up annoying to watch. The main story was so slow, boring, and promoted a toxic relationship. It was frustrating seeing Jae-eon unnecessarily insert himself into Nabi's life like a scheming fly. Even though Sol and Jiwan had very little screen time (a crime if you ask me), I felt a lot happier seeing them on screen than the main couple.0/10 for the main story
11/10 for Yoon Sol and Jiwan.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"This for me was the most realistic, well acted, well made K drama. The actors do a brilliant job of portraying the characters' struggles and their chemistry is off the charts. Very tastefully made, from a woman's point of view. I liked that it was not childish or cheesy like most other k dramas.Unlike other dramas there is no other sub plot - like action or mystery. It's all about romantic involvement between 3-4 couples. So I understand if some viewers were bored because of that but that's what made it stand out to me as there was more time to go in depth into peoples behaviors and motivation.I wish there's another drama like this made soon!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"So, it's not the best k drama i've ever watched, but for me it was kinda entertaining. I've liked the secondary characters, not really the main ones.They were kinda stupid, especially the girl. Idk what to say about Jae-eon. He was a little toxic at some point, and that he changed so much was pretty unrealistic.Also, Na-bi doesn't know how to make decisions.Overall, it was entertaining but didn't give any good message.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"You can't help but hate Park Jae Eon and love Park Jae Eon at the same time. The leading actor Song Kang is a perfect fit for the role as he brings romance, and a certain calm in his slow charming seduction of women. I admit I haven't watched too many Korean Netflix Series, but this one seems to depart from the ones I have seen in that it is definitely a bit racy. But I thought it was a welcome change with the right actor. The story is set at a college where the art department majors all hang out and make friends. Park Jae Eon makes friends with benefits, if you know what I mean, and he is so good-looking that all the girls fall under his spell. He is upfront with them from the beginning that they are just friends and is not ""dating"" them and are they OK with it? The many girls he dates is like a kaleidoscope of butterflies. Of course in reality what girl is going to be OK with that. I liked the story because anyone in the US can relate to this series. Many groups of friends will end up sleeping with each other only to be hurt in the end. The whole time while watching the series I could imagine the song going through my head ""Maggie May"" song by Rod Stewart,
""All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed, and in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more"". (although Park Jae Eon was doing it in a gentle way, but Nevertheless.) They should have used it for a theme song because it was very fitting. Is Park Jae Eon just a cold human being with no sense of how he is hurting people or is he capable of falling in love? The main characters Park Jae Eon and As Na Bi were very good. I was very happy with the way it ended.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"If any of my friends ever tell me that they're dating anyone who acts like the people in this show (appart from Sol), then I'll probably die. None of these people are who you should want to be with or who you should settle for.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Nevertheless is one of the most underrated drama. It may seem slow paced but that's what makes it more attractive and creates the tension. For me it was a beautiful the way the actors portrayed the characters and conveyed their emotions through expressions without much words. It is different from and not a typical romcom which makes it unique. Love is not always hearts and roses, it is sometimes confusing and irresistible. Both of the leads were insecurities born from past experiences. However, they had different expectations, priorities which created complications despite having mutual affection for each other. I loved the ending as well it is kind of open which does not show a happily ever after kind of vibe. So we just know that she chose the one she really likes for time being which we all would have done in her position. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every bit of the drama and binge watch it as well.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"It coul be a great story! I mean, I liked the idea. But they could tell it in 5 spisodes max! The main storyline is quite boring: all those pauses, silence, roaming around like a zombie. It felt like nothing's happening. I always wanted someone to shake this girl, so she woke up! She's always somewhere in her mind! And she never knows what she wants! Him too. They met each other in the beginning of the college year and it took them the whole year (all 10 episodes) to finally say those words: ""I like you! Let's go out!"" Hallelujah! BUT at the same time it was okay to become friends with benefits right at the 3rd(?) episode!Secretly!About that. I think I will never understand Asians. Everything is secret from everyone! Especially when it comes to relationships and feelings. They are always in denial about that and push away people they are falling for. Like this is something to be ashamed of. And it was irritating. All 10 episodes I wanted to scream: ""Admit your feelings to yourself for starters. Then figure out what exactly you want with him. And finally have a proper talk! Ugh!""It felt like a teen drama. When everything's new and for the first time. But this is not the case. Both main characters have experience of relationships. So that seemed weird.Watched this series only for Song Kang while waiting for the last two episodes of ""My Demon"".<3.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"This show is truly disappointing in the way it romanticizes and normalizes toxic relationships.

tt14518284,"At first, I want to conclude this drama liked to me, but it wasn't revealed till the end. I believe that would be more understanding of focus on two lead characters. The ex-boyfriend of Yoo Na Bi had accurately displayed her nature in his creation which so embarrassed Na Bi at the exhibition. Park Jae Eon has quickly perceived this essence.

tt14518284,So I actually enjoyed this drama. My only gripe with it was that the main protagonists go back and forth quite a bit. I found the rest of the cast and their relationships to be much more interesting and dynamic to be honest and that's what made me continue binging this. All the other characters had their own personality but the protagonists always stay depressed for the most part and I didn't see much growth in their characters. Oh Bit Na was my favorite character and is a huge reason I stuck with the drama. Overall its worth the watch especially at only 10 episodes.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"

tt14518284,"This show was so good for the first 3 episodes and just like that it wasn't anymore. It was so jarring i had to keep checking if I was watching the same show.You're probably thinking, 'you just hate the lead guy. He's handsome, charming and effortlessly seductive. Know what he wants and takes it and doesn't fit good guy ascetics.' But THAT was why I loved the first 3 episodes so much. It's his toxicity that sells the story. Taking what he wants with very little consideration of the feeling of the people around him. Trying to rehabilitate him was the mistake. He, believe it or not, didn't actually matter to the story. It's her choices that should have been the focus. The first 3 episodes understood that. He's everything she wants but shouldn't. The other love interest(Eun Han) in the first 3 was a very safe choice she should want that and even does. But is ultimately drawn to the lead who by all accounts is a walking red flag but NEVERTHELESS...After the 3rd the show shots it's self in the foot by trying to justify her wants or create rationales for why he's not actually who he is. And after than it's very obvious what the plan is and it's not fun anymore. The YouTube chef doesn't actually present a real threat as a viable rival to Park because we now know who she ends up with. All that leaves us with a a very boring show.There are about 4 couples in all and every side couple is a 100x more interesting the the lead couple. My favorite has to be the Sol and Jiwan and the only reason i was able to finish this show.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,I wasted 5.5 hours of my life on the first five and a half episode of sixth. I like dramas based on reality and I like the fact that it's not like a typical kdrama with 35 year old virgins or people with no previous relationships but it is not deep at all when they're trying so hard to make it feel like the characters have layers. Extremely boring and dry characters with zero chemistry.The soundtrack though: wow!!!,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I think that a lot of people don't get the fact that sometimes expressing your feelings is not that simple, this drama show exactly this, sometimes is hard saying what you really want to say because you're trying to protect yourself from getting hurt but the thing is this, sometimes all you have to do in life is taking risk and do what your gut says to do, use less your brain and more your heart, it may go bad but it also may go really good you'll never know...I really like it especially because they show more of the intimacy between the two main characters and let's say it, it's a revolution for kdramas because they never show anything... and they were capable to show it without being vulgar, the scenes were so sweet and super romantic in my opinion.My advice is: give it a try, it's not about a toxic relationship, although it may look like one, pay attention to the glances, to the words, to the actions of the two main characters.. plus, the other storylines between the other characters were really perfect and cute.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"The concept of the story is brilliant: art students, seeing how they work and deal with issues at the university, it's inclusive (LBGTQ), diverse and original.But then it's as if the person with the idea and the writer of the story are very different people. The writing is very slow paced, the conversations are extremely slow and not at all how young people would talk and act. The emotions are flat lined. Young people are energetic, vibrant and act way faster. The main characters even walked and moved extremely slow.The more I watched the show the more depressed and anxious I got.The only reason I finished the show to the end is because of the actors. They are all really good. The quality of their work is phenomenal. They were able to take a bad script and still deliver the story in the best possible way. I also liked that they added some scenes outside the university as the beach and the metro station. Anything and everything about Korea is interesting to see.",negative,"Drama, Romance"

I felt bad for nabi bc she was done dirty too many times. But picking jae eon is so realistic because that's exactly what i would've done lol. But when i finished the series i felt a bit weird beacuse i know she should've ended up with potato boy bc that would've been better for her but she chose jae eon. (i wanted her to choose jae eon 😭) i watched this drama ages ago and i've rewatched it a couple of times because i will never stop thinking about it. I liked the intimacy between the two because it's not something you really see in kdramas. I do feel like this drama gets too much hate and i would recommend to people that are open minded enough to see through nabis point of view and how realistic her choice was.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"The people who hate this drama are stupid. This drama was meant to portray the toxicity and reality of some relationships, just watch their presscon. I know it's frustrating but it's realistic. This is not an ordinary kdrama where they put rose-colored glasses to the viewers, like do people really think that relationships are all perfect? People who experienced being nabi will not hate nabi. You should dig deeper and understand it with depth not your shallow eyes to understand why nabi and people like nabi acted that way, the traumas she experienced from her own family and ex. From my point of view, there are many people like Nabi, that even tho you feel exactly the opposite of the way you acted, like even if it's super suffocating, there are moments in life that we act differently from what we feel because most of young people who are still naive in love are heart>brain, don't act like you're all super smart at first. More than that, Nabi clearly doesnt love herself and is lacking of love and trust ( due to her experiences with her mother and ex) so she dont know how to understand her own emotions and she dont know how to identify what love is. Family have such a huge part in one's view in love and how one handles relationships. Also, the constant manipulation of jaeon are also seen in the drama, he clearly knows that nabi likes him but he acts innocently while secretly holding nabi on the neck. The way he said ""i want to do it with you"" that moment nabi saw him kissing another girl, it's like blaming her because she did not pick to kiss him before.This drama is comforting in some unique way for me, maybe because i understand nabi so i was able to sympathized with her.

And suddenly realised I was in love with the daringness of the director to craft a film about obsessive, paranoid teenage love, when hormones and fear are at constant battle with one another. This was a refreshingly honest series about what it's really like, not given an adult gloss of nostalgia, but a realistic, cutting and gloomy study of young love. Yeah, it's a slog, but like Tarkovsky's Solaris, it's an art film with great depth, great acting, editing and cinematography.

Not airing it is the ostrich policy: I don't want to watch (but especially I don't want my kids to watch it) sexual things in dramas. Oh well, guys, there is an old joke about asking questions on a certain radio show: Question: ""Can I talk to my kids about sexual things?"" Answer: ""If you want to learn something new, yes!""

Yet throughout the movie, I found myself frustrated with the main characters as a couple yet rooting for them as well.The frustrations of being in a relationship should have lasted the whole movie to reflect the title; where the characters hold onto to each other even though it is crystal clear, that they are incompatible. The main guy character should have been a douche-bag (bad person) the whole movie.

tt14518284,"Overall this is a fairly good Korean take on the Friends with Benefits theme. A slow burner with an OST to match. The filmmakers even invested some thought in the titles of episodes and managed to put a story ""in a nutshell"" - just 10 episodes! I could not help the feeling, however, that the way it was filmed, especially in the initial episodes, the film had some qualities of portraying a stalker. The scene where the heroine visits an exhibition featuring her ex's exhibit piece, frames depicting fragments of the body of the characters (lips, eyes, etc.) or emphasis on touch were chilling - had I not done my homework, I would have thought I have chosen the wrong genre.",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Jae-On and Nabi's relationship might remind a lot of viewers of what they've experienced in their younger years. Interpreting glaces and stares, analyzing every touch, rushing into things and overthinking every step. This show is bundle of uncertainty, anxiety and self-exploration. I can see why a lot of readers might be drawn away from Jae-On really fast, as he is very flawed. We are confronted with a lot of miscommunication, unfinished conversations and a lot of insecurity. But this is reality and it is real for a lot of young people out there. What makes this Kdrama outstanding is the a) how the storyline enfolds through Nabi's perspective and b) how the storytelling is reflected by the camera angles and shots. As you might have known already, there a lot of sensual scenes (which is very unlikely for a Kdrama) between the main leads in the very beginning. But it's not the unconventionality that makes this Drama special. It's the slow-paced shots, the glances, the shortness of breath, the detailed framed faces. This is something which I have never seen in any Kdrama before. If you like a cinematic experience paired with a sensual sometimes off-putting relationship between two very confused people, and a deep dive into teenager love, then this is the right show for you.",positive,"Drama, Romance"

Reminds me weirdly of 50 shades of grey in sense of here is a girl who is with a guy despite not wanting the kind of relationship he is offering.In this one she says no multiple times and tries to get out of it again and again and he just keeps pushing it. She finds a much nicer guy but then still chooses this dude.Im fine with it not being sensored like other k dramas, but the toxicity really grosses me out.Agree with others that the series 100% replies on romance storylines (and at that, sexual ones, not particular sweet or genuine ones) there is literally nothing else happening.By the end I just felt grossed out by the main male character which I'm sure is not what the directors / writers intended 🤢",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I am rating this drama a 9 now, before completion, because I want to share my thoughts... So, my rating is provisional, in case something completely bizarre occurs...
EDIT: (Something completely bizarre has occurred...)First, I'd like to say that this show is incredibly well done! I give huge props to the director, the writer, and all of the actors, who are doing absolutely stellar work here! This feels so real! Na-bi's annoying indecisiveness...her insecurities...getting pulled back in, multiple times, when she knows better...so real... Jae-eon's smooth game of push and pull, toying with her feelings, then pulling her back with some "" thoughtful"" gifts or gestures... This is Toxic Relationship 101, done to perfection! Based on personal experience, I feel compelled to recognize the absolute clarity in this work of art... I have not read the webtoon, and do not know the ending, but I hope they continue to do this story justice, and do not feel compelled to re-write their planned ending based on public clamoring... Please trust your work, it's very good...
EDIT: (it *was* very good...for the first 9 episodes... now I really wanna know how the webtoon ended... Unfortunate that there was only clarity up until the murky ending... Toxic relationships like this should no longer be portrayed as romantic... And watching/hearing that he fell for her as she was standing in front of that embarrassing sculpture her horrible first boyfriend put her name on just totally creeped me out...😱)I am hoping that Na-bi and Jae-eon do not end up together (as much as I love Song Kang's portrayal of this character), because, whether he is broken, or just a jerk, the idea that ""the right woman"" can ""fix"" a man like this is a disservice to young women who will be watching, and also to the character of Na-bi... It is not her job to make him whole. He needs to get healthy before he tries to have a relationship with anyone... I guess they could do a time-jump, but they would need to have plenty of time to make it clear that he had gotten therapy and dealt with his issues...
EDIT: (Well, unfortunately there was no time-jump, but they didn't even bother to have Na-bi try to ""fix"" him, she just accepted him, warts and all...knowing very well that she will be hurt again... Why, Na-bi, whyyyy?!? Not that I'm saying she should have tried to fix him, she should have shook him off like a hairy spider!).I also want to say, the pure devotion of the childhood friend, Do-hyeok, is being played to perfection by Chae Jong-hyeop... I appreciate how, even when he feels hurt or jealous, he never weaponizes his feelings against Na-bi... Can we hope that he remains true to his character to the end? This is what real love for someone looks like...
EDIT: (IMPORTANT OBSERVATION: Chae Jong-hyeop is now the guy we want to see get the girl next time (Casting directors, please take note)... and not by playing a character that is a jerk... don't misunderstand me, I *do* love bad boys...but bad boys that reform themselves because they are motivated to become better people, or bad boys that were only ever ""bad"" on the surface, and were really squishy soft on the inside all along (Choi Young-do from The Heirs, Han Seo-jun from True Beauty)...Not a self-centered character like Jae-eon, who we really didn't get to see make any positive changes, or even a commitment to change...freeing the butterflies was not it... And did everyone develop amnesia about him flirting with the lady at the bar and taking her to ""see the butterflies"" while Na-bi was out of town?!? And then he had the nerve to tell Na-bi he missed her! Not that night, he didn't...)Additionally, I've read that the part of Kim Mingui is being reduced/edited out because he (supposedly) did something that wasn't acceptable, which, while not a nice thing to do, is an error in judgement, not a crime... He is, what, 26? Plenty of people don't know what they want (or how to go about getting it) when they are that age... Could he have found a better way to handle things? Probably... So, fine...call him a bad boy, and don't date him until he gets his head on straight... But, mess with his work? Not cool...no need for that...
EDIT: (I was very pleased to see that Kim Mingui was not heavily edited out, although we cannot know how much greater his part may have been minus the controversy... I was happy that time was given to resolve the relationship between his character, Nam Gyu-hyun, and Bit-na (the characters were so great together, as were the actors! Great chemistry!)... I could have happily had much more of them together onscreen, but hopefully we will see them both again very soon)Also, in my final edit, I would like to give major props for the LGBTQ+ romance, which was very beautifully done by Lee Ho-jung and Yoon Seo-ah... every loving relationship in this series was heartwarming, except for the one between Na-bi and Jae-eon... Disappointing they didn't finish that appropriately...While the ending may have been truthful, it is not a truth that serves well... ""young woman refuses to give up toxic guy, even though she knows he will only hurt her again""... I get that this turmoil might appeal to very young women who don't know they deserve more, but couldn't we have had instead, ""young woman with potential decides to give up toxic relationship to focus on herself and her art""...? Or, ""young woman realizes she is in a toxic relationship and ends it to be with her first love, who truly understands and cares for her""...? My only hope for how this ended is that there is a Season 2 in the works... The series overall was very well done, I'm just dismayed by the message... I get that young women will make bad choices and get hurt, but let's let them know there's a brighter future that can be had...Final thoughts... This was an extremely well-crafted (for the most part) series, with absolutely phenomenal acting... I would have to say, it seems like a success in that it created two very polarized camps (🦋 vs 🥔) which generated a lot of buzz... I read that the ratings in S Korea were not that high, but I don't think ratings tell the whole story anymore... I'd say this is a WIN for Netflix...
If only the ending had made more sense this could have been a 10 for me...",neutral,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,Very much different concept compare to other kdrama. The thing is it is just a 6 episode story they dragged it. I like the chemistry between the leads it soo hot.. they both are good actors. I really feel second lead is not necessary in this drama.Male lead is not a biggest red flag the way people are portraying in social media. He never promised her neither he confessed her. He always draw the line between them. I know this is bold concept but you can read this kind of story in Wattpad. Female lead have some expectations that's why she is hurt that's it. He is never misbehaved with her. It is always miscommunication and misunderstanding Between them Which leads to fl to think he is not good for her. And I don't blame fl bcz he is also never confessed about his feelings so she is right in her insecurity.To be very honest what is the reason to introducing the second lead? I don't understand.,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"This drama had great potential. It was not a typical kdrama. The message it could have delivered going along with the webtoon would have been great. But, in the end, this did what Game of Thrones did. And threw all that potential to the air and went with a typical kdrama ending.First of all the drama had great subplots. The ""soljiwan"" couple, who were two best friends realizing their complicated feelings and coming to accept their love for each other, their LGBT representation, their chemistry, and they way they emerged unscathed in a society that still condemn gay couples, quickly made them my favorites.Then the story about the wild girl Bit-na and her best friend was great as well.Then we come to the main couple. Who despite all the intimate scenes (I applaud the director for the sensual and bold takes) and cheesy dialogues, lacked any chemistry.If anyone tells you they are HOT, they are simply talking about Song Kang and Han Sohee who are both really attractive people! But their characters with eachother had no chemistry. They could have been cut out from card board and uttering dialogues. Their sex scenes were so armature, I felt like watching two kids losing their virginity for the first time! (They were both supposed to be experienced).Then the pacing.This drama was boring from the start to the end. Apart for the side characters, the two main characters lacked any character growth as they ended exactly where they started. Remaining toxic to each other and themselves, throughout.Should you watch this drama? Watch it for SolJiwan! Skip the rest. You won't be missing anything.",negative,"Drama, Romance"

For me it was a kind weekly medicine. I really enjoyed it with peace.

tt14518284,"First off, this show made me feel the same way Cheese In the Trap and Love Alarm made me feel after watching it. Sure, the cinematography, soundtrack, acting, and cast are great, but the characters and plot progression ruined it for me. I was thoroughly enjoying this show the first few episodes because I was really rooting for the two leads to end up together and work out their problems, but as the show progressed it just dug itself deeper and deeper into this hole and now, with one episode left, I really have no hope for it.Song Kang's acting is great, but his character is terrible. I started this show because of the cast, and Song Kang is one of my favorite actors right now (as a straight male, even I think he's good looking), but this show does him literally no justice. Essentially, he's one of the ""main characters"" but is portrayed as a villain. Do-hyeok (another great actor) shows up through drama-line convenience in order to start a love triangle, which I did not care for at all. He's literally the total opposite of Jae-eon and is sort of forced down your throat as a loveable, innocent, and seemingly perfect childhood friend love interest whose existence seems to center around Nabi. Very little character to showcase and his personality just seems way too convenient for drama purposes as a second male lead. I shouldn't really even say second male lead, as he's basically the primary male lead at this point. Basically what happens is Jae-eon and Nabi are happy together for a second, and then some misunderstanding or doubt arises causing them to drift apart, and then Do-hyeok comes out of nowhere to kiss Nabi's wounds and Jae-eon is left on the curb looking like the bad guy of the show. I can't root for Jae-eon anymore because the show keeps making him look more and more like a jerk, and I can't root for Do-hyeok because his character is so uninteresting and has very little depth.Again, props to the acting, but boo to the characters. The show had so many opportunities to resolve some misunderstandings between Nabi and Jae-eon if they'd just give them a single scene where they sit down and actually communicate instead of making vague comments to each other. I was basically just waiting the entire show for at least SOME of the misunderstandings to clear up, but instead they just kept adding more and literally 80% of the scenes with Jae-eon alone with Nabi was just him trying to make-out with her. There are so many side characters with their own relationships going on, and literally all of them have progressed waaay further than the two leads. All of the side character relationships have been progressing at a good pace, whereas the two lead's relationship has been going backwards since like 3 episodes in.Even with all of this, my biggest frustration with this show is how they execute Song Kang's character. They initially made his character seem like he was going to try and change in order to be with Nabi, but instead they kept digging him deeper and deeper into this hole. Are we not going to clear up the misunderstanding that he had a girlfriend while he was seeing Nabi? There's one scene in particular where Nabi finally asks Jae-eon about him having a girlfriend, and instead of replying like any normal person would (by saying no, I don't have a girlfriend), he instead says ""does that matter?"" What. Why? The misunderstanding could have been cleared up right then and there.I think I've ranted for long enough. Overall, started off good and then fell off. Lots of misunderstandings, very little communication, so many side relationships, and super convenient and depthless love triangle.",negative,"Drama, Romance"

Yes, there is always a worry that feelings will develop when trying to keep just a sexual relationship however if there are these feelings, do they need to be spaced out over multiple episodes without much else going on or could they have been faced and dealt with so that we could just move on?And that last episode, it left me feeling so irritated.

Other relationships and characters in the film are weak and seem like fill. Scenes are repeated too often, like classmates going out after class and getting drunk.

Seriously...
Then in the last shots we see two girls taling to Jae-eon and asking him for his number but he doesn't come right out and say he has a girfrien (making it kinda seem like he hasn't changed) and then as they are walking holding hands Na-bi spots S-0heeok and hesitates staring at him??

And can I say this can be so RELATABLE at times!!?I am in love with the LGBT portrayal in the show. Non-stereotypical, sweet and realistic.

This Romance would have been an 8 or 9 if reedited down to 8 episodes - the episodes at best were like a slow moving train of events - the protagonists in each romance were well done but again were too drawn out and lacked realism - this was not a real life romantic series - it was extended to 10 episodes by allowing the romantic partners to have the communication skills of a tree stump.,neutral,"Drama, Romance"

tt14518284,"I can fully admit I only watched this drama because of the side couples and even that got messed up when they cut the screen time of one of them due to a scandal. The entire drama is slow, and extremely repetitive. Na-Bi and Jae-Won go back and forth so many time I got annoyed. That's why i ended up skipping most of their interactions and I only watched for Sol and Ji-Wan. However, I also held some hope that the show would end like the webtoon, with Na-Bi realizing that a man like Jae-Won would never change and just continue to manipulate her. The ending was extremely disappointing and upheld the dangerous idea that toxic relationships are okay. It's not. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"The show is really good! Even though we still have one more episode to go I'm very excited for more of what's to come with the all the characters love stories! Looking forward to seeing Na-Bi and Jae-on continue their love story! Same thing for Na-ani's friends!But before I give this show too much credit for how good it is, I feel it sort of follows Love Alarm so Season 1. And the reason why I say that is because just like love alarm Song Kang gets the girl and the chemistry is just right and things are going well until one little thing or situation messes up EVERYTHING!!! And that kind of drove me not gonna lie.I hate how they made Park Jae-on seem like a bad guy when in the end he's really not that bad, just bad at explaining himself, and Yu Na-Bi kept making my head spin from how back and forth she was with both Park Jae-on and Yang Do-Hyeok! Again I know there's still one more episode left but before she makes her decision it's obvious that she's likely to choose Park Jae-on. Because regardless of him promising to stay away from her, he's still gonna be around her I feel. And If in the final episode she does choose Yang Do-Hyeok, then I'm gonna need her to let Park Jae-on go and stop playing with his feelings and I'm gonna need for him to stop playing with her feelings. Because let's be honest they were literally friends with benefits for a hot second before all that drama kicked off with Yoon Seol-A, who I feel should have just left them alone.But anyways I give this wonderful yet blood pressure rising show a 10/10 because it's really not that bad, it's just I don't like how all of sudden Na-Bi and Jae-on are quarreling and her last words to him was that she never wanted to see him again knowing dang well she would. Again I just don't like how they felt the need to add conflict to the show by having Na-Bi and Jae-on separate on something so small when either one of them could have just communicated with the other about what was going on.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I was really looking forward to this one. Not only because the love story was supposed to be potrayed more explicitly which is a rare thing to see in k-dramas, but also because Song Kang whom I really liked in his previous projects but thought his potential wasn't fully recognized.However, I was dissapointed with how the story evolved throughout each of the episodes. There was a lot of repetition, lots of unspoken things between the main characters which only led to VERY BORING dialogues and created more confusion and made the story boring, imho. My fav episodes were the last 2 in which the main characters shone, the actors were great, but still, 2 good episodes don't make a great show.What I actually liked about this k-drama were the supporting characters/side couples - for me, it's a first drama where two girls got together, although the relationship was portrayed in a very subtle and delicate way, NEVERTHELESS, I loved those two characters. Other side couple (Bit-Na and Kyun-Hyun) also made a great couple - you could feel the chemistry, they were so fun to watch. It was a shame that the producers had to edit some of Hyun's scenes because of the actor's recent scandal, tho (I'd love to see more scenes w/ him and Bit-Na in the show).",negative,"Drama, Romance"

tt14518284,"While watching you may become sick of Jaeon's lack of feelings, but you won't be able to give up. Episodes later you will be awarded with the extraordinary sense of love and devotion. This drama is directed by a woman and it is told like a poem to my ears. It is seen in every romantic moment that is has been touched by a woman. After finishing the whole episodes, I couldn't help watching and watching again. Unbelievable chemistry between Han So Hee and Song Kang made me becoming a huge fan of them and then I watched all of their dramas. Still following them on social media and feeling proud of their success.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"This drama is one of the best I have recently watched. The characters are relatively deep, there are not much cliché as it is usually in a typical k-drama. The actors are so talented, I wasn't bored even for a minute watching their performance.The male lead actor is so extremely sexy: tall, slim, wide shoulders, long neck.There are light sexual scenes which are very nicely filmed, I mean, you can feel the tension between the characters. I loved it, so hot.Their relationship start as a magical fairytale, but then small mistakes change it for both of them. The characters cannot sometimes be sincere, and it leads to misunderstanding. Anyway, we will be given some happy ending.All in all, I'm really impressed with this drama.P.s. I watched it at 1.5 speed as I often do with k-dramas since they are usually slow.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,I want to like this ... I really do . But the drama is so excruciating slow . I fail to emphatize with the female lead because Han Sohee really need to work on her suppressed acting . Most actresses who does suppressed acting have to show emotions in their eyes ... I think it was just too difficult for her . That's a shame .,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"This series deserves a higher ranking than it's getting, probably because it's not your typical fantasy romance (which female viewers, in particular, have come to expect). What I liked:1. This show portrays sexuality in a realistic and frank way. Also, not all the relationships are heterosexual, a refreshing rarity in a Korean drama.2. The actresses looked and acted like grown-ups (or at least not like 12-year-olds).3. Anyone looking for violence or action/adventure won't find it here. The conflict between the two main characters is emotional and subtle-and not always obvious. Jae-eon, while a bit clueless, isn't the unfeeling, cruel heartbreaker that everyone around him keeps accusing him of being. Yu Na-bi has some contradictions too.4. The secondary characters are silly and infuriating--but charming. They mostly seem like real people. Han So-hee was really convincing as Yu Na-bi. The actress who played Bit-na was also impressive-and very funny.5. Loved the setting. The tribulations of the art students seemed realistic.What I didn't like:1. Why do the minor characters in Korean dramas have to remark endlessly on the good looks (or lack thereof) of the main characters? It's really off-putting and seems contrived.2. I sometimes feel that the subtitles aren't getting the real meaning across. (And not just in this series.)",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Began watching specifically for Yoon Sol and Jiwan, who are not given the amount of time and in-depth story they deserve. The rest of the show, in my opinion, is bland. The acting is not terrible - again, bland - but the pacing of the plot most definitely is.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I've seen people from various countries criticizing it being too unrealistic. WELL I feel endlessly thankful for this Kdrama. It portrayed a certain type of men out there perfectly. For me, this is a wake-up call. I would like to express my gratitude towards the screenwriters for depicting the psyches of emotionally unavailable men and the women around them so perfectly.I don't think this drama is to portray a idealistic romance of a repenting f-boy. It went into great details to show the twist and turns of how such relationships damage people. It goes above and beyond as to why these people are so good at emotional manipulation and why they are so hard to get over. When you watch this drama, you from a third-person perspective sees all the choices that Nabi shouldn't be making. But when you are in the situation, you 100% will do what Nabi does.Very well plotted drama. Deep, meaningful, humorous, and extremely engaging.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Its an amazing series!Th two lead actors have amazing chemistry.. at the age of 20 the feelings are immature, you try to understand the world, you want someone but you want to try other things.. its life! The eyes many tomes talk better and the episodes had a lot eye contact, expression without talking... i remembered when i was 20 years old , i was studying in law school and has such an experience as Navi and Jeon.. so refreshing to see that still there is magic!The friends were amazing actors... they added so much to the series...The relationship of the leads was about trust, devotion, understanding, trying to figure out who you are when you are studying and you live only with people of the same age... i remembered my years at the university... so much time to think, to fall in love, to cry, to laugh, to live!!Amazing emotions i felt ending the seriescongratulations to all actors, director, producer ... people around the world from different cultures feel the same, pain the same... fall in love ... amazing.",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"An extremely unusual and mature korean drama. Loved every bit of it and the performance of all actors was above repropach.I'm pretty sure there wo't be a season 2 since the series gives out the feeling that all characters found their true love in the end, but still would be nice to see a spin-off.I didn't find any vulgarity in the series and every step taken towards the character's destiny was normal, like in real life. You don't always start dating after falling for someone and things don't always happen like text book and this series reflects that very well.Great job overall for the whole series and thank you!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,Very mediocre acting + story that tries hard to be original. Characters were pretty dumb.,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,Watched it till the end the story is more than just a love triangle its about how people will learn and become better person in life and the truth that we will choose who we love not what people say and its great if we can be honest to ourself.,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,What to write.. its a boring story with the boring lead actor & actrees. And the rating in korea was very low. One of the lowest in history of k drama. Watch it and you lose your precious time..,negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Nevertheless, is my first kdrama that I have ever watched and now I'm hooked. The on screen chemistry between the two main characters was palpable and even the natural flow of the friends and their storylines made it a great watch. Not only was the chemistry on point but even the acting was refreshing and raw. I understand many will say that Park Jae Eon was toxic and that it is stupid of Yoo Na bi to try to fix him but the storyline was intoxicating for viewers...like a moth (or a butterfly in this instance) drawn to a flame!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I came to this show really for Song Kang, having been really impressed by him in another show. So glad I came - he and Han So Hee really hit this one out of the park. This is a story about two Art/Sculpture graduate students who first meet outside of the campus. She has been seriously hurt by someone she dated for a long time. She ( Na Bi - Korean for Butterfly) meets handsome Jae Eun in a bar, where he mistakes her for a ""Blind Date"" he was supposed to meet. Interestingly, he has the tattoo of a butterfly on the back of his neck. Her breakup is recent, but the attraction between the two of them is strong and real. However, it turns out that he has a reputation for being a Player, and insincere. This is the story of what happens to them as they navigate their feelings, each of them making mistakes along the way. It's important to remember that this plot was taken directly from a Webtoon. Some people have not liked this or that about each character, but I believe that they were very true to the original concept in their portrayals. And, as happens in real life, nobody is perfect here. The supporting cast was also just terrific, and each couple had their own stories to tell. For me, the chemistry between Song Kang and Han So-Hee was absolutely real and intense. So, I got a little curious, and being an astrology buff with software, I did a chart comparison between them. As I expected, the chart results told the story - they are off the chart astrologically too! So my advice to them is - don't let this opportunity go by! If you are not already dating, go for it! You won't be sorry. Your chart is pretty compelling! And, for the rest of you..... What are you waiting for? This story does not move quickly, but it is rich in multi layered and dimensional aspects, twists, and details. It is also beautifully filmed. Enjoy!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,To me it was not boring in any way. Loved every moment. Leads are very good.,positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"Female lead's acting is so bad I can understand that character she is playing is has to be confused but she doesn't look like confused she act like she is dumb don't know anything like absent minded person I literally was so excited firstly but it was disappointing that I had to left it in first episode it's my first time I left any k-drama. Although male lead is interesting her character and the way he presented himself in that character, I don't wanna say literally female lead's acting made me to give up on this show her acting is so frustrating far from pleasant 😶presentation....such a disappointment 😶",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"This show is AMAZING! It caught my attention right at the first episode, and I couldn't stop watching. I'm so glad I waited until the whole show was aired. Aaaaand, the lesbian relationship just made me love it even more, I NEED A SEASON 2!",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"The whole meaning of the comic which was what made it different from other stories was just throwed out of the windows. Giving it 5 star only for side characters, otherwise they just changed the whole meaning of the title ""Nevertheless"". Highly disappointed with the final episode. They turned the plot to every other cliché romantic story.",negative,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I really really enjoyed this drama. Especially the kissing and romance scene was beyond my imagination, I couldn't control my heart 💓 beat. I was so happy with the story line. Thanks to all that put it together especially the male lead and the female lead Thanks you guys love from UK 🇬🇧",positive,"Drama, Romance"
tt14518284,"I literally binged on it. I understand that the Korean public is not used to this kind of intimacy on screen but luckily the directors and actors are becoming more opened. Finally you got rid of the usual painful scenes when the actors were kissing they looked frozen like dead fishes or cartoons having a smooch. This is not the case,they look like real people and I don't see their relashionship as a toxic one,on the contrary I see 2 confused ppl in love with one another but they don't know how to handle all that. I really wanted to see more of the Lead actors,more passion,more conversations,more love,feelings,more commitment overall like a real love story:)The ending is perfect and hopefully is a hint that a new season will follow just as good as the first one,maintaining happy ending is a must so don't ruin it😅",positive,"Drama, Romance"
