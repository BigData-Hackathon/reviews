tt10919420,"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Squid Game is a show that will stay in your mind long after you watched it. After reading all the great reviews and seeing it was one of the most watched series in the entire world I finally found time to watch Squid Game. I have to admit that I had fun watching it and was very entertained throughout the entire season. It's about hundreds of contestants (who are all down on their luck and need money) that are asked to play children's games for an shot at winning a lot of money, 45.6 billion won (about 33 million dollars). The only thing is these children games are now all deadly and the last contestant standing wins all the money. It will pull you into its world and before you know it you'll be hooked. It's a thriller with lots of twists and lots of violence. I know it's already been renewed for another seasons so I hope they can keep the same magic they had for season one.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.Examples (spoilers!)1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.The gameThe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.""Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.The island, the leader and the policemanThe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.The secondary playersBetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...The old man and the main characterFinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"This show starts out amazing, and progresses amazingly too. The characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. There were moments that made me cry, which I wasn't expecting. There was a point around the middle of the season where I was ready to call this the best TV show of the decade.And then the VIPs came in.Their acting was atrocious, like The-Room-level bad. I was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. My only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in American dialogue. Not only did the VIPs break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of Hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.However, this didn't destroy the show for me, and I could have overlooked it. But then the show just sort of fell apart logically. First there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where I was just wondering throughout the entire thing: Why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? Why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?And finally, Sae-Byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. What was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? It angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. And maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but I feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. It's almost like the show said, ""Yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with.""Then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between Seong Gi-Hun and Mr. I'm-Completely-Selfish-Until-the-Plot-Demands-I-Sacrifice-Myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where Player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover VIP the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and Seong Gi-Hun); and then Seong Gi Hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the VIPs or something.I wouldn't have minded Sae-Byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. I wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. It's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.I still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and I can't overstate that. I sat back in awe many times and said, ""This is one of the best scenes in TV history."" I will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. There was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that I felt bored or disinterested. I feel like this show raises the bar for Netflix and I'm glad I watched it.I just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. If it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. And it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

In general though this is definitely worth a watch.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"The acting and character development from the main cast is outstanding! The storyline was AMAZING. I was hooked straight away.It would have received a 10 if the VIP acting was better, they were shockingly bad and sometimes hard to ignore.And there were also little things that were never finished/explained:
The coughing morse code from 28 to 29.The battery life of 29's phone, even the leader uses a landline.The police chief definitely caught some of what the police guy (29) was saying on the phone. Why was no back-up whatsoever sent to his location?Why did the last guy give up after just being bit in the leg but 456 was stabbed twice and able to fight and win? I'm guessing that he just gave up and wanted 456 to win?The married couple that returned and acted shocked that only one of them could leave alive. They knew there could only be one winner in the end.I was super gutted that the girl was randomly impaled by glass (why did they blow up the glass, it could have killed all three finalists, risking losing a final winner).Was 001 called number 1 as he was secretly the winner. Did he secretly want to let 456 win? Did he allow it to happen? Isn't that going against the ""fairness"" of the games?456 winning Squid Game as a child in the first scene in the pilot episode, totally ruined the series, I KNEW that would be the final game, so it was OBVIOUS he was going to win. I still enjoyed the ride, but it was something that at least should have had a flash back too during the last game, as I haven't seen anyone else make this comment; did they forget about it?His hair looked awful red. That is all.Why did he suddenly become impulsive and want to hunt down the gamers? Will their be a season 2? I don't understand how he thinks he can take them down; the police don't believe him and the leader/VIPs are billionaires so can hide everything/kill everyoneHe abandoned his daughter AGAIN.He was going to ditch the prize money AGAIN.When the first group of people were released, the prize money was meant to go to the bereaved families, but when the majority returned, the prize money remained. Does this mean they were lying? (because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?The leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if I'm correct, nothing came of this? I was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?One of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? I was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. Bit disappointed with that.How did that annoying woman survive? When asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? But she was a weak underdog? That makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?The police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), I kept thinking ""chuck it in the water so they're thrown off"" but no, he left it there and was easily found.Another police man one... He was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. His brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. How does this work? Or had he only ""disappeared"" during the latest games. This definitely needed more explanation.Now that I think about it, there were A LOT of plot holes, but during watching it and before I started analysing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and likely watch again! I love geeking out like this; that's how I know when I've loved something; when I can't stop thinking and analysing it!",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color?

tt10919420,"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians.

Hindi dubbing was far better than perfect. The dual element of entertainment was suspense & production design.Marvel's Loki is much better than this.

From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable. Yes there will be a second, and yes I will watch it because the actors are superb. But it still is not in the class of finest KDramas.However.

tt10919420,"*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,The basic idea behind the show isn't really out of the world about how you have to compete to death to gain something but the twisted fact that the show turns children's games to their ugliest and gorriest possible versions makes it a horrifying yet glued to Netflix kind of a watch.

tt10919420,"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

The only reason native English speakers find it bad is because they speak very slowly and clear, as the show is not intended for English speakers.I usually check reviews on FilmAffinity, (the Spanish version) and literally no one there was talking about how bad the VIPs were. So, for Spanish speakers, the acting doesn't seem bad. It is as simple as that.As for the show, it is a great show.

The background stories, moreover, set the drama apart from the rest of the survival game series, and it gives a more 'Korean Drama' feel to it. It makes the story more believable, as it helps the viewer relate to the characters and understand them. It also gave a more humane twist to the story and made it more dramatic, when the settings and the costumes were more on the childish side.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, 7 out of 10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all.

Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful.

This is a GIANT problem because the entire premise of ""we play fair games against each other, based on skill"" is throw out the window. Honestly, the series is pretty great before that, but after that, the series is a poor 5/10. If they didn't completely throw out the premise that the series was based on, half way down the line, then this would have been a 9/10 series.

tt10919420,"Everybody has been talking about ""Squid Game."" I've been seeing memes and costumes, and I was in the dark. I didn't feel compelled to watch it at all because I generally don't watch T. V. shows. I found that any show can make one or two good episodes, but then I begin disliking every character after a while. I broke down and watched ""Squid Game"" at the constant urging of my wife and to me it's meh.To me it's a Korean ""Hunger Games."" I know that there are some big differences, but it's still people playing deadly games for a prize. What has drawn in so many viewers is the fact that adults are playing kids games with deadly consequences. Of course, there has to be some exposition and character development in a nine episode show with each ep being an hour, but what we're all there to see is who will survive and who will be eliminated. Like those who go to NASCAR races for the crash.Maybe it's a victim of its own hype, but I wasn't that impressed. There were some impressive moments such as the first game they played and the pure shock of it all, and maybe even episode six when choosing partners put them in a position many of them didn't want to be in, but I will say that some of the 'umph' is taken out of a show when you know that anyone without a significant speaking role is definitely dying before any main character. I've labeled this spoiler so I'll say this: when you have a tug-o-war game with just about every main character on one team it's a dead giveaway that they're going to win no matter how weak and frail they look.So, to ""Squid Game"" I say ""Meh."" Only one character was halfway exciting or fun to watch and the side stories didn't interest me enough. If ""Squid Game"" were four episodes instead of nine I think it would've been a lot better.

As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more.

The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth.

And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game?

He could've helped so many people, instead he sat in a corner feeling sorry for himself for a whole year, pathetic! Then when he pulls himself together (red hair and all) he backtracks at the last minute and decides oh I'm gonna undo all my character development and do the stupid impulsive thing instead!

tt10919420,"Not sure what all the hype was about. The most enjoyable thing about this show is watching all of the horribly unlikable characters get killed off. The only problem with this is that as more and more people got killed, it provided more screen time for the rest of the unlikable characters. The premise and story are ok, but the execution ruins it.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

tt10919420,"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Not bad, but it's being a bit too over hyped. Seen better, seen worse.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,Koreans don't hold back. They make stuff as real as possible. They show how ruthless life in without any filter. This show was very well made and nicely paced. The games were well thought out and implemented. Even though we kind of know whose gonna win they masked that well. There was also good character choices and development in the film. The plot twist at the end was awesome too. Very mature dialogues and story! The sets were also well thought out and colorful and the background music was unique and fit well. Very entertaining show.,positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"

Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"Squid GameA very simple idea taken to extreme lengths. Much of the show was derivative, I can recall so many TV shows and films that had elimination by death of the contestants (Hunger Games , Logan's Run etc)leaving only one. Even the music was taken from 2001, A Space Odyssey. With that said several elements bought a brutal honesty to the narrative.Firstly rather than merely fortune hunters the contestants were desperate (bunch of losers), so desperate they were at the last chance saloon.The varying ages and circumstances brought a refreshing touch to a totally surreal reality this juxtaposition of tone was definitely something new.We had some great characterisations this meant we really cared about whether they lived or died, no moment was lost in developing this area.Following episode 1 the script writers wanted to drive home the ""losers"" back stories and how in financial extremis the possession of life and money can lay on either side of the weighing scales, inferring perhaps that a single human life does have an intrinsic monetary value. A deeply disturbing thought!The sterile styling of the game makers brought a sinister teletubbies element combined with the island of Dr No, not to mention the Escher type staircases.The introduction of some rather slapstick humour in episode 3 largely fell flat but the sugar game was very inventive as were the contestants solutions.Episode 4, the opening fight sequence indicated it was a fight for survival of the fittest and for a person to rise to the top others must fall to the bottom. There were some very clever devices used to keep the narrative impetus in what was otherwise a repetitive blandness. I thought the soldiers ""side-hustle"" of selling organs was brilliantly conceived.In episode 5 the leader explains that the players are starting again, within the game, from a position of equality, but this is a lie, as age, sex, education and experience delineate the competitors, just as it is in the ""real"" world. This was self-evident in the very next scene where women were deemed ""worthless"".The ending was so silly, money brings the power of choice, wealthy people have no clue how much money they have, better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor.Obviously as an anthropological/psychological study it gave a basic review of id drivers, (mainly the instinct to survive) there was no revelatory insight here, it was just great entertainment because we must remember instinct knows no morality.Within its genre of dystopian fiction it was a winner, it must be remember the effect of dubbing and subtitles makes art products more profound and so it was here. Overall I enjoyed it but it had a fatal flaw in that even in episode 6 contestants stated more than 1 person could win, when this is idiocy. In terms of violence I found nothing but ""manga"" comic book action, interesting but nothing shocking!I'm giving this a 6 outta 10, meaning I enjoyed it whilst I watched it but I never want to see it again. It was refreshing in that there was absolutely no snowflake woke fashion trend elements to this relatively low budget drama, I should give it a 10 for an authentic product in an unauthentic world.I read somewhere the writer wanted the show to highlight the disparity in class within a capitalist world, well that intention was an abject failure, it was gladiator for losers.",negative,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt10919420,"The writing, acting and almost everything else about it was so captivating and entertaining. I love the characters and the way that they make you feel so attached. Episode 6 is truly heartbreaking in terms of this aspect.The music was another thing I enjoyed. I can't quite put my finger on why the music was so perfect. It just... was.Although the acting of the white actors wasn't anywhere near as good the acting in the rest of the series, the rest of the show made up for itOverall a great show and I would recommend.",positive,"Action, Drama, Mystery"
tt11612120,"It might just be me, but the older I get, the less able, or willing, I am to grapple with multiple apparently unconnected characters doing apparently unconnected things. Season 1 is great. A close-knit group of people surviving a monster outbreak in a single, claustrophobic environment, where (as the title suggests) home becomes somewhere strange and terrifying. Monsterization is closely linked to human desire. Every monster is unique, and almost sympathetic. But inevitably, the filmmakers decide to expand the storyline, go bigger, move outside those constraints. The Matrix did it. Countless zombie movies and shows have done it. But it rarely seems to work. Involving the military might seem logical, but it kills the uniqueness of the premise, and turns an intense, personal drama into yet another generic post-apocalyptic mess. Monsters look the same, hunt in packs, have no personal connection to the main characters. Lots (I mean lots) of guns. And by the end of season two, I have no idea what's going on. Like I said, that might be me, but I don't think so. It's as if they're throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Not much, I'm afraid. I really hope season 3 goes back to a smaller, more intense storyline, but I doubt it.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"The first season was definitely worth watching. I'm trying to figure out why the 2nd season lost it all, as I fell inlove with the 1st season, but ended up finding nothing worth caring about in the 2nd.And as it turns out... The plot of this show was actually based on it's original webtoon. The 2nd season's storyline doesn't take place in the webtoon, as expected...It seems like the show was taken over by a whole different set of creators.During season 1, the monsters and their encounters were much more intense, captivating and so much more interesting. The whole setting was claustrophobic, and quite challenging in itself. It was all very suited for this imaginative horror show.... In season 2 that's what I was most disappointed about. It seemed like the monsters didn't belong in the same horrifying universe anymore, and they were no longer a major part of the story.Why shift so much focus onto constant drama between a variety of uninteresting, unlikeable, unbearable characters? It's frustrating how nobody is getting along. Everyone argues, slaps and punches each other. Never-ending bitterness, tension and moody whining through it all..? Liking someone apparently means being inlove with a person who doesn't care about your existence at all. Too many are simply heartlessly cruel, as well.What is there to love about the show, anymore? Is it just meant to get watched, not meant to be enjoyed?I'd recommend season 1, but to ignore that there's more episodes after. All we can do now is hope that season 3 might find it's way back and somehow remember how it was meant to entertain, or perhaps some of us should just go ahead and read the webtoon instead.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

In the other I cried for that character and prayed for him/her not to die. I loved watching them become a family.

Eun-yoo basically replaced ji-soo as the female protagonist, while in the first season she was just a child now she's magically become this strong woman. NO. I WON'T ACCEPT THIS. I AM BEYOND ANGRY AT THE PRODUCERS AND THE WRITERS BEHIND THIS. The actress didn't have time to shoot? You put a scene where you give hope to people and maybe try to shoot more for season 3 AND GIVE HER CHARACTER THE ATTENTION SHE DESERVE.Honestly I don't even care what happens next, they had more money but some monsters are still awfully made, the intro sucks compared to the first one and the main themes were better in the first season, nothing can compare to WARRIORS by imagine dragons.I'm sorry but season one remains the best.

Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they'll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

Yes, the CGI isn't the best, but it's also not the worst I've seen either.
The core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can't help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons ""Warrior."" I can't really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second.

tt11612120,"Sweet Home (2020) is a Korean horror television series available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a virus outbreak that turns people into monsters. The storyline evolves around a group of survivors inside a residential high rise building while chaos takes place outside.The writing for this is very inconsistent. The first four episodes were out of this world A+ action and horror scenes. It was so fun. I thought this show was Amazing out of the gate. However, the storyline quickly shifts from the cool monsters to the humans hybrids and their conflicting feelings about the surviving humans. Overall this series had a lot of potential and falls apart halfway through.

I'm not sure if this is Netflix's fault or not, but their shows often go downhill in following seasons. They change too much for the worst. I have been fast forwarding a lot of season 2 because the dialogue is so boring I can't even focus on it. I'll probably eventually finish it just to see how it ends. But I will continue to fast forward a lot.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Season 1 was great, a novel and entertaining season. Season 2 however has a lot of what made S1 great now is missing.One of the biggest problems I have with the show is the protagonist. He turns half monster for the entire season, but other than the healing ability he is completely and I mean COMPLETELY useless compared to other monsters. The first problem is that he will not fight. He will stand there and take punches, hits, stabs cuts and wont lift a finger to fight back because he doesnt want to hurt people. Talk about ridiculous. On top of that they tried to give him some monster ""wings"" so that he can fly around with these monster wings on his back, but guess what""? They literally only gave him ONE wing on his back. You dont have to be an aerospace engineer to know that one big wing on only one side of your back wont work and shouldnt fly, but of course it somehow works. It looks ridiculous though. I am sure they thought it was going to look cooler than it did. All of those things really annoyed me about this season but what really got on my nerves the most was him crying. He is crying in every single episode he is in. Multiple times, and he cries and cries and cries. This is an adult man who is supposed to be a monster but instead cries like a baby all the time. They destroyed this character and had the chance to make a character that was cool powerful an strong yet we got this mess. What a disaster!!The entire second season is lackluster also in comparison to the first. The story is all over the place in S2 and bounces around a bit too much.Other than all that negative stuiff, the show IS still entertaining. Some of the monsters are interesting but the CGI this season was much worse than the first season. This season we got monsters that look like transformers made of garbage (they show up in a few episodes). They make the monsters move intentionally very fast so that the camera doesnt zoom in on how poor the cgi truly is this season. The is entertainment value to this show still!!

tt11612120,"6 stars I am giving only for season 1 which had its unique charm about it and not being like all the other zombie shows out there. Although having limited characters, each had their own back story and were given a chance to develop in their own way throughout the season. Every monster was great and different (coming from they're own personal desire). So all this was good about season 1
season 2: remaining characters from season 1 are transported to this stadium for some time where there are 400 more people and it is really hard to catch up with everybody's motives. In the process of focusing on these other characters, plus the ""Crow"" army people (they're good guys fighting the monsters), the main characters are either killed off or given very less screen time. Believe me when I say this, but even the main guy (who's face is on the poster and who is supposed to be a ray of hope in this dark time) has less screen time. Monsters became mediocre and less scary, most with a generic zombie look. The cute kid became a bully, the nerd guy became a gambling moron, a prominent girl from s1 is killed off early into the season, the ballet girl is lost in her own mission to find her brother. I don't even remember what happened to the others but this season wasn't memorable at all
all in all, I think s3 will probably get cancelled if this is how s2 went. A lot of fans are upset as I am.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Hard to really describe the show. Its definitely fun and entertaining. The CGI tends to be a bit crappy, if the monsters were more ""consistent"" their CGI being low quality would be more forgivable.Main flaw with the monsters ""consistency"" is just how conveniently you don't see any, at all, for the longest time it fits for the so-so storyline at the time. In S2, they're just so uncommon, no country on earth would struggle to finish them off. S2 the monsters would struggle to compete with any small redneck US street nevermind trained Korean military.On the other hand some of the ""monsters"" they create but probably don't use brilliantly have so much potential.It gets so many things right but also fails drastically at other times. All said, even at its worst I'd still definitely recommend giving it a chance.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,It was so freaking good.badly waiting for season 2 .,positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There's a decent amount of CGI that's hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot.
One of things that's a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it's a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it's okay to consume that much time.
The monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we'd have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities.
The story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that's just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don't know, and the show doesn't end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers. I might not even watch it, answers or not.
But overall, something slightly different to watch. I thought that it was visually really good, great music/sound too! Watch this if you're bored and have nothing else to watch. 10 hours is a lot of commitment.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Enjoyable, but somewhat odd. The creatures are great, not always realistic looking. That's not what's odd. What's odd is overly long shots of people just looking or staring with no expression on their faces.Maybe it's a cultural thing but no one really seems to react to anything with fear, even curiosity. Things just happen in front of them and they just stand there staring at it. A 10-ft tall thing with elongated legs and arms and everyone just stands there going, what is that? And then as it approaches them, nobody moves they just stand there. Its it's bizarre.A lot of characters are introduced, but you start to be able to distinguish who's who and what they're doing and who's brave, who's a coward, who probably needs to be killed by the monsters, and who you're going to enjoy being killed by the one of the monsters.Another strange aspect to this series is Marlboro Man. the dude in the suits what's up with him is he infected, is he not infected, or did he just happen to be caught up in this when he was robbing somebody???I'm three episodes in and I can't tell yet.

There is too much military involved, it's just another action show, with no interesting plot, boring dialogues and characters. There are, again, some cool monsters, but that is not enough to maintain interest. If you loved the first season, skip this one. You will only be disappointed.

tt11612120,"SWEET HOME is a South Korean TV show from 2020 now available for viewing on Netflix. It's based on a 'web toon', whatever that is, and I went into it with a few reservations that were quickly blown away from the end of the first instalment. This ten-episode, hour long series explores the lives of a group of residents at a tower block who wake up one day to find the world destroyed and rampaging mutated monsters killing anyone who ventures out of doors. Even worse, some of their own are infected and in the process of becoming monsters themselves!Handsomely shot and mounted, this possesses all of the quality acting you expect from Korean cinema and television, and the realistically-drawn character portraits of people you don't always like or love but who ring true to life: the conflicted, suicidal teenager; the stroppy guitarist; the masculine firefighter; the scarred gangster with a talent for torture. Interesting character development is interspersed with outlandish action and fight scenes every episode as the dwindling characters encounter one nightmarish creation after another. The CGI effects aren't meant to be photorealistic but I grew to love them anyway as they fit the show's fantastic landscape. Twisty, turning, surprising and grisly, with a consistent quality from beginning to end, this might well be the TV show of the year.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Sweet Home stands as a gripping testament to the power of the horror genre in Korean television, weaving a tale that is equal parts heart-wrenching and terrifying. With its intricate storytelling, well-developed characters, and stunning visuals, the series takes us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions while exploring the very essence of humanity in the face of monstrous adversity.Explores the complexities of human nature under extreme circumstances. The narrative unfolds as reclusive loner Cha Hyun-soo, portrayed with remarkable depth by Song Kang, finds himself thrust into a nightmarish scenario when his apartment complex turns into a breeding ground for monstrous creatures. From the outset, the series establishes a foreboding atmosphere, intensified by the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that expertly complements the unfolding horror.Huge commitment to character development. As the residents of the apartment complex grapple with their worst fears manifesting into grotesque creatures, the series meticulously explores the humanity that persists within them. Each character is meticulously crafted, revealing layers of vulnerability, resilience, and darkness. Song Kang's portrayal of Cha Hyun-soo is a revelation, as he seamlessly transitions from a tormented soul to a reluctant hero, carrying the emotional weight of the narrative on his shoulders.The monsters aren't just physical entities; they are embodiments of the characters' inner demons. The creature design is both nightmarish and imaginative, adding a unique flavor to the horror genre. The CGI and practical effects are executed with such finesse that the monsters become an integral part of the narrative, heightening the stakes and intensifying the terror.The pacing of the series is commendable, balancing moments of intense horror with poignant character interactions. It doesn't rely solely on jump scares; instead, it crafts an atmosphere of dread that lingers, making every moment fraught with tension. The series isn't afraid to delve into psychological horror, exploring the darkest corners of the human mind as characters grapple with the consequences of their choices in the face of annihilation.Sweet Home also excels in its thematic exploration of survival and the blurred lines between humanity and monstrosity. It poses thought-provoking questions about the lengths individuals are willing to go to in order to survive, and the sacrifices they make along the way. The moral ambiguity of certain characters adds layers of complexity, making it challenging for us to pass easy judgments.Visually, the series is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the eerie beauty of the decaying apartment complex and the gruesome transformations of its inhabitants. The juxtaposition of moments of quiet despair with frenetic action sequences creates a dynamic viewing experience.The series doesn't shy away from addressing societal issues either. Amidst the horror, it explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the resilience of the human spirit. It reflects the anxieties of the real world through its fictional narrative, making it a socially relevant piece of storytelling.This one is a triumph in the horror genre, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in Korean television. It weaves a narrative that is as emotionally resonant as it is terrifying, with stellar performances, masterful storytelling, and a visual aesthetic that leaves a lasting impression. For those seeking a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche in the face of unimaginable horrors, Sweet Home is a must-watch that transcends the confines of its genre.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The settings, the costumes, the music, the performances, everything is and feels perfect, as the group of residence is trying to survive.

Still, this season sets strong foundations for those to come.In addition, everything is well constructed, with enough screen time for each character and each storyline.

tt11612120,"The first season was pretty cool, it wasn't my favorite show by any means and i thought it had a lot of problems as far as just kinda odd cartoonish character moments, but thats the thing is some of its best moments could have been described that way too, but when that applied to the drama rather than the action and horror, it took me out of certain moments, where things just seemed a bit childish and melodramatic. Darkness for its own sake. Still, i thought it had a unique world and i like the weird noticeable CG monsters that don't try to hard to look perfectly real, i find them more visually interesting than monsters in plenty of other series or movies i'd consider better overall. So season 1 got a 6 from me, and im a rather harsh reviewer. Season 2 however, went down the drain VERY quickly. I can't even describe how much happened in this season that i didn't care about. I made it through 3-4 episodes because there were some interesting monsters that held my interest and a few interesting moments with main characters. Around there i realized there was suddenly just a LOT going on that i did not care about at all, and i just felt i had to skip some scenes to get through, it was all these military guys just being dicks to eachother, very boring. I basically fast forwarded through the last half and the end seemed frankly stupid to me. Other reviews i checked out agreed that this was mostly just chaotic pointless filler, its wild to me they filmed a whole other season already as well, because this is BAD. Skip this one.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"First of all, I want to say, both the ""perfect"" reviews and the ""abysmal"" reviews both miss the mark. This show is a great ""middle-of-the-road"" experience. It's concepts are great, and in the same breath, the writing is terrible in a way that is really entertaining to tease poking fun. The effects are awesome while the characters are hilariously aching anime/manga clichés. Great emotion with wafer-thin development, and so on and so forth. I would recommend you check it out, but go in with an attitude that this isn't one of those Netflix masterpiece offerings or absolute trash despite how much people want it to be one or the other.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"I read the webcomic as it came out, and have loved it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a Netflix adaptation, I was skeptical, but excited to see what they decide to do with it. If you're like me, you'll know that they changed a lot of things, drastically. The first complaint I have is how little we get to see Hyun. I feel like the comic focused on him a whole lot more, and we also got to see his 'monster' way more frequently. The adaptation should've more on him than the rest of the group. On the other hand, I can see that if they focus on the group more, then it would strengthen the fact that Hyun is a loner, but I don't exactly like that. The ending drastically changed, and I think it's a hit or miss for most people. They added in the military and so many more things, but I liked the simplicity of the comic. Also, the girl with the character development (the one who fell to her death at the end) isn't here, and it seems like she was replaced with another guy. Old man didn't get crushed by protein monster (that was huge in the comic, I'm surprised they didn't include that) and I think the romance is kinda bad. The woman and her dead child made me cry though, so I liked how they wrote her. Overall, I'm uncertain where they'll take this, but I'll keep my hopes up for now.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Non stop action, monsters, drama, and gore! This is a wonderful example of Korean creativeness and how far TV shows have come. I am starting to become a fan of Korean acting, especially in Sweet Home, where everyone has a story that slowly unfolds with each episode and nobody are who they seem. The makeup is great with realistic scenes and the monsters CGI are a blend of new animation and classic effects. The latter episodes include a few more emotions and tears but the entertainment is still there -- you can't have all action and no back story for the entire season. All in all I really enjoyed it.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

The acting and characters weren't bad, although there were very cliché. If they had some money, I hope they'd change the cgi and music. The music choices were awful.

Season 2 is like a garbage piling in our rooms but we are just not throwing it out and just watching it or ignoring it.Honestly saying Season 2 was rubbish, Very bad in storytelling, Please dont ask me about characters because for them there are only bad/cursed words in my mouth, talking about mail lead(one wing man) I want to say that just what is his character he has power but dont use it, keep standing and crying and literally do the foolishest things you and I will do if we get those powers. Frankly saying I was waiting the whole second season to watch him do something, my mind was saying that now is the time when he will make a god-like entry but I was foolish to think that I can expect anything good from NETFLIX and finally talking about female leadssssssssss(Sorry my mouth is getting out of control.....BAD WORDS INCOMING....)

Too less shown of strong female characters of a real fighting with monsters. It was toooooo slow with action time . Just the army members fighting . Where are the people like on season one ? And lastly ... what's wrong with Cha hyun su screen time ? It was going fine in the beginning but then he disappeared for like 2-3 episodes not showing him at all. He has just a few lines and went from the special monster to a one of them and not even the strongest one as he should have been . The young girl took his place as now she is the biggest special one . I had hopes but I don't know how S3 is going to be . I only enjoyed the last episode of the whole new season, when finally the lead actor are on screen .

I can imagine that if i haven't read the webtoon, I wouldn't finish the first episode. Bad CGI (the monsters are not scary at all and more like stop motion dolls), very bad acting and directing.

It's basically an entirely new show with a plethora of new characters with no background or development to them the few remaining characters from the first season are either dead or not a focal point, of the main plot which becomes focused on chaos and an autocratic military government and ""civilian"" morons most of whom totally new as I mentioned.I'd personally stop watching by the end of one though it leaves on somewhat of a cliffhanger that basically crashes.Season 2 the episodes are not only fragmented without character development they are 20-30 minutes longer than season 1.I advise this for nearly all programs good or bad to watch in the native language (Korean) and the subtitles.

tt11612120,"Man, this show was something, I definitely recommend it to every horror fan out there. It's a fresh take on the tired zombie-siege formula with a great set of characters, great performances ans most importantly fantastic monster designs used in creative set-pieces.If I would have rated this after the first 3 episodes, this would have been an easy 9, unfortunately the show can't keep the pace and sharp writing of it's opening up and deflates to an extend. The best monsters and set-pieces are delivered up-front, while we are getting more character focuses later on. This by itself wouldn't have been bad, since the human stories are good ones and the investment in the peoples fates is definitely there, but the show really struggles to move the plot along after things settle. The writers really struggle to give people something to do and random side quests pop-up that are almost immediately dropped after an anti-climatic resolution. There is also a weird editing structure at place I never got used to, where the show would give us flashbacks to past conversations or basically extended versions of prior scenes where something was said or done, that only becomes immediately relevant after the flashback. There seems to be no faith in the audience to keep track of character motivations and relationships over multiple episodes.
Also rules are very inconsistent, first it's a big deal that monsters can't be killed, plenty of monsters are killed. Wearing headphones should alert you to monsters presence, people with headphones get jumped by monsters all the time and so on...Lastly, it becomes a pity party quite often, I was worried the besieged apartment building would sink in the lake of tears generated by the people trapped inside. It is standard for Asian cinema, but still a bit too much some times.That sound overly negative, but make no mistakes, the show is good overall, you come for the monsters, you stay for the survivors. The creature design is great throughout, the CGI holds up most of the time (whit a couple of bad shots, mainly involving a hulking monstrosity) and the practical effects are top notch like the overall production value. If we get a second season I hope the overall plot is paced much better and the emotions will be dialed back a bit",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"Updated review after finishing watching season 2. I thought it was one of the saddest yet beautiful shows I've ever watched, there was a lot of tear jerking moments for me and I'm not someone who gets emotional often. The story is basically people are turning into random monsters and follow a group of survivors in an apartment building. I would say it falls under horror but there is some light humour thrown in as well. There is good deal of drama in the mix, a couple of times I did actually cry something I don't do often. It is very well acted the story is great so far and there is a good balance of action and character building. I recommend watching with the original Korean voice with English subtitles, I tried to watch it with English voice overs but it just wasn't as good. The one negative i have is on the most part the effects are good but the CGI is great in places and then terrible in others. But I can't recommend this enough, now that being said season 2 just seems to be lacking something, I'm assuming it written by a different team because it just isn't as good it seems to swing more towards intense action with monster in it. They kill off characters we came to enjoy in the first season because you know why not? And introduce a bunch of new characters that take up the majority of the screen time after the first 3 episodes, im assuming they did this to speed up production, but it just takes the focus away from the characters that they have built a good amount of character development up with, (the few that are left from season 1) It's still some what enjoyable however I just feel the writing has let it down hopefully it will pick up in season 3.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

And as is usual with Netflix, the dubbing is really bad.

tt11612120,Season one was one of the most creative horror shows going. You never knew what the next monster would be and each one was unique based on the whole monsterization curse.Everything a new one showed up itnwas exciting to see what it could do.All of the characters where well thought out and you got a good sense of who they where as it went on.Season 2 is not bad but feels like a completely different show. The first part follows the original group and is really tense even has a shock moment. All leading up to the frankly epic stadium moment.Then it jumps forwardHalf the original characters are gone and apart from a couple of standouts the monsters have all become generic CGI blobs.One scene with the army group fighting a horde with cut and paste versions if the same monster took everything away from the unquie ideas.It mostly revolves around said army groups squabbles and chest beating.

tt11612120,"OK, I am going to start by saying that I'm a huge horror fan so this series really caught my attention. From start to finish it was a Rollercoaster of creepiness, scares, emotions and awesome character development. Never got boring for even a second and the monsters are really cool and deep if you are paying good attention to the story. Most monsters in horror movies don't even make much sense but in this series it does make sense. Because I got pretty tired of horror movies with the classic its just a bunch of meaningless jumpscares and enemies that are just there to fill the plot. No more blubbering. Go watch this series right now and you won't regret it. Excited for season 2 and what is has to offer! (Also I had to give it 9/10, - 1 because of some fight scenes being a little rushed. But still, a series definitely worth watching!)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"I was so impressed with the first couple of episodes!
Didn't expect anything and loved the wierd, quirky residents of the building. And then the monster came - and man are they awesome!! Totally could see it as a video game ala Resident Evil or Silent Hill.
BUT around half way through it felt like they had fired all their good shots - less monsters, and mainly people sitting around /talking /crying or fighting each other. (maybe they were out of budget?!)
10* for the first half and 5-6* for the second.All together still very watchable",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"I had second thoughts about starting it but after the first two episodes it just got better and better. I do think that Asian horror series and movies are kind of too much about their ""horror scenes"" but this isn't the case here. Although it has some scenes to prove its theme there isn't much attention paid to them. I really liked the plot and I loved the different details and personas of every character. The whole series is fascinating and keeps you on edge all the time. It's like every episode ends with a cliffhanger. The background stories of the characters are very interesting and I liked how the series although it has a dark theme it pays much attention to the relationships and emotions among humans. I would really recommend it to anyone who likes horror-action series.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"This show caught me immediately when I watched the first season a few years ago. I found the concept unique and fascinating, and the focus on a tight knit community and their personal struggles gave each encounter with the mysterious horrors they were facing a sense of weight and gravitas. These initial episodes were beautifully paced, giving each character's personality time to shine, and giving plenty of moments of heartfelt levity to balance the brutality. Throughout the course of the season, I grew to know each of the characters and care about what happened to them. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about season 2, and even rewatched all of season 1 when it came out, in order to refresh my memory. The shift in tone between seasons was immediately evident. Gone was the thoughtful, character-centric storytelling, in favor of over the top action sequences full of bland monsters, countless non descript soldiers with big guns and flame throwers, car chases that would be at home in a Vin Deisel movie, and plenty of uninteresting new characters that never show much more personality than a wet paper sack.Even the season 1 characters lost their personality this season. There was nothing to distinguish them from the faceless mobs around them, and no moment to breathe with them and get to know them on a deeper level. It was simply a rush from one disaster to another, with nothing in between except some screaming and sobbing. Even when they killed off some of my favorite characters in cheap and unsatisfying ways, I found that I didn't really feel anything. They just didn't even seem like the same people I had gotten to know in the first season.I really wanted to like season 2. I tried very hard to. The storytelling was simply half baked and didn't give the audience a chance to connect with the charcters before sending them into disaster after disaster. Season 1 seemed to grasp that the bad stuff hits way harder when there's some good stuff and human connection mixed in. I wish the writers of Season 2 had picked up on that, and I really hope that Season 3 fixes that mistake.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"I watched this on Netflix with subtitles and the original dialogue. I can't comment on dubbing other than don't use it for anything, ever.It's an interesting take on the zombie/monster genre. But if you get interested by the first few episodes you might later regret feeling the need to stick through and see how it ends. By the last few episodes I was losing interest. Several characters are intolerable. Some likable characters are sidelined. Some events are over the top to the point that it's frustrating. It sometimes goes too far on pointless shock value, and other times not far enough. It's not a terrible show if you're looking for monster/horror/apocalypse/survival, but I found it getting old by the end.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"*First*
Most of reviews here do not do justice to this show. The story is great, the character development is also compelling and really amazing CGI and visual effects.*Second*
Story is gripping and it's a roller coaster ride. This show will make you go through lots of emotions. This show gives me the anime *Parasyte* vibe.*Third*
Give this show a chance and watch it all the way it's a great one. Not in a single episode it felt like the show was dragging or was adding unnecessary fillers or anything unrelated to the story.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"The idea of this series is great. Instead of zombies you get people turning into these crazy monsters. First seven episodes are survival horror and the last 3 are straight up Game of Thrones/Walking Dead if you know what I mean. It just gets dark, gruesome and sad really quick.What I liked the most about this series is that it isn't the usual stuff. It's like a mix of 21 days later, meets resident evil, meets the last of us meets Marvel comics. It has a lot of good themes going for it that makes it worth watching if any of the above appeal to you.I will say that watching this it seemed like a single season was good enough. I'm not sure how adding a season 2 would go with so many good characters now gone. At least for me everybody I liked was dead at the end so there was no point to watching the story further. I guess it really did hit a walking dead point.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"As a Webtoon long time fan, I just had to watch this, and I can say, I am not disappointed. Characters are just amazing, great representation of human interaction in specific horrifying circumstances, lovely depiction of fight from average, normal people you could likely meet anywhere, great action, fun, there is also a lot of humor, and the story is just amazing. It has horror, sf and comedy elements, but it also has deeper meaning, much more than surface deep horror, it makes you think. There is no some superficial glamour, no model like characters, but humans you can relate to and like. Story is quite interesting and has deeper layers than it looks on first sight. Granted, CGI effects are not much, as production does not seem expensive, but I still loved it, because all CGI is in function of the story, not just to shock you.Also, soundtrack is getting great along with the story.I would recommend it, and I am waiting for second season!Update: don't watch the second season, it just ruins the first one. First one is 10, second is like 3. Not good. Could be completely different series like spin-off, but then I wouldn't watch it.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"First of all, watch it with subtitles because dubbing is terrible and original language is always best. I watched the first episode because I got bored and love these types of shows, then found myself 5 episodes in and really liking it. I would rate the first half of this show a high 8/10 even with some sketchy CGI and over acting. The second half starts to go down hill and gets very long winded with far less monsters and gore and more long, drawn out drama. By the end, it's more drama than anything. So I would rate the second half more of a 5 or 6/10. The premise is that people are turning into all sorts of monsters....no monster ever the same and at first there is no known cause for it. This show follows the survivors and monsters stuck in a very large apartment building. As the show moves on, you realize it's not an infectious disease like with zombies, but I won't say more. The CGI is sometimes great, then goes totally flat and looks absolutely horrible. Overall, this is a very enjoyable show to watch with a very unique premise behind it. I look forward to season 2 should they make one.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"Starts off well, and falls apart very quickly. The beginning was very well paced and even the CGI was pretty good. Then after a couple promising episodes in the show stops making sense and becomes a string of random plot lines and awkward emotional scenes where characters just stare at each other and cry, most of the time for no reason other than to kill time (this could have been 4 or 5 episodes instead, with fewer characters).
Eventually character development and motivations just fall apart and it becomes a mystery why anything happens or any character does anything.
Also a lot of seemingly important things happen that are never addressed again.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"

tt11612120,"I found this series through the manhua based on it and was shocked when I found out that it was produced and created, I didn't expect something like Sweet Home to get a Live Action release when not even an animation of it had been done.And I like it, shockingly enough.Usually Live Action adaptions of works in manga/manhua/comic/book form these days I have a visceral dislike for as they're usually terrible, but this adapts part of the story well.Lets get to the deets tho, the actors are fine, they're usually as believable as possible for what they are playing though some of it comes across as a little hammy to my uncultured Western ears, it might be decent for Korean TV/Movies but I wouldn't know, this is literally the first piece of Live Action Korean cinema I've seen and like I said I like it. (well except for some of the portrayals, that woman clearly going crazy with the virus at the start giving the poor guard the rotten fish annoyed me to no end)Now we get to a little bit of the problems though.The series doesn't give time to let things breathe, the way things go in the series it's a VERY fast ride through the plot from beginning to end and in that quickness, there's a lack of needed connection for certain characters, leaving emotional deaths to be less than thrilling and the eventual end to be kind of anticlimactic.I would love to see more of this universe even though the manhua as (as far as I know) finished.In itself, it's a fun little zombie movie with some original ideas, while they're zombies they are also strange monsters too depending on who/what they were before they were infected. That's what drew me to the series in the first place and it's a fantastic story to see more of.All in all the only reason this isn't 10/10 is that quick rush to the end. If they'd let the story build a bit more, have the heroes at a half way point and let this move into a season 2 I think it would be a perfect series.But aside from that, it's fantastic.As always (without very few notable exceptions) the netflix dub is atrocious and I suggest watching this on original language with subs if you don't speak Korean, the VA's in it are terrible in English and like most things these days dubbed into English, I avoid that like the plague.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"
tt11612120,"As a sweet home fan since literally the start of season 1 i was so disappointed watching season 2, the plot completely went off the rails after episode 3 and so many main characters from season 1 were killed off like they were nothing. First of all the dude from season 1 that turned into a monster on the bus in season 2 that killed the girl, that was honestly the start of the downfall as they gave character to season 1 and were killed off in season 2 like they were nothing. And don't get me started on Ji-su who was unrightfully killed in episode 3, not even to a monster but some rocks, she was one of the best characters too and practically made ""sweet home"" but died like a side character. Also, the plot was basically just filled with new irrelevant characters and overruled by the military. They also gave the MAIN character hyun-soo, who is literally on their poster, less screen time than some of the military men. And the season 2 monsters cannot even compare to the a season 1 monsters, the s2 monsters were shown with practically zombie characteristics whereas in season 1, basically every of the monsters had a storyline as to how they became a monster and what their desire was. Talking about ji-soo again (can you see my frustration) she and the other OG characters who carried the whole of season 1 were killed so fast when they developed so much depth into season 1. And to finish off my rant, the plot was horrible i'm sorry but half of the time i didn't even know what was going on because all that it was, was talking about military and that's about all i got from it, at one point i thought i was watching a war movie. Unless they bring back ji-soo somehow because of the fact that her body was never really shown, i don't see how sweet home season 3 can pull through and impress me like season 1 did.

tt11612120,"The first few episodes of the show had me completely invested in it. From episode 7 onwards, it lost me. The writing is just too inconsistent. Far too much time is spent on characters introspection, and not enough spent reinforcing the world the writers are trying to build.I Googled a few questions I had about the show and came across post after post - from those who have read the web comic - lamenting the fact that certain information wasn't included in the show, and questioning why background information was included. I have to agree with them. Far too much time is spent showing us flashbacks. We don't need ""origin"" stories as the characters are already in a dire situation that's going to change their personality going forward. What we need are explanations of why certain events are happening now, why certain monsters seemingly appear from nowhere and a bit more time spent showing us character interactions in the here-and-now.The soundtrack is good.

Season 2 went completely sideways. Nothing really related to season 1 mostly soldiers and people I haven't seen in season 1 and very few things that kept me interested. I had a hard time watching the 8 episodes of season 2 as it was really that bad. Season 1 on the other hand I was able to binge watch it in 2 days.

He's been beaten up, shot, poisoned, kidnapped, hit by a car, put in jail for a month on false murder charges, wrongly divorced, lied on and maligned, framed for murder, framed for corruption, demoted at work, humiliated and fired from his job...what more can they throw at this man?The main family -- how stupid are they? Do they know how to put up a valid argument? After they had been locked out of their own home, after getting it back, they tell the person who kicked them out and stole their money and company to leave and she simply says, ""you can't make me leave, I'm a resident here,"" but she was able to put them out of their own house without warning? Please. What really irritates me are shows where the villian gets away with literally everything and they are completely unstoppable. And as Hae-in goes in for surgery that will erase her memory, not one person said, ""let's make a bunch of videos so you can remember us and your life when you wake up!"" Noooo, she writes notes in a journal that the bad guy simply burns.There are so many stupid or unrealistic moments thst i can't list them all.

tt27668559,"To get the good parts out of the way first, I must say that the acting was great, especially when it comes to Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won, but not only. They all delivered top notch performances.Besides that, the OSTs were so beautiful, the cinematography was gorgeous, the sets were beautifully built and the costumes were always magnificent, especially when it comes to the female lead.That being said, I now want to talk about the parts that I consider to be not so great: the plot, the story and the villain.Storywise, the first half was well done. We got to know the characters, their personalities and their beliefs, we got to know the situation they're in and what they want to achieve and we got to see the villain and his accomplices' work being done slowly but steadily, which created the anticipation that was needed for the midpoint of the series.Because of the great twist, the 2nd half was promising but it fell short. The characters changed, yes, but those changes weren't enough to overcome the power of the villains. The rich familly got closer and learned how to love each other more, but they remained just as unintelligent as in the first half.More than that, the second half was way too much abut the villains. It felt that the main leads were playing a secondary role in their show. They started to be so passive and just react at the changes the villain was making.Plotwise, the series started losing its charm in the second half as well. The amount of scenes that felt repetitive and the back and forth between the main leads only showed the lack of creativity of the writer.But the thing that annoyed me the most was that some things happened just because. No set-up beforehand, no nothing, they just happened.Let's take Hae-In as an example here, she had one wish up until episode 13 and she wanted to fulfill her wish no matter what, but when she got the opportunity to satisfy it she immediately turned it down. Her perspective and wish changed in a fraction of a second, and the reason for that was something that was not true to her character for the last 13 episodes. It was a decision that just popped up and set up episode 14 to be the biggest back and forth between the main leads in the entire series.Finally, the villain. They tried so hard to make a memorable villain, that people would talk about, that they started to lose the identity of the show. They invested so much screen time in his character that the theme of the series started to lose it's spark.I respect the fact that he had a scope, that drove his actions the entire time, but at the same time I hate that he was built that strong.He was the type of villain that had everything: money, power, connections, everything. He was invincible. He appeared everywhere at every time. He was just too strong to feel real.He had his weak point, yes, but it wasn't something so important since he always recovered in a heartbeat when he was hit by others.This was my point of view and I hope you'd respect it.I would recommend this series mainly because of it's cast, but no other than that.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Beautiful to look and a great start to the series with funny dialogue and tragic scenarios leading up to everyone's present. My anticipation racheted up after the first couple episodes.However, if I had one problem with the story, it was that the leads didn't have nearly enough screentime together not spent fighting evil. I waited patiently episode after episode for quiet scenes spent in comfort with the leads getting reacquainted emotionally but the end of the day, we didn't even get a hug in the final moments of their happily-ever-after.

Anyway, as a fan of Kim Soo Hyun, he never repeats a role. At first, I got bored with his comeback drama, but after watching the first episode, I started to love his role as a husband. I also started to love Kim Ji-won as an actress. I hated her during The Heirs. 😆 I could say that both of them have come so far. Going back to the drama, the story is not the typical love story. It's more about the feelings after marriage. As a married woman who had a failed marriage, you can feel the love between the couple that was hidden because of emotional exhaustion.

There's always some ridiculous drama going on, and just as they're about to figure it out, there's another drama. So, in my opinion, this show is not a show that deserves 8 points, it is a score given just because the main characters and their short romantic scenes are beautiful. Apart from the plot of the series, the locations, clothes etc. Are nice. The show was a scenario as if scriptwriters were forced to continue the series and they had no more topics to write. I watch it on Netflix and new episodes are released every week. It's not a good enough series to make it worth waiting for a new episode every week.

tt27668559,"To start with the strong points of this drama the cast is as stellar as it gets. Also there is the visually perfect lead couple of Kim Ji Won and Kim Soo Hyun. The camera focuses on their faces and perfect hair and skin a lot. Sometimes it's like an extended photo shoot for them. Kim Ji Won looks stunningly beautiful. Her face has always been very pretty but here she is shown at her most glamorous. Her hair and skin and makeup and wardrobe are perfect.The story was weak. It was an impossible task for the writer to live up to Crash Landing with the scope and grandeur of CLOY. I didn't expect it to be as good given the subject matter but even then this story was disappointingly thin and weak and not well structured. Terminal illness and memory loss are so overdone in the K drama universe. There wasn't enough story and there were repetitive scenes and predictable plot lines. The villains mother and son were not that well written and were one dimensional. Although it is great veteran actress Lee Mi Sook got a big role as the evil mistress. There are greedy mistresses out there and she did a great job. Park Sung Hoon the villain from the Glory is good at acting evil but his love for her seemed so unconvincing. The colonel's wife and rat from CLOY are a watchable and amusing secondary romance. There are some funny parts when he hides his divorce intentions in the beginning and later contrasting the conglomerate family and the village family. Kwak Dong Yeon brings some comic relief. This great cast couldn't save the weak material. The ending felt like a whimper and the shootout was so cliched. In the shoulder like CLOY?As for the locations, it is great they filmed overseas again. But Berlin and Sans Souci aren't the most magical places they could have chosen. Rather grim compared to this writer's previous overseas locales. I get she wanted to get treatment in Germany but couldn't they have picked a prettier place?It's sad this series wasn't better after such a long wait. I was actually bored quite often. I have seen way better makjang and family dramas. Maybe the episodes were too long.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"They made a mistake when they changed the direction of this story. It started off being about how a man who married into a superbly wealthy family was fed up with being taken advantage of and mistreated and was about to call it quits when he realizes that he can't (and maybe also deep down doesn't want to). Then, the story should have explored everything that it would have taken for this man and woman to get their marriage back on track and for their families to reconcile and accept each other the way they never had before. That sounds like a unique story with a lot of material.Instead, the story veers into very tired, overwrought territory filled with clichés: secret funds stashed abroad, villains under your roof, the hero that appears at always the right moment, the OTP whose paths intersected in the past when they were children and later again as teens, and more...oh boy! We also lose the actually funny humor of the early episodes to attempts at humor in the later episodes that are just embarrassing.There are also way too many lengthy scenes of people crying. Can someone please explain to me how anyone finds it entertaining to watch someone cry...cry some more...then cry again? I wish creators of K-dramas would get it into their heads that this is not entertaining. Keep the crying scenes short and to a minimum please!On the plus side, the music is very pretty.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

The story in the beginning is a gem, as it progressed it was predictable and frustrating. The one thing which saved this show and made me rate it so high was the acting, an absolute delight. It reminded me of the emotional intensity when I first watched CLOY, which I'm grateful that I could feel it again. I actually sobbed again which is a testament to how good some scenes actually are.Do give it a try, it can be frustrating and stupid at times but surely watching the acting would flutter your heart.

There are some hidden feelings ( which makes the storyline interesting).To be honest, if you are experiencing a slump in kdramas, then this is the drama which will help enjoy to the fullest.

It's your typical heavy romantic drama with over-the-top antagonists. Whatever's going on, it'll also make you realize a lot of things.The finale was a bit underwhelming for me though... I could've been more satisfied to see more happy scenes of hyun-woo and hae-in together.

tt27668559,"Queen of Tears captivates with its stellar cast, who deliver strong performances throughout the show. The series boasts a visually appealing aesthetic, with designed outfits and stylish sets. However, the narrative falters in the later episodes. It leans heavily on familiar k-drama, and the plot feels drawn-out, making it predictable with cliché injured/ coma scenes. I skipped scenes in the last few episodes.While the show aspires to be a tearjerker, it doesn't quite have the same emotional response compared to dramas like ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" or ""Crash Landing on You."" These dramas deliver a more compelling emotional journey, with a perfect blend of humor (CLOY specifically) and heartfelt moments.I believe the hype of the show is more because of the writer and popularity of Kim Soo-Hyun.

It captivates you from the very first episode.What fascinated me in this series is the unpredictability of the characters! Not every character is what they seem at first glance, and you'll be surprised when their true personalities are somewhat revealed.Always in Korean dramas we see the whole series until the couple gets married, we all are happy to see them get married and we think that their story will always go well but this series will prove to you that it is not. In my opinion, the main obstacles start in relationships after marriage and this series shows this very well.And the star of this series for me is Kim Ji Won, I love her from the drama ""Fight for My Way"".

tt27668559,"I love Kim Soo-Hyun he is the reason I fell in love with KDramas. I also like Kim Jin-Won she is a very talented actor(My liberation notes)she was outstanding in that. So I was eagerly waiting on this drama ever since it was announced. The premise of the show was intriguing enough. But it's a Kdrama after all so it was always going to be cliche. So this was nothing original or outstanding in terms of the plot. It was very much predictable to be honest as the show went further.With a strong cast from the leads to the supporting cast the show did deliver with strong performances. You really feel hatred towards the villians,what lets this show down is the lack of screen time of the leads together. The plot had made it sound as if we would really experience a love so deep between the leads. I wanted the moments they share together to be powerful and memorable.So much time was wasted on unnecessary soapy dramatic scenes. The plot focused too much on their enemies. Maybe I was expecting a love story so I got disappointed. Never the less the biggest issue like with many Kdramas is too many episodes. Each episode had a run time of around 120min with finale 145min. So why did it need 16 episodes? I honestly got bored after episode 12. To the point of skipping through episodes 14 &15. And i didn't miss much,filler episodes in Kdramas are so unnecessary. It simply becomes a bore as everything is just repeating and pointless characters getting screen time.But I will give this drama an A plus for a good conclusion. Sadly it should've have ended around episode 12. So this could've been a classic had they spend more time on the main characters love story. It should've been as good as Crash Landing on you and It's okay not to be okay. But it just falls short from those outstanding dramas.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Kim Soohyun and Kim Jiwon are so very talented and they are the best part about the countless sad scenes, because you get to see their acting, which is exceptional. They're really good at portraying full emotions with their eyes and you will find yourself crying with them in every scene.Here's the thing, the writers have tried so hard to give the audience plotwist after plotwist that they kinda loose the actual direction of the drama. It started as a romcom but right now I feel like watching ""Starway to heaven"" all over again (yes, it's that painful) and do not take this as a compliment at all. This show have had me stressed over weeks! It's unbearable to watch the leads go through that much. Almost dying, going to jail, losing their memories, constantly being manipulated??? Like what the hell is going on? The villain keeps winning and even if at the end he dies or whatever, it won't still make up for the amount of damage he has caused to Haein and Hyunwoo for both their personal lives and their relationship.It would not pissed me off this much if this show wasn't labeled as a romcom, and when you see the trailer you expect something so different. This is a full drama with thriller nuances.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Even though some of the people are over exaggerated stereotypes, the main couple are such good characters, and the development in both them and the others are really worth the watch. I'm hoping for a happy ending, but I'm also prepared for the opposite.

Sure, some of the plot is predictable, but it still had me sobbing and binge-watching till the wee hours of the morning.The cast is phenomenal and their performance carried the story through its weaker points, especially some of the side characters who add some much needed humor and have solid development. It's beautiful to see the whole extended family reconcile and change.BUT: Amnesia is the Worst. Plot. Device. Ever.I hate it. No hospital would allow a vulnerable memory-loss patient's care to be commandeered in that manner. It derailed the whole story. Yoon Eun-seong is such a creepy and manipulative villain.The last few epispdes also fell apart because it became more and more desperately dramatic and ridiculous, particularly with serious injuries being disregarded. The main couple needed more exploration of the past conflict in their marriage and then subsequent reconciliation of those conflicts.

I had been watching patiently week by week, hoping the writing would improve, but it didn't. It mixed up everything: divorce, a mean mother-in-law, cancer, memory loss, etc.-you name it. I thought the writer was being creative in offering something new because people said the writer was a big deal. However, it turns out the writing is just like a story created by a middle-schooler on Wattpad.I know for sure this drama will be successful in terms of viewership since the writer went back to basics by having good-looking casts and glamorous styles. This recipe guarantees ratings. But, it makes the work look cheap.

tt27668559,"The fist half of the series had such a flaw it was hard to care about the main characters. When Hyun-Woo learns Hae-In is terminally ill his reaction is borderline heartless. To avoid Hyun-Woo looking heartless the show should have done more to show how horribly mistreated he was by Hae-In. Even if the show did that Hae-In would need to have been downright mentally or physically abusive for Hyun-Woo to be as passive as he is about her illness early in the show.It's just not believable that if deep down he loved her he wouldn't be immediately crushed and sympathetic unpon learning of her diagnosis. Instead he and his lawyer friend almost joke about it and how he can hold on to try and get her to change her will. Later, Hae-In learns this and is ""mad"" but such horribly callous behavior would be unforgivable.The horrible way Hyun-Woo reacts early makes the transformation in later episodes not believable.Also the way Hae-In reacts to the her own diagnosis is also not believable. She cares more about the trillion dollar club than the fact she has six months to live.These flaws undermine the second half of the show and more emotional moments.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

tt27668559,"Edit, after watching 16 episodes:
Still a 6 from me. What might have been a beautiful series, was lost in so many other storylines. Wish it had been more about the marriagestruggles and love, and lighthearted and funny moments, and less about the secret money, shareholders, company struggles, the villain mom/son duo etc.Original:
Was looking forward to this show, but for me, it is a huge let down.Have watched 14 episodes, but I am sooo bored. This evenings Ep 14 got me super annoyed, and I turned it off with a few minutes left. The main plot in this episode is enough, we do not need the bad guy there as well. AND, you know how this episode is going to end, because of what the evidence the Korean police find(trying not to spoil anything here).The ML is very stiff(«plastic»-like), and the FL is either hot/cold, but does a good job.The Bad Guy(in the love triangle) is very unlikable, as he should be.I only wrote this review because of ep 14. Before this, I rated the show 8, but it had gone downhill, and is a 6 for me now. The two last episodes must be something very special for me to change my mind.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I don't get the hype. Really. It was just ok at best. Not many likable characters. The Hong family redeemed themselves after they lost everything and began to cherish family more. I thought that was nice. The villain was laughably obsessed over the main girl. His motives lacked consistency. I wasn't convinced if it was really money or Hae-In's love he actually wanted. I thought the leads did a good job acting overall but hated their marriage relationship. The writers could've done a better job at what led to their fall out. You could clearly tell they were so in love before in the flashbacks but acted like it was their first time with everything which was strange. Alot of their issues could be solved if they tried to communicate and they really had little to no skills. But what is a Kdrama without misunderstandings? Kdramas need to do a better job at portraying hospital settings too. It doesn't make sense that anyone can just waltz in to a hospital and claim they're someone's guardian-especially someone who is of high profile. It had some funny and interesting parts here and there but by the end, it just became outrageous with the stuff they were pulling to keep viewers watching. This show is a total makjang as they call it.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

tt27668559,"This Kdrama is carefully planned and packed with unexpected twists and turns and unbelievably cute and funny dialogues. It shows titillating love lines and scenes and dialogues that make me tear up and those that make me burst into laughter.The lead actress, Kim Ji Won, is outstanding and right on point in portraying the strong-willed female boss and yet fragile character. As usual, the lead actor, Kim Soo Hyun, also shines in his quirky role.This drama writer always reminds us that there are good sides to everyone and that even villains have a purpose. For example, the main villain has been in love with the heroine since childhood and even protected her from a mad dog attacking her at his orphanage (by poisoning the dog-which foreshadows the sinister way he behaves as an adult). Many of his sidekicks are from the same orphanage, which explains why he joined hands with them.Humanism and doing the right thing are also in the background in this drama. The scenes where the rich in-laws take refuge with the poor in-laws is a little boring but provide a setting where they get closer on the personal level without the boundaries of money.I can't wait for the next episodes.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

And although the show can be slow at times, this builds up nicely the anticipation of what happens next. This is why I can't wait until a new episode is released.

Writer Park Ji Eun once again made another interesting story for us. If you're tired of watching kdramas that bores you even before it get's to the 2nd half, trust me Queen of Tears is different. Every week is a new roller coaster of emotions & twists. But it does not go out of hand it will always bring you back to it's maim message. After 3 years, Kim Soohyun is back and sure he never disappoints with his drama choices, Baek Hyunwoo is just perfect for him, we all know he made his name because of his exemplar acting skills but everytime he's on another role he still surprises me with his acting and delivery, combined with the likes of actress Kim Jiwon who also never fails to capture our hearts with her roles. Queen of Tears will be her era, it's Kim Jiwon's time just like My Love From The Star was Kim Soohyun's era. The dynamics of every character in this drama is important no role is a waste, it's one of the power sof Park Jieuns's writing skills.It's high quality production, from props to locations, script to direction, to screenplay. 1.5hrs of every episode will not feel long because your eyes will be delighted with the qualoty of this production.As someone who has been watching kdramas for almost 20yrs, trust me on this. This drama is interesting, worth the time, and the emotions you'll end up spending every episode.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Every one was out to get them. But i suppose that is true for such rich people, every other person is ready to stab you in the back.The parents of ML were amazing. Even the father of FL is really good.I loved the story of FL brother.His love for his wife was so unreal. Who loves like that?. But it was so good to see.But mainly it was the role of Baek Hyun-woo that totally kept me hooked on. What a love.Unbelievable.Each episode had atleast one scene which you want to go back and watch again.All those scenes in Baek Hyun-woo village.... and in the girls family shooting ground as well !The Germany scenes....
Too many good scenes to recount.Too many scenes that make you want to cry.Baek Hyun-woo was a master piece.Not to forget the little scene of Song Joong-ki, I love watching him :-D he is so good too !",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,This drama is the best that happened in 2024. I've never invested in a korean drama for too long until Queen of Tears came. The pairing of Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won is lit. They nailed the character of Baek Hyun Woo and Hong Hae In. Their acting is superb along side with the other cast and the cinematography is just wow. I cried a lot more than I did in other korean drama. I realized communication is very important in every aspect of relationships especially when you are married. Don't let pride take control of your emotions. I really hope Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won will get an award for their performances here. Fighting my yuyu couple!,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Your typical rom-com filled with many cliches. However, the show is quite addicting and it quickly builds empathy and sympathy. For rom-com fans, I'm sure the show offers everything they want in a show like this. For others, this is more of a guilty pleasure. Satirical depiction of husband/wife roles in traditional Korean society is quite funny and on point. The obliviousness of the super-rich is also hilarious. Again, a strong cast with exceptional acting carries the show forward. However, there is no denying the fact that the show is way, way too long. Each episode is nearly 90 min (x 16 episodes). Because of the sheer length of each episode, you will inevitably have to sit through a lot of filler scenes in each episode. If the show was cut to 75 min per ep for 16 ep or 90 min per ep for 12 or 14 eps, this could have been a much, much better show.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"If I could only give a higher rating than a five star, then I would. I absolutely loved this k-drama right from the get-go. Words are not enough to describe how beautiful this series is. Everyone did a fantastic job in it. The casting was perfect. One of my favourites aside from the lead couple is Aunt Beomja. She is so transparent and a good judge of character. Hats off to Kim Soo Hyun for a brilliant performance in this drama. I could clearly see why he is the highest paid actor in Korea. He is beyond expectation. He is versatile. He could make you laugh, cry and fall in love with him in an instant. Kim Ji Won suited her role as well and she was perfect for it. As I was watching the first few episodes it gave me the vibe of CLOY including the OST. They were a perfect match in this series. I thought to myself, finally there is another k-drama that could beat CLOY. Among a few friends I know including myself have taken a hiatus from watching k-drama as there isn't really good ones out there anymore until Queen of Tears. I watched this drama not realising it was not complete yet i.e. Missing episodes 15 and 16. Since it was so good, I watched it again from the start while waiting for the last episodes to become available which made me appreciate the series even more as I understood it better compared to the first time where I could not contain my excitement and rushed into watching it. Now, I have completed the series and I am over the moon. It was so beautiful. A story of love, family, reconciliation, friendship, character, sacrifice, perseverance, patience, selflessness, humility and so much more. Your one stop shop to a feel good k-drama. Highly recommended⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Overall love it. Enjoy 😊.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I watched the whole series, but it didn't bring anything new or exciting. At first, it seemed promising, especially in how it explored the main character's story. When Vincenzo made a cameo, things got interesting. But then, it went downhill. The show became all about drama, ignoring other important storylines. Some scenes dragged on too long, with lots of unnecessary emotions and twists that didn't matter.The show looked good with its camera work, acting, and music, but it had some big problems. The bad guy was shallow, just after money and power. And the main girl's family was portrayed as kind of dumb, which didn't make sense. The story was too predictable, following a basic pattern with choices that didn't seem real.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Wasted my 6 hours to find out what the hype is all about this drama turning into a big waste of time. I think go back couple handled this genre pretty well considering how they're handling this. Both leads are pretty generic characters too. And them showing ML too much of a hero was putting me off. Sorry for others it's just my personal opinion.

The plot, the chemistry, the acting, ost, everything was top tier. They truly deserved all the praises and audience.We are so used to watching kdramas that end with ""They lived happily ever after"" that watching QoT and seeing what happens after ""happily ever after"" was amazing and super different. I'm not knetz but I feel like, after so many years, QoT was the drama who made korean people gather together to freak about a kdrama again. And this already tells a lot about the drama.Kim SooHyun and Kim Jiwon (also all the crew) gave us an unforgettable love story with BaekHong couple. I'll thank them forever for accepting their roles on this. Queen of Tears has become one of my favorites kdramas, so yeah, I recommend it.

Of course there will always be tropes or the usual associated with k dramas but in reality it depends on.how it's executed and here it's executed flawlessly. I have never cried so much watching anything ever. These actors especially the two leads ( The two Kim's ) Kim Ji-won and Kim Soo-hyun were amazing if you pay attention to the micro emotions. I would say only one episode didn't feel in flow with the series that being ep. 14 for me. Overall it was visually amazing, the story was utterly complete and unlike most k dramas it had an entire conclusion in the end. As for the many things that happen to this couple in the drama well rich people get victimized too. Everyone is human. The best k drama I've ever seen.

If you are an Indian then I would tell you brother that you like all Bollywood movies And start watching Korean movie. In this you get to know the meaning of patience, if any movie of us is made then the foolishness starts in it, which is wrong That's why watch this kind of movie where there is love, care and worry, however much I add it is less.

tt27668559,"Visually stunning spectacle with a promising premise that unfortunately falls flat due to a mediocre and sloppy storyline. While the lead actors' undeniable chemistry manages to salvage some moments, it's not enough to overshadow the glaring shortcomings of the plot.The story feels rushed and disjointed, with gaping plot holes that leave viewers scratching their heads. It's evident that the creators poured a hefty budget into the production, evident in the lavish sets and breathtaking cinematography.What saves Queen of Tears from being a complete disappointment is the lead actors' palpable chemistry. Despite the weak material they're given to work with, they manage to inject life into their characters and deliver believable performances. Particularly, Kim Ji Won shines with her acting prowess, showcasing potential that could lead to promising opportunities in the future.IT may offer some entertainment value as a one-time watch, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impact. The high production value and memorable lead pair might be enough to draw viewers in initially, but the lack of substance ensures that it won't stand the test of time.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I really enjoyed the series. The main leads had great chemistry and the rest of the cast was excellent too. As always, this is a K-Drama and it seems all the directors goes to the same school for directing and storytelling. They love to reuse the grabbing of the wrist/arm to get the girl's attention. They use 5-10 camera angles saving someone from falling. They have the ""deer in the headlights"" reaction when being kiss or hug. They have drivers that never slow down when someone is standing in the middle of the crosswalk. And the directors love to have someone stop in the middle of the crosswalk to chat. I do want to point out some ""bulging eyes, hands to the head"" WTF moments. I know some of these examples is probably to add suspense and push the narrative forward, but...!? When the main villain has the rifle pointed to Baek and Hong, after the police told him to drop the weapon and he started to raise the rifle, they should have shot him! And even when he shoots them, the police doesn't do anything and actually gave him time to reload his rifle before opening fire?? The worst moment is the chairman not questioning the clause in the contract! If the Hongs has a scandal, all shares and interest goes to the villain?? Only Baek said that the clause should've been taken out. I guess the writer of the show wanted us to believe that the Hongs are idiots and morons. Like I said, the directors must all use the same manual when creating these moments and scenes. Ahhhh, but that's why we love watching K-drama/romcom because of these cheesy and head scratching sequences! Overall, Queen of Tears was a fun and very romantic series. I highly recommend it!",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"The plot itself is a standard. Rich family and a bunch of people who would like to take their wealth. When they do, the family is trying to win their things back and that's it. I find it absurd that the whole family is portrayed so naive, even the lead actresses who is a stern/""cold"" business woman. And I find it even more unbelievable that the 3/4 of the cast are against them and they can do absolutely everything. Bribe, lie, do break ins, incitements... Anyhow, twists and spins are predictable, so is the love story between main characters with their ups and downs. There are moments which will make you laugh and moments that will make you cringe. Overall, I give it a 6*. Nothing breathtaking, but still worth your time if you like that genre.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I love the work of Park Ji-eun as well as the leads and cast chosen. Even the storyline was interesting. But, in the end, there were too many situations and plot aspects that were inconsistent with common sense and reality that it distracted from my viewing pleasure. I do understand you have to suspend logic and soften the viewing lens sometimes- I am OK with that. I won't give away any spoilers but I count at least 20 times where I found myself saying out loud, 'that doesn't make sense', 'his character wouldn't do that...', 'why didn't they do this/that?'. Crash Landing handled these situations well enough to help us move forward. This program didn't and it's a pity. This series could have been a classic.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

The bond between soo cheol and da Hye is also very nice cause they care for each other. I really liked our leading couple.When my friend told me that she couldn't stop her tears while watching few scenes, i couldn't believe her. I was like, who will cry watching drama.

I'm rooting for Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji Won as a couple outside the drama. Their chemistry on-screen was beyond the roof. If I'm being honest I wouldn't want a part two because it's perfect.

I understand the truly rich live with a different set of rules nd , yes, there is a strain of insanity😉 likely... but seriously, I found this series awfully tiresome. Watching the first four episodes was tough.I know my review is contrarian to the majority of reviewers here. Having said that, I watch absolute slapstick and sometimes poorly made shows.

There are other greats in my top ten, but this is going to be extremely hard to knock from that position for me.The introduction of the characters, their immediate believability, the acting strength of each and every member of the cast, the absolutely gut wrenching emotions displayed, and the beautifully poignant ending makes this a full 10.

tt27668559,"Queen of Tears is a K-drama of two halves. The first, composed of its early episodes, is an innovative take on K-drama romance. The other is a chaotic second half that squanders much of the potential of its beginning. The Netflix hit ended Sunday with a global audience that exceeded the wildly popular Crash Landing on You.In terms of chemistry, the leads were a perfect pair. It's like they were crafted from the cosmic dust of perfect on-screen couples. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for other characters and sub-plots on the show, which are more disconcerting than fascinating.Plotwise, the series started losing its charm in the second half as well. The amount of scenes that felt repetitive and the back and forth between the main leads only showed the lack of creativity of the writer. While the show we ended up with remains compelling, even fun, to the end, the decision to dispense with its profoundly tragic and emotional core makes the endeavor more rote and, at times, even boring. The series never recaptures the rare thrill of its early episodes, but nevertheless had a sweet ending that will surely be a satisfactory element.My Rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"I wished to see something different, but 2 episodes in and I felt like the writers have played it safe by using the old popular over-the-top grandiose story of ultrarich and their stereotypical characterization - some cold-hearted and stiff, some unbearably childish.I like Kim Soo Hyun and his dramas have been really outstanding. But here, although he still delivers some powerful acting, I felt like somehow he's acting too cute and not so natural anymore like before. The female lead's character is cold and seems a bit tired, that all I can see is a well-rehearsed acting, lacking depth much like the storyline. I am sure she's been great in previous works.This drama may be satisfactory enough for Kdrama fans who love glorified stories of ultrarich, beautiful visuals of Korean actors/actresses and popular cheesy romance, but not outstanding enough in terms of acting and storyline to impart anything profound to the viewers. Well, this is just entertainment and that's it; and maybe, this is just how people like it -- just a safe entertaining respite from reality, even if it's superficial.

tt27668559,The fact that this has only 8 stars is mind boggling. Probably the best Kdrama ever made and the only thing close is lovley runner. This has everything you could ask for in a Kdrama the 2 main leads are absolutely incredible and the acting alone is 20/10. The story and drama was amazing. And the co-leads absolutely incredible. There isn't one dull morning episode in this show and you could rewatch it honestly and it just gets better and better. The plot twist in each episode is incredible and the writers did such a incredible job on keeping us on our feet each episode. The last episode alone can make you cry 10 times. If you havnt seen QOT please grab a bag of pop corn and be ready to be emotionally destroyed lol.,positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Literally, I don't know that why some people are saying that the story and the plot is so cringe and it has no story line, but for me it is the best kdrama I've ever watched, like this kdrama made me write a review because I personally don't write reviews but today I had to.So as per the story line, it's too good like I don't have enough words, the storyline gives us a good moral and also it's like that just a few moments ago you have cried and then you are laughing, it's like this. The story takes a big turn! After episode 10, there not might be a kdrama this good. I know it's kinda emotional but some scenes Literally give chills and a good laugh and it's a kdrama or we can say drama in which the main female lead doesn't give attention to the villain, like on indian or any dramas there is that the female lead or the male lead gives attention and gets brain washed because of the villain but in this case nothing happens like this and which is a good thing. The Era from episode 11 to 16 half is the emotional one and the most annoying but also the best. The funniest thing, I have seen the kind cry more than the female lead who was actually dying. But that's okay, that's how love is, now the ending is good too, it contains many emotional or good morals. For me it's the best kdrama in my eyes and opinion, words aren't needed to describe it and how many times I say that it's a very good kdrama, even the best word used describe it is not there in english, no matter how many times I say wheather 100, 100000 or millions or maybe trillions, it won't go up to the level, it is such a beautiful kdrama, it is full of elegance and it is realistic, awfully good..",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"Talking about the character of the villain Yoon Eun-Seong. It was a very well developed historical construction. A villain who in essence is not created to feel hate but rather pity. Eun-Seong, from the beginning to the end of the drama, dedicated himself to doing the best he could, the best he knew and learned to do. A character who grew up with a strong trauma of abandonment and rejection, always on the margins and forgotten, living in the shadows, praying to be remembered by his mother figure. He spent his life developing a strong identity crisis based on a perfect image to be recognized by his obsession, our beloved protagonist Hong Hae-In and also by his mother. As a bonus, he has to confront his greatest enemy, not the protagonist Baek Hyun-Woo, but himself. And every time Eun-Seong had to face that Hyun-Woo was ahead, he felt even more inferior and lost. In the end, our villain's story itself is a true drama. Result of an accumulation of childhood traumas and distortion of self-image. Yoon Eun-Seong, you should never have felt so inferior, you never lacked anything that was left in your classmate, you just lacked therapy (k).The script of lead couple Hong Hae-in and Baek Hyun-Woo was constructed to be relatable. If for a moment, we put aside the entire ramification of the story and focus only on the couple, we spend the entire drama identifying with one context or another of the moment they lived or are living.Real marriage is not a fairy tale and Queen of Tears made a point of reminding us of that. Daily life can be exhausting, the lack of dialogue starts to bother you, pain is felt differently by people, as is grief. The intensity too; everything for two, will always have two perspectives and we can easily forget that and added to a routine life that we are forced to live, love ends! Hae-in and Hyun-Woo showed us this in an extremely faithful and painful way, how the process can be slow, but extremely easy to stop loving someone and not even realize it. And it is in these moments of extreme exhaustion that something always happens, whether in a drama or in real life.Queen of Tears begins and ends with wedding vows for a reason. It's a drama that begins and ends with love, but shows us in the clearest ways possible, that love alone will never be enough; You always have to fight for what you want. And for that we have the entire plot of the series based on this constant struggle for love to prevail. Fight against your own ego, against your own desires, face your fears, admit your mistakes and face the consequences, accept your flaws, learn to give in, explode with anger, cry bitterly, laugh heartily, scream in despair, cry drunk in the corners, vent with friends, being humble and so many other attitudes that not only Hae-in and Hyun-Woo showed us, but also all the other characters in the series showed us.Finally, I would say that Queen of Tears' ""Mexican soap opera"" is wonderful, but the care for reality and the intensity that Queen of Tears delivered was simply perfect. Honorable mention also goes to the protagonists, Kim Soo Hyun and Kim Ji-Won. It was only an incredible K-Drama because the cast was incredible.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

tt27668559,"Korean Drama '' Queen of Tears '' is a dark comedy melodrama.The story is pretty unexpected, especially at the start of the drama, which was more on the comedy side. Slowly, they introduced the dramatic scheme involving the villain and the family, as they go through unexpected changes. Then, the series turns towards the romantic side, with many moments between the couple. The plot gets darker towards the end, with the final episode being quite dramatic. However, it must be noted that the last episodes, especially the fourteenth, were rather boring and felt more or less like fillers.Another perk for this drama was the excellent side characters that were interesting and helped the story a lot.Also, the performances were excellent.So, overall, seven out of ten.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"

This is one of those gems. I can't even decided which was better, the writing or the acting? Probably both. The plot was nothing extraordinary, but the execution was top notch. No amount of reviews can do this drama justice, you should simply watch it for yourself. You will not be disappointed. I see this easily being the best kdrama of the year, and it's not even mid year! Definitely one of the best kdramas I've watched, 10/10!...",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"This series was a bit much.Not only is it 16 episodes, but each one goes for at least 1 hour and a half!! And the script is at least 2 dramas worth of storytelling!!...
That is not to say I did not enjoy it. Luckily, what it does well, it does REALLY well. But you also wonder if it is because of the excessive length, or how it tries to do TOO much, or even how it relentlessly hammers certain feelings and cliches into submission. And at some point, there's too much fluff that gets in the way of what could have been a very effective and efficient core! From deadly diseases, to gigantic corporate power-struggle, even different-class romance, etc.It mostly works because of the leads and some GREAT supporting roles.The male lead is a professional punching bag, but what might be worse, is how perfectly capable he is at dealing with it all. And the female lead is to die for! Then there's the scene composition, editing, production, etc. It's a beautiful show.. so you can tell they used their budget properly (or was rather expensive).I would recommend it IF you can spare the time investment, are fine with overly complicated-and-unrealistic plots that sometimes are resolved quicker than you can see them coming, and accept the fact that they abuse the ""drama playbook"" in its entirety. This has it all, and that might be a fault more than a strength. Thankfully, the ending is so overindulgent that you can let go with a feeling of completion.",neutral,"Drama, Family, Romance"
tt27668559,"All actors are excellent. That's why my wife and I were looking forward to watch this k-drama. However, during the 4th episode we stopped viewing it for various reasons.The basic assumption of this drama, she is going to die within 3 months, is already a matter of taste, but the reaction of the the male lead is absolutely strange. He is full of joy that this way a divorce becomes superfluous. This is the ultimate violation of what marriages are all about. How can someone possibly recover from here?The discussions with his layer friend are weird. They kind of follow the same line of evil reasoning and they happen in public places. For me it is just a question when somebody who is not supposed to hear this will learn about his thoughts this way.Then there is a scene where the makers try to produce tension using a message sent to her cell phone from his relatives about divorce. He has to prevent her from reading it. We felt that we saw this kind of problem already quite often in other dramas or movies. It is just annoying. We used fast-forward to avoid seeing this mess.Btw. His relatives appear stupid when sending this delicate message to her. Their behavior is not understandable. This seems to be a general problem of this drama, that the behavior of the persons involved appears to be unreasonable. This is why we did not feel any emotional relationship with the characters.",negative,"Drama, Family, Romance"

tt27668559,"The plot seems interesting in the beginning, but it kinda lost themselves during 4 to 5 episodes. It gets worse as it reaches 7 episodes. All the plots related to vengeance or coup of the group infiltrate in the family seems unreasonable and unrealistic sometimes. The way that the guy finds the video store is totally out of the blue. One card and he assumes that he has a video that would destroy him.Once the 7 episode shows the divorce issue, everyone forgets everything else and focus only on that.The show had everything to have different twisters and turns, but ended up a story of a vengeance plot that will work out at the 2 last episodes like every kdrama.Kdrama needs to understand that Mexican novelas had their hype as well and it seems that kdrama is getting the same way and soon to be in a level that people are fed up with the same plot.",positive,"Drama, Family, Romance"

Kim Jiwon also did a great job.They are a sweet married couple, just so perfect.💜They set a standard in k-dramas now.Such a sweet couple, hoping they get married irl too😁
It was great drama because it perfectly potraited the after marriage life. Lack of communication can make them fall apart, can make them they are exhausted of eachother but they realise how much they love eachother during the toughest time..

tt27668559,"I'm not the type of person to care about a show enough to create an account and write a review about it, but there's a first for everything!Queen of Tears takes all your common k-drama cliches and completely turns them against you. The story is absolutely flawless in its writing and execution. It perfectly encapsulates the beauty and struggle of marriage, while simultaneously visualizing the wedding vows that couples promise each other. Hyunwoo and Haein took ""for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish"" to another level. Queen of Tears reveals a stunning message about the importance of marriage, true love, family, and togetherness.The acting is beyond my imaginations. Soohyun's every move, action, and adlib is intricately performed, while Jiwon's micro-expressions and eloquence is unmatched. Their chemistry makes you think that not only the characters, but the actors, are genuinely in love with one another. Don't get me started on the rest of the cast. I could go on and on about how wonderfully they portrayed their characters.The show made me laugh out loud, bawl my eyes out, sigh in frustration, gasp in surprise, and everything in between. It's the perfect balance of romance, comedy, suspense, and tragedy. Every episode is excellently paced. It's slow enough for you to savor every heartfelt moment, but quick enough that you won't be bored. And the epilogues? My goodness. They're always the highlights to the already-immaculate episodes.Moreover, the music makes you feel like you're levitating every time you listen to it. Whether it's made for a sad or happy scene, whenever you listen to the OST, it makes you feel all the emotions all over again.

WOWhowever, from then the story is going down hill. It seems the writer for first 2 episodes was paid a lot and then when people got interested, they brought someone else on.The female is supposedly 30 plus years and she acts, whines and does completely silly unreasonable actions towards both male leads as if she is 16 years old... and her 18 years old self is perhaps intellectually deficient or perhaps with IQ of a goose. Most annoying. The writers have no idea of how smart teenager girls are and how well they know how to work (watch Twinkling Watermelon or Pyramid Game please)2. After a jump of 18 years, they still look the same; GET a grip.. he is an idol, maybe he got all sort of treatments, but the girl has been wheel chair bound. No convincing at all.3. She has gone back in past to save her, but she is clueless totally, NO PLAN - NO idea what to do,, just jumping on random occasions and be all over him and when he reciprocates, she runs away without even the curtesy of explaining her.4. Male lead fell in love with what exactly??? More so the 2nd male lead. Baffling. Male lead does not ever demand her to explain her actions and she does not even offer it. What is this?5. Her own memory has gaps the size or antarctica. She has no idea of her past, of her accident, of her abuser... what happened to her memory.The story is getting weirder with every passing episode and more and more annoying... The reason more than 50% of viewership and rating is SIMPLY MALE LEAD... He has CHARISMA. All else is truly below average.And shout out to two actors, excellent performances, the mother of FL and father of ML -- very fine acting, so bad they don't have good dialogues.

You get everything in it, meaning it also shows you when the girl, who is the heroine, has an accident and ends up in the future, how she feels, and when she likes an idea of a guy who is a star and has been in love with her for 10 years, but she doesn't know that we have a relationship together.

Byeon Woo Seok's acting though his character seemed one dimensional, yet he's able to convey emotional depth and his micro-expression was good. On the other hand, Kim Hye Yoon's overacting became too much as the story progressed. I'm not particular impressed with her continued wide-eyed look, and felt she was stiff in intimate scenes.

tt31324295,The story starts off quite involving. The first half is quite good. You want to see her save him from suicide and her from paralysis. The appealing cast helps. She is perky without being annoying. He inhabits this star making vehicle perfectly. He is a bit too tall for her. Some of the OST music is nice too.Unfortunately there are too many travels back and forth so everything you watched before feels like a waste of time. It becomes confusing and hard to follow and ridiculous. Cannot keep track of what he or she knows or remembers after a while. The criminal guy going after her feels totally out of place. So many scenes and several trips back in time could have been eliminated.If this series had been 8 or the most 12 episodes it would have been better. The repetitive storyline would have been avoided.

Adittionally the explanation of time travel, final resolution and grandma's role could have been better. They insisted too much on unimportant issurs and lost sight of others, as reaction of the boss and acquaintances when they met; additionally ML and FL relation was too calm after they finally find each other happy. I would have expected more passion and impatience after they had waited one after the other for so many years and had been lost so many times; very good chemistry.I gave this an 8, either it should have been a 9, just because I don't think it is better than ""Alchemy of Souls"" and ""Crash Landing on you"".",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Lovely Runner is off to a good start with the first two episodes. I woud have wished it to be on Netflix or Amazon Prime since it would reach a lot more people and i am sure people of all ages would tune in. The balance feels right with the mix of angst and rom-com. I have not found a single dull moment so far and that is thanks to the production team, from how it was being directed and edited. The casting director has done an incredible job at getting the main leads Byeon Wooseok and Kim Hyeyoon. They simply turned into their characters, same goes to the rest of the cast. At times people would feel to skip scenes from the side characters but in this case you look forward to every detail. Looking forward to the next episodes.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Love the plot twist in the second episode. Love the chemistry between main leads. Hope they have a happy ending. I can't wait for more episodes. I am sure everyone will like this kdrama. If u r looking for a drama to watch, you can definitely watch lovely runner. Sunjae crushing on Imsol and Imsol fangirling Sunjae made the drama more interesting. And the second lead gave me Han seo jun vibes. I can feel that this drama is gonna be more interesting in the upcoming episodes.

It's almost 5am, I stayed up binging the final three episodes and have no regrets. Like, I am speechless after just having watched the final episode minutes ago, but the kind of speechless I will remember forever. I laughed, cried, swooned, hid my eyes in fear, and fell in love with every single character in the show. They stuck that final landing like a gold medal gymnast gracefully flipping through the air and landing light as air. I have no notes, no qualms (except if I'm being picky who was knocking on you know who's door on that fateful day, I thought we'd resolve that!). Im Sol and Ryu Sun Jae are my babies forever, love them so much. I'm only sad that it's over. I'm only sad the excitement of watching for the first time is never to return. But I'm also thrilled at the idea that I can rewatch this series as much as I want. Because it's one of my all time faves, Romantic Comedy at its finest, making What's Wrong With Secretary Kim proud. This puts U. S. shows to shame too. Everyone get at Lovely Runners level. Will imdbers agree in time and get the rating back to 9? Or will the ratings here mean nothing as always, I guess time will tell.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

I was wishing him that when will he come back as a lead here here it is .drama must watch if you r fan of love drama it is worth watching it. Hope you guys enjoy cuz I ' m really over the moon by this drama. It's very new kind of love i m gonna watch basically it's a fiction I guess as I seen in episode 1 .

The actors are so top-notch, especially the lead actor who is not just talented but also incredibly charming. And the female lead? She is just adorable! Sure, there are moments when things slow down a bit, but overall, I am totally invested and eagerly waiting for each new episode. There is something about the blend of mystery, great characters, and that time-travel twist that's got me completely captivated. Can't wait to see what happens next!",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Time traveling to your younger self is not a new concept but this movie outshines in corniness and forced romance despite not showing the adequate and logical reasons for their actions at times. In another word, their intimacy and relationships felt rush in order to spoon feed the viewers the artificial 'sweetness' that you'd expected. The acting and the character growth felt short and lack depth. I'm not against these troupes but I was hoping something more mature and fulfillment. The male lead's existing feelings for the female lead makes her stalking and obsession more palatable and unrealistic.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"My SolJae.. What will I do now every Monday and Tuesday? As much as I have loved other dramas, I think this might just be in my top five all time. With the love story that I have been following between these two, and have been watching since basically the beginning, I don't know how quickly I can let them go. These two either brought a smile to my face or tears with each episode.The acting within this project is phenomenal. I felt as if I was genuinely a character in the show with how much emotion and attachment I've grown upon these characters. The chemistry made me feel as if they were actually together. I love both of these actors so much, and I will continue to love them, but Lovely Runner will forever hold a place in my heart.The story follows Im Sol, a girl who's a fangirl of a K-Pop group called Eclipse. She had bought a watch at an auction that once belonged to her favorite member, Ryu Sunjae. Once 2023 begins, that Sunjae passes away, but there's nothing she could do from stopping his death, right? Things began to go into a spiral when she clicks the watch and she goes back 15 years into the past. While there, she meets her favorite member when he was a high schooler. Now she's in her 2008 body and finds that she lived across from him. What will she do now that she is trying to correct time and keep him from his ""unfixable"" fate?I just want to say that this romance is one of a kind. My favorite part about this story is the fact that Sunjae is a loser in love. No matter if he is a singer, an actor, or just a regular highschool boy, he still acts out in front of his crush. He may have lost his memories throughout each lifetime, but he will always find his way back to Sol. It didn't matter what universe or weird time jumps occurred, he always found his way back to the one he loved. His destiny was to be with her, even if he were to have died.This drama deserves all of the hype!! I'm so sad to see them go but I'm also so happy that I got to experience such a wonderful story. This marks an end of a chapter, but there will always be more to come.ALSO!! I loved the fact that even when the future changed, Sunjae was always meant to be some sort of famous person in South Korea. He was a singer whose group sold out tickets, but he was also an actor who had successful dramas. But his occupation didn't matter, he was still Sol's.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Absolutely perfect, I have nothing to say about it! The actors are excellent, the story is perfect in my opinion, I love the concept of the story, based with very funny comedy and a happy ending! Nothing better than that! It's really a big favorite for me. I have never named a film or series as my favorite but this is going to be the first! I simply adore it. More series like this and I would be delighted! Of course not everyone would appreciate this series because it is a bit cliché, but for those who love clichés like me with happy endings, a little suspense, full of humor, a little sadder moments, fantasy and a cute romance you will love! This series has excellent music, I even listen to it in my car, the scenario is well represented, the emotion is very present and the actors are wonderfully chosen! The combination of Byeon Woo-Seok and Kim Hye-Yoon creates a rather unexpected duo in my opinion, but exceptionally well matched! They go so well together.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Most of the Korean drama become boring after a few episodes but it was a exception...the people rating low didn't see the whole drama I guess and saying nonsense and stupid reasons to not like it...you should watch it first. It's much more interesting to me than queen of tears too...I loved it so much ... And again it's my personal opinion... I wasn't planning to watch this drama but while I started I liked it more and more.... Some people are saying that they rated it because of charisma of male lead or it seemed bore to them after first few episodes... While All of the episode are equally good..and female lead too.... They are lovely 😍 Best of luck to them.,positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Honestly there are so many plots by the first episodes which gets the person more excited and can't wait for the next episode, it's so unpredictable and really really exciting but over all I really do recommend it, in the end it's honestly such a nice series.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

however the amazing rating of this series forced me to start it immediately.Ofcourse it was also because of Byeon Woo-seok's beautiful face <3When I started the series this Saturday - 10 episodes had already aired.And before I knew it on Sunday night I was already on Episode 6 !!!It is such a quick watch - once you start you just cannot stop.It has rarely happened with me where I am already in love with the series and planning to watch it again once it is over.Currently I am on episode 10 and trying my best not to watch further until the remaining episode (13 - 16) have aired as I do not want to sit and wait for the finale.I am really hoping it has a happy ending.And not just any happy ending - a detailed beautiful complete happy ending !Not something rushed and incomplete....So as of now - at episode 10 - its a 10 star rating for me.I hope i dont have to come and change it later on :)I tried not to give any spoilers at all in my review.

Honestly, I didn't want to watch the rest of the series. I didn't get hooked right away, but wanted to give it a fair chance.Later when I saw the guy's perspective, the storyline made more sense and I found it more enjoyable to watch. The girl is a great actress, but my goodness her character is such a crybaby! It's exhausting to watch her cry over small things and tears became meaningless overtime that I couldn't get emotional.Overall, this is a true ""rom-com"" and ""fantasy"". Although, I didn't shed a tear on lovely runner, it's still a unique show to watch. For me, this didn't live up to the hype. One thing I'm sure is that I won't be rewatching it.

Lol Never ever crossed my mind that they would give us THIS much chemistry and let alone be obsessed with SolJae couple. Seriously, this pairing is so GOOD and so cute.Kim Hye Yoon deserves to be casted as she truly portrayed Im Sol. She shined so much here. Her versatility and her showing so many emotions all at once is remarkable.Byeon Woo Seok, delivers Ryu Sun Jae's character as well. His dynamics and expressions are on point. I'm literally in awe of how talented he is?! Like, his vocals??? He could do KPOP/Band vocalist full time! So happy for him he's getting the popularity he deserves now. (Don't sleep on him! He might be the next rom-com king!)This is exactly the rom-com I needed. I honestly love this so much as I have been looking for dramas that are light and not stressful. This is what I'm hoping for!

Lovely Runner turned out to have an interesting plot filled with so much comical relief. It really delivered in ways other KDramas haven't been able to this year.The cast was simply fantastic! Woo Seok and Huy Yoon really captive the audience in their roles as Im Sol and Ruy Sun Jae. Both talended with such an incredible future awaiting for them to be conqured over and over. All the cast was superb, but our leads were living in their own world and we as spectators enjoyed every single minute.No sponsors? No big stream service? Three years to find Sun Jae? No worries at all! All of the hardships and struggles only make this drama more memorable. You have to find yourself asking what the experts in this field didn't see that everyone else did so quickly! Hyu Yoon and Woo Seok saw what the others didn't. This project was meant for them. Only them and the rest of the cast could make it so memorable and relatable.As fate defied destiny in the series, Lovely Runner did the same in real life since its beginnings. I can't stop recommending this beautiful, fun, and intense love story.Hyu Yoon and Woo Seok as Im Sol and RyuSun Jae are a couple to live by. I don't know what the future holds for them personally just yet but their performances in Lovely Runner are nothing but legendary.Well done!!!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

The way the characters expressed their emotions is very natural.The storyline tugged at my heart strings.Time travel genre isn't at all my cup of tea but, I see woo seok, I click
Honestly I only wanted to watch the drama because of the male lead I don't usually understand time travel stories. But this one got me on my knees . The pure feelings of love expressed by the leads is so heart warming and makes one want to experience such raw feelings of love which is unconditional. Also thrilling cliffhangers at the end of each episode .More than best must watch

Comfort green flag characters (even when sonjae was jealous HE WAS JUST SO CUTE it wasn't a bad red flag move)
Hilarious scenes
Absolutely adorable romantic scenes
Beautiful cinematography and ost (and literally every song in the show was a masterpiece)
Outstanding acting from literally everyone
Some adventure and fantasy (and because of that we got so many protective cute moments, they were protecting each other all the time I wanted to scream)
Nice little plot twists and attention to the details,
A clever script
An ending with no loopholes, just comfort and happiness. And something really important? NO boring episodes! I finished this in 2 days, while in most kdramas I take (at the very very least) a week (or even months tbh).All the unrealistic and cliche moments were because it's based on a webtoon like come on if they got rid of some unnecessary trippings etc you would be like ""but you erased scenes from the webtoon you ruined it"" WELL here they are!!!!!!!Overall 10000/10

This drama is for the people who enjoy stories about two people who will keep choosing each other time and time again. I think the plot and storyline were written well, the pacing was good and I liked how the characters developed or changed whenever Im Sol changed the past.I especially liked the gradual friendship that was forged between RSJ and Kim Taesung. Speaking of their friendship, I was so relieved when the writers decided to NOT go with the love triangle trope. Instead they focused on writing 2 guys who were major simps for Im Sol, which turned out for the best. There were a lot of other things I liked about the drama, such as how RSJ got closer to his band mate and friend Baek Inhyuk, which was a contrast from their ""first lives""; the chemistry between the lead actors; the soundtrack; the humour sprinkled in the story to keep the overall tone lighthearted; the angst.I was also impressed by the actress who plays Im Sol.

However, I'm not a fan of him but a fan of time travel drama as long as it integrates many elements like Someday or One Day, Reset, Rebooting..The opening starts off quite well. When it comes to episode 3, it turns out to be the heavily repetition of the content, same romance setting, same jokes, same murder chasing scene as well as same crying scene!! I am question myself if I am missing something and watching the same high rating drama. Then I decided to turn on the YouTube spoiler version and found nothing is missing. There is no brain-burning reversals and other suspenseful pursuit of the murderer. Last episode is all about pure love and like family reunion drama genre.

Byeon Woo-seok is spectacular as the adorable Sun Jae, making it impossible to think of another actor to play this role. He represents it so naturally and with such sweetness that it hurts the smile that appears on your face every time he enters the scene. Kim Hye-yoon, gives life to Im Sol and makes you love her from the moment you see her, get into her story and experience each of her emotions. Special mention for Song Geon-hee, who plays Tae Sung, the second lead who, far from being a problem in the story, is a common and relevant thread for both romance, drama, comedy and bromance. .

It was like watching them grow up, followed their journey of life and saw everything they went through, cried with them, laughed with them, and then boom.The TV show ended. You're never going to see them ever again. And that's just weird, because it almost feels like you raised them. Like they're your best friends. At least, that's how I feel.

The song and visuals are excellent. My personal favorite from the OST is ""Sudden Shower"" by Eclipse and ""Like a dream"" by Minnie. Both songs has been added to my Kdrama playlist so I can listen to them all day.The ending of this drama showed that all sacrifices and challenges overcame were not in vain, it was all worth it in the end.

There is specially one detail that ,makes so sense but the director didn't make it look loud yet so beautifully expressed that it makes my sob every time I think about it---sun jae not being a part of eclipse shows such a beautiful detail that the show has...let me explain (as per my thought) --sun jae was in eclipse in first two future but not in ultimate future because in first two time sun jae song ""sonaki"" was his gateway to music industry, which he wrote about his first love im sol... but in last time he never met sol, so 'sonaki"" never happened...that means sun jae was and was not in eclipse bcoz of sol...I'm sobbing every time im thinking about this..i mean how insanely beautiful the drama is ...",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Not inly main characters but also supporting actors contribution is commendable. Story has everything, comedy, drama, romance. Beyon woo seok, main lead actor is just dreamy! He makes you cry, laugh, blush! Kim hye yoon has done great things in the show. She does comedy naturally. I am looking forward to see this couple in more dramas! One of the must watch kdrama if you are new at kdramas. Storyline is ultimate love story. In this drama You will see sacrifices one can make for each other and to which extent one can go for love in a very romantic way. I highly recommend this drama! Happy watching!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"I'm a very picky culture consumer, especially when it comes to romance, but this show..! I loved everything about it: the cast, the plot, the OST, the emotions jumping from LOL to angst. A true gem, a show I will watch over and over again. Knowing that the show didn't happen for several years, how it started out as an underdog, made it so much better. You don't have to cast the best paid or most famous actors/actresses to create a great show. I enjoyed every moment of this kdrama. It's my favourite by far.Thank you Kim Hye Yoon and Byeon Woo Seok for your outstanding portrayals of Im Sol and Ryu Seon Jae!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Really love watching this
Earlier i used to wait for weekends but now I just wait for weekend to end😅😅
I personally recommend everyone to see this drama
Believe me you won't get disappointed
I personally never enjoyed watching time travel kind of shows but this is something different,something that you will surely like to see
16 episodes are not just enough but wish to see their happy ending soon😂😅

tt31324295,"Again...nothing new to see from korean dramas. Very shallow, boring, predictable. Started as a fun and entertaining rom-com delivering some well established cliches. And next? It turned into its worst nightmare - poorly written development making the last few episodes lose the initial charm. The fate of many dramas in the past. The fate of many dramas to come. Truth to be told, I have no idea how to write the review in a way that will point out all the issues I had. The drama is honestly mediocre. And it's not like the plot was well developed. The crime/mystery part is laughably bad with ridiculous conclusions. Something about ""fix me"" stories as it relates to people with disabilities just doesn't sit right with me. Sadly Runner is more like it.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,One of the best dramas I have ever seen. Normally I never watch K-dramas Cause I am fan of c dramas...but truly this one has just dragged me to watch this ...every episode till now is just something else....as a fan you can relate with heroin and you can feel every episode...so touching and awesome which can't be express by words.just hoping for a good ending..And the most cutest thing in the drama is sun jae's smile that's killing...im sol reaction can truly shows how we fan girls do. Can't be more real than this..But the most annoying thing about the drama is we have to whole week for the next episode 🙃 I feel so good in Monday and so bad in Tuesday uhhhhhh and also only 16 episodes whyyyyy.,positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

I personally don't like teenage romance, but Lovely Runner is different, it just made me aware of all the levels of love in 16 episodes. It taught me that whatever chance you get in life to change your fate do it and enjoy every freaking change your 1 inch step made for you.This drama also has the perfect balance of comedy with romance, nothing is going over the board...just that taxi driver is so annoying to me, his side of story should also be explained to calm my nerves a bit.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"This show is so fun to watch. It is advertised as a Rom-Com, but it really is so much more. The chemistry between the two leads is very moving so you laugh at the comic scenes and get nervous when there are dramatic scenes. I have watched more than half the total episodes and I can't wait for more....just what the writers wanted. At the heart of the show is what would you do if you could go back in time and change your future. But no time change is without consequences. That's where the drama and comedic scenes really come alive. If you are emotionally exhausted from Queen of Tears, watch this show to recharge your love of K-Dramas. You will absolutely adore Lovely Runner.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

I would love to watch this over and over again, I'm just confused as to why Im Sol keeps coming back when everything was looking fine. I'm sure we'll know within the next episodes.

tt31324295,"Man o man, where do I even start. The year 2017 was definitely the last time I had genuine interest in kdramas and was keeping up with it. But from then on I gradually lost interest and would give up on dramas after watching only 2 3 ep. But oh my goodness what's with this drama LOVELY RUNNER?Cast: Each and every character is living upto their role. Yeah Sunjae and imsol is the ML and FL. But with their acting, they even bring the side characters to the spotlight. No overdose of cringe or cloche moments. Like ep 10 was so freaking sad and then in ep 11 I laughed like a damn dolphin. Also the romance, the thriller, the cliffhanger, the wholesomeness, friendship, family everything is so damn good.This year 2024 is definitely going to be Kim Hye yoon and Byeon Woo seok year. But for me its definitely the end of kdrama year lmao. Because of the bar that has been set by Lovely runner is so high, no matter what I watch, nothing seems interesting to me anymore lol.Last but not least this drama is definitely an experience and emotions that was long forgotten.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"I should've learned my lesson when I was disappointed in Queen of Tears after all the hype and positive reviews it got. I thought this was different because it got way more hype than QOT, also fans said this drama has the vibe of 2016 dramas. I said to myself ""OK let's give it a try, maybe this one is worth the hype, maybe it's different"" NOpe! It is NOT. It's even worse than QOT. Thus, I concluded, ""The more hype a show gets, the more likely it is to be dull.""The synopsis was captivating. I was looking forward to the whole story and thought it would be something amazing and unique. But, man, how quickly that illusion dies. As soon as episode 3, there is one word that resonates just about right: abysmal.Such an amateurish, tacky, and unintelligent string of cheesy cliches that goes on and on and on... sheer smother. All the cliches you could possibly think of are present here. The deep past connection, the multiple ridiculous coincidences, the overly stupid misunderstandings, the umbrella scene (Gosh this particular one was used to no end), the cringy drunken scenes where they confess their feelings and do not remember what they did the next day, the ML rescuing the FL and getting her out of a situation she put herself in out of her pure idiocy, the rain falling whenever the writer feels like it, the ""I hate this person so much"" to ""omo! Why my heartbeats speed whenever I see him"", the fighting over an object then accidentally falling gracefully to the floor with bodies pressed against each other and then a staring contest begins, deciding not to leave and running back in the last minute at the airport...
I always wondered why writers still make the same outdated idiotic cliches, well I have finally found my answer: people still fall for it. Every time! Especially if the actors are attractive, they'll freaking go insane about it, as if it's something they've never seen before.The ML is ok-ish. He has potential, especially in comedy and action, romance not so much. I cringed every time he acted all lovey-dovey around the FL, so I skipped all those scenes. His character is shallow and one-dimensional, sometimes he's like a dead fish going with the flow. The suicide part is undeveloped. We see him depressed for 2-3 minutes then *splash* he's dead. We're told he did it out of depression, but we were never truly shown the reasons behind his *dePrEssion*. It made his suicide silly and pointless; it reminded me of the time Michael Scott from the office was on the roof faking a suicide attempt because of depression too. Only there wasn't Dwight Shrute to tell him from the bottom: ""dePrEssion isn't that just a fancy word for feeling *bummed out*?""The FL actress and character are pure torture to the eye. Her overacting was painfully unbearable, and her voice grated on every nerve I had. This is the third drama I watched of her, and oh dear God! In all those three she is the SAME person. Same annoying expressions and cringy behaviors. It was so uncomfortable that I would hide the screen with my hand and read the subtitles. All the FLs of Rom-Coms tend to be dumb and clumsy but her character is on a whole other level. The number of times she acts surprised with eyes wide open saying oh! Is endless, to the point where it became her signature look for me. The main reason that made her cling to life again and become a die-hard fan of Sun-Jae is simply laughable. Are we supposed to believe that when you're at the lowest point of your life, depressed and on the verge of killing yourself, a stranger on the radio saying to you ""Live another day"" would restore your will to live? Seriously, the way the writer handles psychological disorders is absolute nonsense.Both reasons for her becoming an obsessed fan and him committing suicide are poorly written and underdeveloped. It's really frustrating because the story was built on these two major elements that were totally ignored after episode one. So, the first episode was useless, they could've just shown us a slide of the synopsis and we'd still be able to follow the rest of the story, which turns out to be nothing but a salad of irrational, illogical, and completely meaningless decisions, reactions and twists in a vain attempt to patch up all the holes of an already stupid enough scenario and bring it to an end.I watched it on higher speed up to ep 10 so I really tried, until I thought ""Why am I doing this to myself?"". So, I took a break from watching for several days to recover from the writer's terrorist attack on my brain. After that, I was skipping past everything just to reach the end.If I were a teen, then yes, maybe I would've liked it. But I fail to understand, for the life of me, how would a mature rational human being rate this brain-melting idiocy a 10/10?If you value your brain, skip this pile of amateurish cliches.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

tt31324295,"Yes, this is the best kdrama you will ever watch.I don't even know where to begin because this show has literally EVERYTHING! You want romance? They got it. Comedy? They got it. Drama? You best believe they got it. Fantasy, Mystery, and Thriller? Of course!I'm writing this week before the show ends, hoping I can take my time to review everything I love about this show and why I think the show is a must-watch! The first thing that I should mention is that there is a familiarity when it comes to Lovely Runner from your favorite kdramas, such as Twinkling Watermelon, Strong Woman Do Bong Song, 20th Century Girl, Twenty-Five Twenty-One, and My Lovely Stranger. Yet, besides all of that, this show is very different. It's nothing like the shows I mentioned. I don't want to give much away since this is a spoiler-free review, but it's safe to say there's a lot of familiarity with the show, BUT there is also a lot of originality. The Twist and Turns... When I say this show is unpredictable, I genuinely mean it. When I tell you I did not expect a reveal so soon at the end of the 2nd episode, I knew that this show would continue blowing my expectations; I was not wrong. Every week, this show continued to surprise us in the best way possible. For a Romantic Comedy with Fantasy and thriller, the show thrives in everything! I have watched many dramas, and what feels like forever, it truly feels like you're watching true love. What Imsol and Sunjae have feels and looks natural. When I watch each episode, I feel like I'm watching these two people fall in love repeatedly. It makes me all giddy inside as the two try desperately to hold on to each other.Speaking of Imsol and Sunjae, let's speak about the beautiful actors who portray them. Kim Hye-Yoon, THE WOMAN YOU ARE! I've actually been following this show since it was announced because of Hye-Yoon. I'm a big fan of her and happy to see her get the recognition she deserves since I believe she is one of the best actors I have ever seen (watch her in Sky Castle; there's no better example). Hye-Yoon always gives it her all and works endlessly to provide us with the best results. I mean, the fact I could tell which Imsol she was playing, I think, says it all. This girl has RANGE. Hye-Yoon plays Imsol with so much love, as someone once commented, ""The person who loved Seonjae more than anyone else and understood Imsol more than anyone else was Kim Hye-yoon."" Not to mention, this show would not have existed without her. She is the reason why we have this fantastic show to watch. For apparent reasons, I think a lot of the spotlight is more on Byeon Woo-Seok. Still, I hope Hye-Yoon doesn't get forgotten when this is all done and shines as much as him because she deserves it.Now Woo-Seok, I've been a fan of him since 20th Century Girl. I'd seen his work before the movie, and he always stood out to me with his acting; maybe his height helped a little, too. I genuinely appreciate Wook-Seok for bringing to life a character that feels fresh and exciting to watch. When I say, his portrayal of Sunjae being the GREENEST FLAG THERE IS, I'm not kidding. He indeed wears his heart on his sleeves, and with his facile expression, he is easy to read. Something to mention is that these two actors have to play teenagers, young adults, and adults, which is already impressive. The two perfectly play the awkward years and the maturing times. The two both play their character with love and innocence with a little of a rough side.As I currently listen to the music on repeat, yes, on repeat, because the soundtrack is that good. It evokes emotions that remind me of everything I love about this show. The young love that lasts through the years, the heartbreak, the joy, and the anticipation. It's hard to put everything I feel through words as I try to write, but I want to mention that I love every song dearly, and they share a core memory. A memory I hope to not forget.So, in conclusion... yes, I highly recommend this show!!! Now go watch!!!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,After watching 100 of kdramas in my life.i have never rated and reviewed it.but for the first time i am here only for my SUN JAE and IM SOL..please watch it even if you're aren't not a fan of rom com..this will make you one. My Monday and Thursday was never this much exiting before lovely runner..every episode has its own twist.you will wonder what will happen in the next coming episode.. although you might have gotten so many spoilers online because of its popularity...bt still those funny moments will make you laugh and those sad moments will make you cry..so hope for the best...and gooooo watch it.,positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Although they tried to muck it up with cliche scenes (flashbacks, slow catches, so-so side murderer plot), they couldn't make you Lovely Runner.What I think they got right:
-Choosing the PERFECT cast! Byeon Woo-Seok is the most IN LOVE man I've seen a in while!-We got an awesome setup episode that really opened up the world we were joining.-We got introduced to the mystery aspect pretty early on so it wasn't just thrown in there hastily
-A original story with a non original theme (time travel)
-No awkward skinship
-very nice ost
-comedy (I had hoped they'd continue to poke fun at clichés like when the friend was dropping petals from the roof, but see below)What I would mildly critique them on
-Hye-Yoon really got to show some acting skills but I think the writers did too much having Sol CRY in 75% of her scenes.-They quickly abandoned the cute ending scene where we see something change in the future at the end of the episode (the photo appearing on the table)
-With such good writing for the main characters, it was disappointing to see the same ""older brother / sister's best friend"" relationship play out the same as countless other dramas.-As mentioned, they really went out of their way to include those overused elements that all k-romances use.... I can forgive the 8 umbrella scenes because at least the rain was built as plot device.It seems like I have more negatives but that's just not true. This was really a good drama if you're looking for some romance. You will feel the swoon all over because the leads were very believable as in love.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Lovely runner left me speechless, i just can't seem to find the right words to express how. By delving into these deeper aspects of the characters' lives, this drama resonates with viewers profoundly. This drama provide an escape into a world where love conquers all and i am overjoyed with their witty banters, slapstick humor, and memorable picturesque moments. It has fast-paced, energetic rhythm that keeps the story moving along and holds viewers' attention. It doesn't drag or feel too rushed, it has the right balance between romance, comedy, and plot development.

tt31324295,"I'm so confused! How could they go back in time 15 years but the characters look exactly the same at 19 and 34 years of age. The series is too far-fetched. There's no real reason why the FL Is able to go back in time. Also, the reason for the. ML's Suicide is not explained. He doesn't look depressed or unable to go on with Life in the first episode for him to suddenly leap off the balcony. If they knew each other from high school, why did he act as if he didn't really know who she was when she was in the wheelchair? The really high ratings are not really supported. It must be because of the ML's fan base. I've only watched the first episode, but it didn't really hold my interest.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"This one earns a 9.5/10 because of the acting and the chemistry. Honestly speaking, the plot would've gotten annoying if Kim Hye-yoon, Byeon Woo-seok, Lee Seung-hyub, and Song Geon-hee weren't able to pull it off. The chemistry between the whole cast is the success of this show. Of course, Kim Hye-yoon and Byeon Woo-seok deserve special mention as leads. They were 100% the right casting choices for the way the characters were written. If actors of lesser competency and chemistry had been chosen, I would've finished the show begrudgingly rather than enthusiastically.While I think the plot could've been different and just as entertaining, the writers and director still did an amazing job at creating such a fun and healing story.I would love to say I'm gonna find my own Ryu Sun-jae now, but I don't think a man like him exists.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Lovely Runner"" is a K-drama that excels in every aspect, from its unique storytelling and strong performances to its high production values and deep thematic content.

He deserves everything because he has been through so much in the acting industry. I loved his work. The movie had everything emotion, happiness, comedy, love, relation. It was beautiful. I hope to see something like this again in the future and I hope to see him in other movies because he's amazing, including the female lead.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Deciding to watch this drama on-going was the right decision. I started this drama because of THE Kim Hyeyoon and time travel is one of my favorite genres. The first ten minutes of the pilot episode managed to take me into a deep emotion when Im Sol lost her willing for life and then she got a glimmer of hope from Ryu Sunjae and it became the turn point of her life. Im Sol's life as a fangirl also makes me feel very familiar and relatable. The development of the story then made me feel like I was riding a roller coaster of emotions and the experience of watching this was like taking a trip to somewhere for the first time and I couldn't guess what they would give me next.Time travel back to school plot and first love stories are nothing new in East Asian dramas and I have watched quite a lot of similar stories before. However, this drama is able to give me all new feelings that I have never felt before from the same genre. This drama succeeds in presenting elements of comedy and also romance very well. The romance was conveyed so beautifully and it succeeded in making my heart flutters so many times, while the comedy succeeded in making me laugh out loud. Other elements, such as angst and the mixture of various existing tropes, are also mixed well which makes this drama so rich with flavors.The two main leads have very strong chemistry and each complements the other. Kim Hyeyoon is an actress with wide-range acting skill. She previously proved her ability in several roles. Here, she plays a quite complex role. From just one drama, she is able to convey various emotions in an extraordinary way. Kim Hyeyoon's strength in my opinion is that she can make her co-stars follow the same rhythm as her. Even though Byeon Wooseok is an actor who has previously shown his abilities in several roles, but perhaps this is his best role so far, especially in the romance genre. I also need to praise the director, because of his excellent works he's able to present Byeon Wooseok's microexpression so well. To play the main role in the romance genre, good synergy between the two main leads is very necessary. Kim Hyeyoon and Byeon Wooseok are a very matched couple that this drama successfully presents to the audience, so that we can feel what a romantic comedy should convey through the screen.Cannot be avoided, in the time travel genre it is difficult to avoid plot holes, especially if the episode length is limited. Actually, I hope there are several things that are explained more in this drama, but I don't think this is crucial because this genre is fantasy romcom, not a sci-fi. For me, that is not a weakness of this drama, because the main message this drama wants to convey is already delivered.When watching this drama on-going, I was very excited and also worried about the development of the plot, but thankfully until the latest episodes I was still able to really enjoy it, as I enjoyed it at the beginning. I am currently so grateful because I have found a good romcom drama again after a long time, but this also has a negative effect on me because after this it will be difficult to enjoy a similar genre for quite some time. Up until now, I have rewatched it for so many times, because rewatching this after the story develops further gives a stronger feeling.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

The OST is so good it keeps playing in my head over and over. The cast is perfect. They are all versatile. This show gave me a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Kim Hye Yoon never disappoints she act so well that you can't feel she's acting at all. It was so natural. She can make me laugh then cry after a moment. Byeon Woo Seok also matches the female lead's versatility. I really love his character in this drama. He portrayed his role so well. I am thankful that the actors who were supposed to play Ryu Seon Jae turned down the role because Byeon Woo Seok is destined for this role he nailed it and I can't imagine any guy playing the male lead aside from him. He looked like a real swimmer, actor and an idol. I just found out that he actually sang the song 'Sonagi (Sudden Shower)' like damn he's so talented what else can't he do? The concert part where he sang Sonagi is full of emotions the last time I got carried away with a song like this was Jung Yong Hwa's 'Because I missed you' in Heartstrings and to think he also sang it live?! How I wish there will be a real concert for Eclipse. They even have their own YT channel with all the OST of Eclipse. Byeon Woo Seok is a gem. His character is the greenest flag male lead I've ever seen in a drama. I hope they work again together in the future. The only thing I'm sad about is that this show has to end and I'm gonna miss my happy pill. Kudos to everyone who made this show a success. 💕",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"This drama absolutely don't deserve more than 7. Fangirls and fanboys can rate at 10 but that is not objectively. Only because you ""looove uwu"" an actor you can't give the entire series an astounding score. This drama is not so bad, I've seen worse. But don't have any originality. The many ""twist"" are absurd. The main actress is very annoying. She deserves the ""mean"" roles like snowdrop or sky castle. The good girl character don't fit on her because of her annoying voice and expressions. There is a plenty dramas to be a lot better but don't have so much high rate like this (ie hospital playlist, dr romantic). Don't waste your time in this drama if you hate cliches or predictable ""twist""",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Finally, a K-drama that truly gives me those lovey-dovey feelings! Sun Jae is absolutely adorable, and both actors deliver incredible performances that bring the story to life. Their chemistry is undeniable, making every scene feel genuine and heartfelt. The storyline is compelling and keeps you hooked from start to finish, filled with moments that make you laugh, cry, and cheer for the characters. The plot balances humor and romance perfectly, making it a delight to watch.What sets this K-drama apart for me is how relatable and down-to-earth the characters are. Sun Jae's charm is simply irresistible-his cute mannerisms and heartfelt expressions make you root for him throughout the series. His voice is another highlight, adding a layer of emotion and sincerity to his character that makes him unforgettable. The way he interacts with his love interest is natural and endearing, creating a romantic atmosphere that feels both refreshing and authentic.The OSTs are another standout element of this series. Each song is beautifully crafted, perfectly matching the mood of the scenes and enhancing the overall emotional impact. The music elevates the storytelling, making those romantic moments even more touching and memorable. It's rare to find a soundtrack that complements a drama so well, but this one nails it.This K-drama has quickly become my favorite, and I can't recommend it enough to fans of lighthearted, romantic series. It's the perfect escape from reality, offering a feel-good experience that leaves you with a warm heart. The writing is sharp, the direction is spot-on, and the pacing keeps you engaged throughout.If you're looking for a K-drama that will make you smile, laugh, and fall in love with the characters, this is the one to watch. It's the best I've seen in a long time, and Sun Jae's cuteness is just the cherry on top. His performance, along with the rest of the cast, makes this series a must-watch. Whether you're a longtime fan of K-dramas or new to the genre, this show is bound to steal your heart.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"Lovely Runner has captured my heart, and how! I can't get enough of it-I'm already watching it for the third time!What sets this drama apart is likely a combination of:* An unbelievably perfect cast!The cast is simply stellar! Kim Hye Yoon's portrayal of Im Sol is impeccable, especially in the comedic scenes. Her performance in the drunk and post-breakup scenes with Kim Tae Sang had me laughing out loud. Yet, she seamlessly transitions to handle serious moments with equal skill.Byeon Woo-seok brings Sun Jae to life in a way that's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. His portrayal convinces viewers of his love for Im Sol, evident in the way his eyes light up whenever she's present.* Excellent plotThe story goes beyond just time traveling and romance, delivering some profound messages. In one episode, Im Sol reflects on how we often miss important things while focusing on something else. That really resonated with me. Additionally, the idea that while some actions can change the future, others are destined to happen was beautifully woven into the series.The plot is tight with little to no loopholes. Any questions I had during my first viewing were answered in subsequent viewings. I encourage critics to watch the drama a second time if they have any issues with the plot. There are a few minor plot holes, but none are significant enough to detract from the drama.* Beautiful narrationI loved how the story was narrated from both Im Sol and Sun Jae's perspectives. I also appreciated seeing the second part of a scene first, followed by the events leading up to it. This is common in many dramas, but this show executed it with such finesse that it was easy to follow and provided those ""aha"" moments* Terrific supporting cast & side storiesMy favorites are Kim Tae Sang, Sol's mom, and Sun Jae's dad. They are amazing performers who added another dimension to the story, making it feel so real. I particularly enjoyed Tae Sang and Sol's interactions in her ""noona"" avatar. They were hilarious yet endearing. Sun Jae and Tae Sung's bromance and rivalry were equally delightful.What I didn't care much for was the side story about Sol's brother and her best friend. I fast-forwarded through most of their scenes. Also, in the last episode, I felt it was out of character for Sol to prioritize her aspirations over Sun Jae. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, but it didn't seem true to Sol's character. She and Sun Jae had waited their entire lives to be together, yet ""making a movie"" was more important to her than being with the love she thought she had lost. This didn't sit well with me.However, I'm willing to overlook this, given what an amazing experience watching the whole series has been!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"This has to be one of the best k-dramas I have ever watched. It made me laugh, made me cry - the female lead is an excellent actress, the male lead is bloody gorgeous and has great chemistry with the female lead, the story is original and full of lots of twists and turns, and more importantly, I loved the ending. Throughout, you are always rooting for the lead characters to get together properly. It's just a lovely romance to watch and I didn't want it to end. The actor who plays the male lead deserves his new found success and I look forward to watching him in other dramas. I may even have to watch this one again. Overall, 10/10!",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Imagine being able to go back and save someone who has saved you, by being your favorite idol/person... I would do it too, but that episode 2 plot twist at the end was really set the standard and we all knew how good the drama was going to be. The way it ties Im Sol & Ryu Sun-Jae's story in a much deeper level. Just wow! Also, gotta give it to my girl Kim Hye-yoon. SHE CARRIED THE DRAMA. Her acting is out of this world. I cried when she cried. I laughed when she laughed. Every one of her emotions were felt through the tv. Byeon Woo-seok, our handsome Sun-Jae, I mea, what a gorgeous man, and he acts and sings. What?!?! His and Hye-yoon's chemistry was a 10/10. It felt so real I just loved them. The casting was top tier. As for the rest of the cast, I loved and the story just felt so natural even with all the time travel and timelines over lapping, I loved it. And to finish my little review, Mr Taxi driver, why were you beefing with a couple of 20 year olds. Hahah. Please give LR a watch if you haven't. You will love it.

tt31324295,"Now that we have two remaining episodes left I'm already feeling sepanxx over this and will surely feel this way for few weeks. The last time I got hooked by Kdramas is the year 2016 - 2017 where Kdramas are truly perfection you can binge watch one after another. It's the time when Kdrama is at it's peak. Nowadays it's really hard to finish one I have so many pending Kdramas in my list and I can't seem to find my motivation to finish them but this came along and Lovely Runner ended my longing for a really damn good Kdrama. This drama gave me the same feeling once again, the thrill and excitement that I feel in every episode made me want to watch this in just one day. It's a masterpiece that I've been craving for so long. I am so happy that I finally watch this after ignoring this from my recommendation for so long and to every person who haven't watch this yet, you are missing out a lot. Lovely Runner may not be on Netflix and does not have the highest rating but you can clearly see it's popularity and how well received it is by the fans like me. If ever they decide to held a concert for the fictional band Eclipse, I bet the tickets would be sold out. The OST and cinematography is exquisite.

tt31324295,"I thought kdrama already forgot their romantic drama's hype. Yeah from 19 -24 few good story came. And this one is one of them. Undoubtedly this will be the best romantic kdrama of 24. The story was so good with a good ending.From the first episode this drama was not boring at all. Yeah there was too much climax in the story until 15 episode. But trust me without climax and thriller you will get bored. So in my opinion this story was top notch.Now talking about their acting, I know that female lead. She already did a same kind of drama may be (Extraordinary you). And she nailed it in both drama. Her nervous and sad face will kill you. So undoubtedly she is best for that kind of story. And about male lead, I never watched his drama. Even though his acting was not super cool for romantic drama, still he did his best. And their chemistry was super good.Actually all credit goes to this drama's story writer. He wrote a really good story. And their cast choosing was also good, specially they choosed perfect female lead for this type of story.

The actors/actresses were perfect in all of their roles and the chemistry between all of them was also perfect. I feel like the writers actually took their time to craft a beautiful story all the way to the very end. I truly appreciate that, especially since so many shows end up having rushed endings. I'm glad this one was not rushed. The music was beautiful too. Now, this is definitely one of my top favorite shows. It outshines the other popular shows that have come out this year.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"
tt31324295,"I want to say that a good looking face is not what makes a drama good... If you think that the FL is annoying because she is badly written... then great! I agree. If you think she is ""not good enough."" for the so called perfect ML then please reply to me so we can fight... A metric ton of these reviews REEK of misogyny. I don't understand how people can continuously dunk on the FL while praising the ML to death. BOTH are shallow and underdeveloped and still continue to be as of the most recent. Going off of the summary I thought I'd be getting an intelligent melodrama that touches on the struggles of fame, parasocial relationships and the viciousness of depression... maybe a little commentary on living with disabilities (since Sol was not disabled in the original story) but since EP 3 It's turned into a generic rom com with ANOTHER serial killer subplot that comes out of nowhere and Sol's disability has become non-existent. Yay proper representation and social commentary!Also the writers have made Im Sol annoying, unserious and illogical when it comes to her ""goal"". On the other hand Ryu Sun Jae is a boring paper cutout who also never feels like a real person. His existence revolves around the FL, every action he takes is in response to her and her feelings and he never manages to develop a solid character of his own. Swimming was Ryu Sunjae's whole life but he got over not being able to do it anymore super quick? Why? Because he likes Im Sol? Once again I could imagine a better show showing the ML struggling under the weight of possibly being a disappointment or just dealing with pressure at a very young age , which could have naturally led into exploring his depression. I don't feel anything because nothing feels earned... I need more than pretty faces for a drama to be a 10/10. The amount of people who are saying this show is PERFECT makes me feel like I'm in the twilight zone. It's not as bad as More than Friends but this is not going to be a memorable masterpiece like last year's Twinkling Watermelon or My Dearest.It's trying so hard to be Twinkling Watermelon without attempting to do any of the heavy lifting.

tt31324295,"When i first saw the poster of this drama i thought this is gonna be another teenage drama slice of life story but when i saw the teaser it's definitely not. I am a kpop fan myself and i can really relate to the female lead. This drama showcase every fan's genuine love for their kpop idol. This drama is really interesting it transformed the original manhwa in profound way. They retained the part where the male lead died and his fan time traveled to save him but the story is way too different from the manhwa. I loved how they change the plot in the drama where the female and male lead past are intertwined where we thought that Im Sol was the first to fall for Sun Jae but the truth is it's the other way around. He fell first and fell harder as time goes by. I can also relate to Sun Jae's dilemma of liking someone from afar. Some people may think that Sun Jae's falling for Im Sol just because of the umbrella scene is shallow but for me it's not. It's always the simple things and sincere gestures that matters. They were teenagers for godsake. Who didn't experience the joy of puppy love? She was his first love and who are we to question that? He didn't even got the chance to confess his love for her due to tragic accident that caused her disability and hate for him which she forget then later on we found out that the accident is an attempted murder after all. Ryu Seon Jae in the manhwa died in the beginning due to overdose of his medicine somewhat suicide but in the drama we also thought that he took his life but in fact he was murdered by the serial killer he was pushed from the balcony of his home. Then we get to see the female lead futile multiple attempts in changing their past to alter the future. There are certain scenes that they could have prevented if only Im Sol trusted Sun Jae such as the part where they parted on the train scene I was kinda frustrated with Im Sol that time she should have went home with them to prevent her altered future from happening. She's kinda impulsive at some point and make irrational decisions. I wished they made Im Sol's character not this reckless with faulty memories and make her trust Sun Jae instead of always pushing him away and confuses him with her behavior. Kim Hye Yoon is a top tier actress and I think she deserves to play a role of a female lead with rational choices. But overall this drama is so good that there's no boring episode it will make you binge watch this the whole day. This is one of the best romcom drama I've ever seen there's no corny jokes at all. This will give you all the feels heartbreak, nostalgia, frustrations, excitement, euphoric happiness and etc. The romantic scenes are not cringy at all it's so natural chemistry is chef's kiss they're like a match made in heaven. Even the OSTs are perfect you can listen to them nonstop. Their choice for the member of Eclipse band is perfect too. Their visuals and talent as a band is really giving. Byeon Woo Seok as Ryu Sun Jae is the probably the best choice the producers made. The production for this drama was delayed for three years due to actors declining the male lead role but I can say that it's for the best. They found the perfect embodiment of Ryun Sun Jae in Byeon Woo Seok. It's been a really long since the last time I got emotionally invested in a Kdrama. Lovely Runner will always have a soft spot in my heart. This drama made me realize that Mondays isn't very bad at all.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Serial couples are very close.Soul is very cute and despite his many misdeeds, I think he is one of the logical characters in the story.Sonjeh has a proud personality and when he secretly laughs, I really laugh.Even though they go back to the future in episodes 7 and 8, but none of them change, Soul is still as cute and Sonje is secretly enjoying it.Soul's friend is also really funny and the friends of the serial couples are one of the humorous points of the story.Sonje's father, who is no longer heard of, really made me laugh, especially in the part where the antenna was sticking out of his pants or when he fell from the table., the series is saying that a small decision and movement of yours in the past overshadows a large part of your future and it is really worth considering.In my opinion, filming; stage design; Serial songs; Actors play; The design of the clothes and everything up to this point was great.I hope that the serial couple will finally get together and Woo Suk will not die like in other movies and series.I hope it has a happy ending.And that I really like Sonje to understand what Soul is trying to keep alive.",positive,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

His voice is also beautiful, I'm in love with Sudden Shower, i can't believe he can really sing then at the scene of eclipse concert while Sunjae was singing sudden shower was different, I just cried because it was so melancholic when he sang. If only they could have a concert as if I could watch if ever bwahahaha.

Bound on a wheelchair the thirty-something lost her ticket and was forced to enjoy the show from outside of the auditorium. Her agony vanishes as she meets the star on her way home. But was it their first time meeting?Ever since its inception, the love of Im Sol and Sun Jae has undergone more changes than the weather itself. Im Sol who has been fangirling over Sun Jae finds him as her next-door neighbor as she travels back to 2009. Seeing her dead K-pop star alive makes her feel alive again and the chaotic love story begins.Attempting to time travel love is not a big thing for Korean dramas. The list is endless, from Scarlett Heart Ryeo to Go Back Couple, to recently ended Marry My husband.Then, why Lovely Runner is creating so much hype:1. The timelineSol is not living in a fixed time zone. She has travelled through various time of her life, while looking for ways to save Sun Jae. Some time, she is living for few months and sometime she is living for few days. It is like a staycation and not a total shift to that time zone.2. Differences in charactersCharacters are different. Modern Sol is polar opposite of her eighteen year old self. In fact, as she is going back to modern time, her cackling eighteen year old self is coming back. Sun Jae is not aware, so his character is not facing any transition in the process.3. Constant changesIt is very important to keep audience hooked. Monotonous storyline make audience wander whether to watch the next episode or not. However, in this story, the suspense is getting bigger with the magic of time travelling. Whether Sol will have her feet or Sun Jae will live...the answer is still uncertain.The story deserves an extra credit for giving space to additional characters of the story.The new arc of character of Seo Hye Won and Song Ji Ho not only add humor to the tale but also add perfect love dose in the story of Sol and Sun Jae. As the story grows, not only love blooms but the threat intensifies. Now a days, Korean dramas loses track after the twelfth episode, but lovely runner ahs successfully kept the charm and suspicion alive. The future of the endearing couple is still behind clouds. Song Geon Hee in the role of sweet and savory Tae Sung has got little to do. The second lead got back seated by the shine of Byeon Woo seok. The director should have drew his role in a better light. His bromance with Sun Jae looked warm but is not creating goosebumps. We still miss our Jun Pyo and Ji Hoo. The supporting cast including well known ajumma and ajusshis are brilliant in their shoes but it is Im Sol and Sun Jae who are eating the cream in chunks.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Music"

Like the mystery/revenge wasn't executed well and the ending was super underwhelming. The romance was also bad, like they would insert past clips of the female lead and second male lead, for what? To make us like them?, because they were both terrible people to be honest and dull.Every actor besides Lee Chaemin also looked lifeless. Literally no emotion. The only good thing about this show is maybe the visuals, but tbh even with the good looking actors, it still sucks.Don't watch this show. It's a waste of time. Only the 1st episode was decent and then it went downhill fast.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

I also liked Lee chaemin acting Even though it's my first time watching his drama. Even though I found big gaps in the drama, the scriptwriter tried to close the gaps, even if it was ridiculous, towards the end. We saw a new murder at the end of the series, but I don't think I will watch it if there is a second season. The first season was enough for me for now. This is my first review, I will continue to write from now on.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"You'd expect it to be full of drama and revenge plots, but it's not. The first few episodes were interesting because the drama was starting to show the chaos around Jooshin High due to the elite students' lifestyles and personalities. It got boring the more episodes I watched. The ending felt rushed; just a complete lackluster. The plot was so flat. I remember Kang Ha saying ""I'm just getting started"" at the LAST episode. He got so distracted with Jae-I and it seemed like he forgot the real reason he went to Jooshin High. He didn't even do a proper investigation. I got the points of friendship and the struggle of each student but the ending didn't feel right. I only liked Rian's development due to Jae-I's influence, but even then he didn't get a punishment for all he's done. He was still a normal student in Jooshin High.Overall, props and cinematography is good. Characters are meh, storyline was had no depth. If it was food, I'd say it's good pasta with tap water as a sauce.It was disappointing. It could've been better.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

I feel like kang ha didn't actually get justice because all the rich kids were able to live happy lives. This show didnt satisfy me at all. Jae-i is the only one who wasn't really a part of the bullying but she got the worst of it, its honestly not fair. And the reviews saying kang ha is in the wrong for liking her, they didn't even watch the show. Woojin was also missing for half the show and didnt receive any consequences for his actions, but i guess revealing evidence to the police counts?? Honestly the writing is also meh but it was such an entertaining watch. Idk why the hate is so extreme lmao.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I debated about giving this an 8/10, but settled on 7/10 because the story just wasn't credible, and some of the acting just wasn't good. The setting is a prestigious school Nobless Oblige where those at the top enjoy privileges through money and title but also by sometimes cruelly enforcing a pecking order, especially of the scholarship students who struggle just to get through a day without harassment and bullying. One actor, who played the leading scholarship-student role-Lee Chae-Mim as Kang ha-deserves a 9/10 for his portrayal of the avenging, fraternal-twin brother, who accepted a scholarship to the school motivated solely by uncovering what happened at that school that led up to and included his brother's death, which had been shamefully covered up. I found myself really rooting for him throughoutt. It was so satisfying to see him so confidently stand up to and outwit the bullies who had so tormented his brother. He also does a great job of bringing out the best in those around him, which even though it felt somewhat unbelievable, his character remained flawlessly consistent and believable. It's well worth watching, and I should mention that despite some fair acting and scriptwriting, the filmmaking and soundtrack were very good.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

tt27763561,"At 30 reviews, this drama has quite a bimodal distribution. The boy does not get the girl. The killing is an accident. The revenge, at least in first season, is not fully executed. It seems more of a story of redemption, up to the final scene after the credits, where it looks like the villain and the hero might actually trade places in season 2. Overall, a refreshing plot that breaks some mainstream expectations. I liked the maturity represented. I like how some characters come to a place of maturity. The real villains seem the parents, and only working class are really punished, the teacher (presumably prison, and the principal, fired).

The revenge is all gone and it jst sticks with stupid romance and girl ends up with the boy who bullied his brother then what about his brother death. Waste of time don't watch it.

There was nothing wrong with it and I have no reasons to not give it 10 stars.

tt27763561,"Well, it was fun I would say but it just feels soooooo empty of everything. The emotions? The relationships? Many things you just cannot connect with.So my Ian problem was the revenge for his brother. A poor boy who was bullied and then killed. I mean the actor did good job ( kinda?) portraying the angry twin brother HOWEVER, He is defending a girl who was one of the main reasons why his brother got bullied and instead of feeling anger and hate he is simply simping over her and keep asking her why she is not choosing him ( like boy aren't you here for your dead brother wth r u doing?). Also in the last episodes when she confessed ( I killed him), his response was weird. I don't know but that quick love between these two characters was very very weirdAnother thing is how easy was the revenge thing. Like went to the police and what? Where is the revenge man. I don't know but disappointing and the bullies deserved much more. Why they are showing us their cute lovely friendship moments while trying to show them as ""nice people"". Idc what anyone says about these characters but they are awful people. A little ""story"" is not enoughLastly, the stupid love triangle. The girl is deeply in love with her boyfriend but at the end she says she felt something towards the guy? Huh? And at that villa why she told him she felt that kiss too? I am sorry I am confused ?????In general story was very good at the beginning but it got very random. I didn't like any character also.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,It started soooo strong. So full of potential. I was thinking the glory. The first 3 episodes where great. You are guessing. The female lead was annoying. Hot-cold. But I think it was just the character. Just spoiled rich kids. And even the poor kids are spoiled horrible human beings.I do get it. Everything in this drama is caused by bad bad parenting. And adults being worse then the kids. No wonder they go adrift.As soon as the mystery dropped. The show went downhill.There was no fulfilling revenge. It was meh.The acting was at some scenes on point.They are hinting at a second season but I really don't know if this is just an open ending or if there will be a second season. I don't know If I'm watching. Maybe just to know who killed. And why.6/10 some good scenes and I did like the lead character searching revenge. A drama to watch for beauty.,negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"The background of the kdrama is nothing new. Rich kids in high school screwing around, and someone is revenging. Cliche aside, this story is garbage. The main character ran into the school and broadcasted to everyone that he's trying to revenge his victim brother, and the guy doesn't even have a plan to execute his revenge. He conveniently found a guy with some info he could use against the bullies, and he gather everyone to go against the bullies without any resistance. Everyone just agreed to standup against the bullies together. If it was that easy, why do we even need the main character? And why hasn't anyone tried yet? The best of all is that the main character kept saying he's got a plan, and he's got more revenge to come. And then the show ended. Where are your plans?! You did like 3 things!

In all combined it's just so confusing and unnecessary. So many details were omitted.Second, actors. All act poorly - at least male lead and some leading actors were okay.

They lure you in with, what should be, a really good revenge/mystery plot but give you a story that's dull and not well written. The actors did the best they could with what they were given and how they were directed, so I can't fault them. With the exception of Lee Chae-Min, I found the others needed more guidance in their portrayals as they seemed like lifeless puppets reciting lines. No emotions really, their eyes remained blank. Plus, sorry gentlemen but the only character I found intimidating was played by Choi Won-Young. The story is too fast paced as well, revealing things way too soon without proper foundation, like the writer kept coming up with last minute ideas and implemented them before solidifying their base in the story. One last thing, I felt the whole 'love' storyline between the 2 top rich students was both unnecessary and emotionless.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

tt27763561,"The synopsis of the hierarchy system in elite school setting like jooshin high school is to be expected. Personally I liked the character Rian, who is the richest most powerful character in the series. They made him out to be the antagonist of the series but he's actually a good guy. They paint him to be the bad guy because his followers carry out beatings and stuff on his behalf but he never orders any of it. Her us another interesting character because they paint her to be a bad person but she has a soft heart (especially after she breaks down crying after she told jaei that they were never friends). Jae-i's character was made to be the weakest imo because she is from one of the wealthiest families but they made her out to be weak and had most of the burden on her shoulders alone. She easily could have told her bf RI-an and he could have handled everything himself but they let her be weak on her own. The protagonist of the show Kang-ha does not make sense because his twin brother was weak and a target of bullying but somehow he is the exact opposite and strong enough to oppose the bad rich kids. Thought that was a bad representation of his character. Hope there is a stronger 2nd season because they can do so much better.",neutral,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"A big budget, beautiful actors and sceneries, and nice cars could not propel this KDrama to the level of others that share the same tropes.

Other characters- awesome opportunities to explore how they could have pushed the plot, but didn't.Unnecessary parents- did not impact or improve anything.Avenge your brother-period. Nope. Let's ""change the school's culture"". Unrealistic outcomes based on a lackluster plot and mediocre acting.Romance? Let's race to see if we stay together (Boys over Flowers vibes). They tried to have a triangle, but that failed.The ""blackmail"" idea became tiresome by the end. This could have been so awesome with some twists.The biggest letdown, IMO, were the underdeveloped relationships, irrelevant flashbacks, and overall failure to launch (all over the place).Watch it.

I cannot express how good hierarchy is, it's just something you must see for yourself. From the cast to the plot and even the OSTs, it is perfect in my humble opinion. Without a doubt one of my favourites this year. Thats why i was initially flabbergasted as to why the overall ratings are so unbelievably low. I could really go in depth about every detail of hierarchy but just know that once you start watching episode 1 you will find yourself binging it until the end. I will be eagerly awaiting a season two as soon as possible.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I just finished watching Hierarchy on Netflix without even seeing the trailer beforehand. Based on the series poster, I suspected it would be the Korean version of Gossip Girl, Elite, and Pretty Little Liars. After watching it, my initial impression remains unchanged. The plot is predictable, and the twists were not surprising.Set in Jooshin High School, the most prestigious school in South Korea, the series follows the lives of elite students who are chosen at birth to attend. These include Jeong Jae Yi, the first daughter of the Jaeyool Group; Kim Ri An, the successor of the Jooshin Group; Yoon He Ra, the youngest daughter of a trading company; and Lee Woo Jin, the second son of a powerful political family. In contrast, the poorer students are portrayed as content, wise, cheerful, and grounded.The story takes a turn when Kang Ha transfers to Jooshin High School. Behind his innocent smile lies a secret that threatens to unravel the entire establishment. As typical of high school/teen suspense dramas, the protagonist from a poor background faces bullying from the wealthy students, who are linked to a mysterious death. The teachers and administrators turn a blind eye to the privileged students' bad behavior. The series also delves into the imperfect family lives of the rich students, highlighting the pressures of maintaining reputations, inheriting businesses, and dealing with envy.While Hierarchy isn't disappointing, it also isn't exceptional. The storytelling isn't seamless and at times feels forced. However, there are several redeeming qualities. The production values are impressive, with every shot looking expensive and meticulously designed. The cinematography is stunning, with flawless color grading and cinematic visuals. The background music is catchy and perfectly conveys the emotions of each scene.Overall, Hierarchy is a decent, time-pass drama. It's not a waste of time, but it doesn't stand out either. If you enjoy western teen dramas like Elite, you might find this series enjoyable. Just don't go in with high expectations.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"The first chapter is promising but after that is in a non stop decline. Slow paced, unnecessarily, and with an inconsistent plot.A lot of sighs and time of reflection in silence from the characters that make the time pass super slow. The parents of the students are very cartoonish, not very credible.It could be better managed in terms of mystery and tension. The story resolves in a very boring way and everyone is ridiculously redeemed. The bad people is not that bad by the end, the good people forgive kind of easily and all end happy. Absurd. It was a murder and abuse story and you have the feeling it was not important after all. Don't watch it, don't make my mistake.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"As an avid viewer, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on ""Hierarchy."" The low ratings and negative comments have truly irked me, especially when some critics seem to miss the mark entirely.Firstly, let's address the naysayers who label the show as ""predictable."" Frankly, they likely didn't exercise the patience to watch the post-credits scene. Surprise plot twists abound, catching even the most seasoned viewers off guard. Trust me, no one saw that coming!Comparing ""Hierarchy"" to other K-dramas like ""The Heirs"" or ""The Glory"" is an apples-to-oranges situation. This show stands in a class of its own. It doesn't mimic or strive to be anything else-it's an original narrative, distinct and refreshing.Now, the revenge storyline. Critics who dismiss it as ""bad"" miss the point entirely. Just because it didn't unfold precisely as they envisioned doesn't render it terrible. The storytelling approach is unique, weaving threads of suspense and intrigue.WATCH!!!! SO GOOD!!! 😉🎬",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Why in the heck did I watch all 7 episodes in this (thankfully) short series? It started off really interesting but it lost me somewhere around episode 3 1/2. I guess I kept watching because I thought that at least some of the monstrously entitled characters: Jae-Ri, Kim Ri-An and their coterie of sycophants would somehow CONVINCINGLY tranform into better human beings. But that never happened. And the one decent character, Kang Ha just got less interesting because of his joke of a dumb crush on a girl with the allure of a designer doormat. The finale/Episode 7 was the worst episode of all. A coda of inconsequential duhhh-like-we-didn't-know-all-this-already moments, hollow mea culpas and the obligatory throwing of a posse of nobodies under the bus. Our series' unloved hero, Kang Ha just fades into the background while the 2 characters (who I couldn't stand) take over the series' final scenes. Side notes: Jae-Ri is disturbingly weak both physically and mentally, yet still manages to be consistently imperious around her sassy so-called best friend. How Kang Ha fell in love with her at first sight was unfathomable-unless maybe in Korea it's normal to worship ice queens with blank stares. And why did the drama feature most of the rich kid's parents but scholarship student KangHa is presented like some parentless possibly homeless nobody from nowhere? I sort of wondered if it would turn out that this was a clue that Kang Ha wasn't real- that he was a revenging ghost figure. (Think Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider.) Now that would have been a worth sticking around for twist. And Yo Netflix! Don't order another season of Hierarchy unless you can fire the Season 1 writers. They totally dropped the ball.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"The show is complicated, captivating, reflective, and overall good.I love that the story isn't that plain and obvious (the guy comes and has revenge for his brother's killers/bullies) in this show there are complicated relationships and complicated circumstances of the death of his brother. There is a question of love between teenagers, there is an empowerment journey. Every character has its journey, dilemmas, and questionable actions.I love a good revenge story (The Glory is one of my favorites if not the favorite show on that subject), but this is more of a story where one guy disrupts everyone's perfect lives.There is a scared girl who will take life into her own hands, there is an insecure girl who will find her way, and there is a bad guy whom no one should love but he receives the love, there is the hurt guy without any fear with only shir determination but with a good heart, there is secret love, there are scared followers.A lot of people questioned the ending and this is my thoughts on this...
There should have been more consequences and that is my criticism of the show.I would have made one more episode because the last one is all over the place, and I would include revenge victory where we can see guilty parties suffer the consequences.I don't want to spoil some things so I will not get into it more.The ending could have been better, but it's good enough if they make season 2 to clarify and improve some things. I think that story is worth it.And that is why the show should have more than a 7.1 but less than a 7.6 rating overall in my opinion.If there was a better ending I would argue that the rating should be around 8.4..10 isn't the right rating but I gave it to this show because I saw that few people gave it a 1, 2, or 3,4 (which is stupid on its own), and a 6.1 rating overall doesn't do its justice. This show is good and the right rating should be more than 7.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

His mood is souring each day with his tumultuous relation with Ji Ae. Enters a student with scholarship - Mr. Ha.Reasons to watch the drama1. The first thing which will work is the plot. Watching a thriler is always fun. And here thriller has been served right.2. Fresh chemistry: Chemistry does not lie within leads only. The performance observed between characters in charge of pulling the story must align well which is identified in the story.3. Performance delivered by actors have been terrific.

They infact harbour bullies in school more than in other place.2. Well know theme makes the story predictable at many places.

tt27763561,"I quite enjoyed the drama and it is not clear why it is condemned and it receives such bad reviews, it is a bit like an American drama, it is true, after all, it is a Netflix production. I don't understand why the viewers should compare it to other dramas. I think that beyond the plot, (which is not bad at all) there are some difficult social criticisms in it, concerning the humiliating attitude of parents towards their children, the humiliating attitude of the rich towards the poor, the humiliating attitude of teachers towards students and the humiliating attitude of students towards students (and this is seen in many Korean dramas. They all bring everyone to the edge of their mental endurance.Maybe because I am also a mother of twins, the story touched a sensitive chord with me. ..it's also not clear why Netflix doesn't mean that in episode 7 after the subtitles there is another and very significant section for the end of the series ..that many viewers don't notice and think that the drama ends with the leading woman arriving at her mother's house?? The series had a great soundtrack, the actors were great...all in all, not a bad drama at all and since Netflix defined it as a ""limited series"", I guess there is no second season and it's a shame, because it was left with another murder that you can hardly understand who was murdered (perhaps on purpose) and the end open, and has the good man become the bad man?",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Where do I start here. This was the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time watching this. This story is about the lead actor going supposedly undercover to expose the school because his brother died of a supposed car accident. The problem here is that he tells practically everyone what he is going to do. How dumb is that. Then he can't even defend himself. Why then does he act so tough when he can't back it up. Then they flash back to when his brother gets hit by the car and the culprit is the hot teacher who was messing around with the other student. The dead student actually got what he deserved. If you noticed the only ones getting bullied was the friend that tried to help the male lead, the principals son and the male lead. The other scholarship students did what they had to and weren't bothered too much, so why didn't the brother do the same? What business of it was his to get upset that the hottie teacher was getting it on with the male student in the staircase. She was even nice to him. I really don't understand who wrote this garbage. In the end the male lead gives the police the video evidence and the responsible person goes to jail and then he becomes friendly with the bullies and that is the end. As for the casting of this crap. He-Ra should have been the lead instead of the other actress. She is more attractive and has a better way of carrying herself. The only reason I kept watching this is because of her and the hottie teacher and also hoping that this would get better. Unfortunately it did not. Netflix please Do not renew this garbage !!!

tt27763561,"This had SO MUCH potential to be a great revenge series like The Glory and those kind of H. S bullying revenge shows. Episode 1-3 was great, 9/10, but 4-7? What even. The revenge was so unsatisfying. The bullies deserved to be punished, Ri-an especially. Also, WE DONT CARE ABOUT THOSE COUPLES (rian and jae). We wanted a great revenge for Kang Ha's brother!!!! Why didnt they suffer as much?! Kang Ha was shown max like 10 minutes. He couldve been so cool if be actually did some revenge. That teacher's little BF shouldve been in juvy or smthn?? He helped cover up murder for god's sake. The principal's son had more personality and more determination to do revenge and he wasnt even THAT affected by bullying????

tt27763561,A young man (In Han) on a scholarship to an elite school is bullied unmercifully and gets run over and killed whilst running away from said bullies.His fraternal twin brother (Kang Ha) enters the same school on a scholarship to hunt down and punish those responsible.Of course he meets a girl (Jai I) and forms a crush on her. She has recently broken up with the leader of the school bullies (Ri-an) and she won't tell him why.This reason turns out to be so illogical and unnecessary - not to mention unfair - that you can only sigh when it is revealed.The story continues (I won't say progresses) with scenes of rich kids beating up poor kids and examples of discrimination and unfairness whereby there are certain rooms reserved for the rich which the poor can't enter - they have to wear different ties etc.Eventually Kang Ha finds out what happened to his brother - and very late in the day - who was responsible for his death. Of course there is the inevitable hateful parents who treat their children as commodities. Jae-I's dad (the excellent Choi Won Young) is a major bad guy in this.The story is weak and derivative - the young actors have not had much experience and it shows. They are mainly passionless and expressionless in equal measure. It was oddly uninvolving and the ending was a total let-down. Being a Kdrama connoisseur no review would be complete without mentioning what they are most famous for - the kisses !! There were precious few of them and that was probably a blessing because they were very very poor. There was very little chemistry between Jai. I and Ri-an - Jai-I in particular looked barely conscious throughout the entire series.It is such a shame that Studio Dragon seems to be struggling with it's writers these days - and bigger stars seem to be avoiding them.With this level of output - I am not surprised.,negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

It wasn't lingering at all.

...
The bullying shown in this drama is something I have seen many time before in Kdramas and is quite prevalent in South Korea's schools and colleges.The show's story screams how much it is influenced by spanish drama ""Elite"". All the bullying, sex, drugs, filthy rich morons and their brats, parties, pregnancy ..... just reminded me of it.It is another disappointment after ""The Impossible Heir"" although the acting is goo didn't even want to give this drama one star. The female lead character is terrible, and her acting is so bad. She hasn't done anything other than give cold stares to everyone. Her dialogues are not at all powerful as they should be.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

If you're gonna criticise the show, at least properly finish the series first. Don't believe the people saying that this show is 'predictable' because chances are they wasn't even patient enough to watch the post credits scene. I know damn well no one expected that plot twist. Now, the people who are comparing hierarchy to other shows like 'the heirs' or 'the glory' are just invalid because you can't compare this to another K-drama. It's not copying or trying to be this or that, hierarchy is it's own original story and is literally a class of its own. Im sick of critics saying that this was a bad revenge story. Just because it didn't go how you wanted it to, doesn't mean you can sit there and say it's terrible. The story telling was unique and the only bad aspect of this show that I can think of is it's only seven episodes long and I can't wait for season two, which will be even better than the first season by a lot and then people will shut up and realise that this show is goated. If you are still deciding whether or not to watch hierarchy then just go for it, it's shorter than most K-dramas on netflix so there's nothing to lose.

The acting is extremely poor, with everyone overacting to the point where it feels like a high school play. Every scene is exaggerated to the max, making it all seem overly dramatic and unrealistic. The plot, what little I saw of it, was unengaging and cliché. Even as a background show while doing other things, it's just too grating to endure. Save your time and skip this one.

It just a little more plot and add he-ra and woojin as the main character and I'm down to recommend all of my friends to watch it.Please ignore all the hate comments, I'm sure you guys can fix it by giving us season 2, you guys have so much potential, LITERALLY ALL THE CAST ARE GOLD (especially Ji Hye-won and Lee Won-jung, I ship them so much), the plot just need a revision tbh, the rommance needed revision as well, WHY CANT WOOJIN AT LEAST BE WITH HE-RA?",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"Another average high school drama about bullying, tangled relations, hierarchy and what not? I'm here for it!I am guilty of liking this overused genre a lot, and there are a few dramas that are actually pretty impressive. But this is definitely not it. And one of the major reason being v poorly written characters.Overall portrayal of a lot of characters was just flawed and conflicting towards the end.1. Jae I - I seriously don't understand why was she so unnecessarily secretive about the blackmail and pregnancy stuff. Why did she just disappear and ignore ri an like that and come up with break up out of nowhere? Like this is just so insane that guy would literally turn the world upside down for the girl why act so helpless??And what was that in the end did she like two men at the same time? Umm excuse me?!2. Ri an - other than the fact that the actor was really bad with his expressions, I just did not find his character v impactful.3. He ra - omg she has gotta be one of the most confusing characters everrr. Like from the start it seems she is super jealous of jae i. But the ending made them seem so full of love and all. Like hello? A girl that deceives you to get your man? Nope she can never be a friend. Just ridiculous. Also are we just gonna pretend she was not a bully at all? Why was she not questioned at all.4. Kang ha - even though he seemed the most normal of all, I just did not like his chemistry with the FL. I mean I did like them together initially but after going through jae i and ri an' s past, kang ha did not really fit in the picture. Also he seemed kinda goal oriented so confessing to jae i at the end was not really needed when you know how much she loves ri an. But what's even wilder is she implied she liked him briefly like whatt?Just a v complicated- unnecessary- spiced up drama filled plot that you're better off sleeping on. Honestly, would not recommend.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"It was really good, many valid problems of each character showed how vulnerable people are.Jae-i was expressionless the entire show, but she had a rough past. I found He-ra slightly annoying when I first watched it, she had all the wrong thoughts about her best friend. Kang Ha proctecting Jae-i is cute though, he has an amazing personality whose willing to stand up for her. In-han's story is so unfortunate, his journey in Jooshin High School just highlights how bad bullying can be. Ri-an on the other hand, he wasn't exactly my favorite. He used his power of an own personal gain. So far cool series.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,I honestly got bored after the 1st episode. It just wasn't my type of show. I feel like the writing could have been done better but honestly I wouldn't discourage others from watching. Even though I didn't enjoy the show doesn't mean you will too. It might be your niche. Overall I felt as it was too much romance and not enough satisfying revenge scenes. Or the main lead going up against the bullies and having a proper back and fourth. It felt far from what the trailer was portrying. It made it seem it was going to be a good revenge plot but i guess it was a romance from the get go as thay is what the genre said on netflix and google. Still i reccomend others to give it try and judge for yourself maybe you will like it : ),negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I had high expectations for this drama but was left extremely disappointed. This is a high school bullying trope similar to The Glory - which was amazing. However, this was extremely underwhelming and unsatisfying. If you like watching bullying shows with little to no consequence for the bullys - this is for you. Was highly upset that they were also romanticizing a very toxic and abusive relationship. Very bland romance, no moments of justice and no character development. The ONLY good thing about this was the actor who played Kang Ha. Go watch The Glory instead it's the same concept but beautifully written and very satisfying.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"It's obvious a second season will be coming after that ending - I hope everyone was patient with the credits to see the actual final little bit at end. So who did it? The ML and his TXT at the end with his sinister smile - more mystery to solve. I personally loved this series. It was full of mystery, romance, society's class problems, family problems, egos, revenge, selfishness, action and more. The actors did a great job; yes they were a bit cold as some might call it - was waiting for the FL to soften up a little bit along the way and she did smile one or twice near the end but she always kept that coolness pretty much throughout which is part of the character due to her suffering so much alone with what happened to her and what her father puts her through as well. All in all 7 episodes is easy and fun to watch and also an odd number for a K-Drama which is another reason am expecting more.",positive,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,The drama started of well. The first episode was interesting. But as the drama Continued it became soo booring . The characters were soo bad . If it was a proper revenge drama or romance it would have been good. But it has nothing. From episode four it was soo bad that i just skipped to the end(cuz I don't stop a drama before finishing it) The max rating I could give is 3/10 only cuz of some scenes of friendship. This drama literally had no sense. Started like a revenge then went to romance and ending in nothing. I would never recommend this to anyone.

tt27763561,"I don't watch a huge number of K-Dramas, but some of them are amazingly compelling. I just binged through this in 2 days and I'm ready for season 2.It was billed as ""The Glory"" levels of revenge and I didn't feel that vibe at all. Maybe because they were all still in high school, and it wasn't revenge that had been plotted for years. It just felt a lot less intense.And less intense isn't bad. Scenes in The Glory were painful to watch and I was constantly tense... I didn't feel that with this so I could just relax and blow through it.I found myself not really hating anyone. The characters were all sad and complicated in their own way, even the bullies. I wanted to hate the rich kids, but then they show us their vulnerable parts and instead of hating them, I just wanted to shake them until they stopped being jerks.I also didn't really love anyone. I did like Kang Ha and Jae-i and I rooted for both of them. What Jae-i went through explained a lot about her, but we never, even when she was alone, really saw any emotion from her which made it hard to connect.The big thing for me was that the resolution of the mystery felt anti-climactic. It sort of seemed like Kang Ha had decided who was to blame and even when he learned the truth (or most of it) he didn't really change his track.But I will definitely watch season 2.

The dialogue was so on the nose starting maybe ep 3-4, I just started fast-forwarding. The episodes felt increasingly cringey and incoherent in ep 5-7.

The suspense and the end to it was satisfactory.The two male leads are the saving grace of this show. In my opinion they're not great actors yet, still young and raw, but they're okay enough to carry a show.The female lead playing Jung Jae I needs to eat something.

tt27763561,"Good thing this series as only 7 episodes. A scholarship kid infiltrates an elite school to avenge his brother's death. There isn't a lot of story and they were resorting to repeats to fill in the gaps. There was a sombre sanctimonious tone that weighed down the show. Some humor would have helped along the way to balance the bullying. Takes itself too seriously. Also the characters are too one dimensional. Rich kids are bad, poor kids are good. Adults are all morally bankrupt and wrong. As a result there is no emotional connection with any of the characters which is unusual for K dramas. Most makjang soaps and family dramas have more of an immediate connection with the characters that keeps you glued to the screen. Even Gossip Girl initially had humor and endearing characters that made it engaging. Maybe because of the shallowness of Hierarchy the show is a relaxing undemanding watch and so it proved to be a big hit globally.The production is quite glossy with slick photography and lots of fancy cars. The school building looked anything but.Leading actress Roh Jeong-Eui is very pretty here. She has lost a shocking amount of weight from her previous roles in 18 Again and Kill It. Almost unrecognizable. She plays this unhappy looking person for most of the show with occasional flashbacks of laughter. Kim Jae Won as her love interest played the young version of a character in Our Blues. He tries hard to do the rich kid but somehow he isn't that believable. He might have been better as the scholarship kid. If you compare to Lee Min Ho in Inheritors you will see there is a quality missing. In fact the cast does suffer in comparison to Inheritors where the charisma of the stars just spoke for themselves. The supporting cast Ji Hye Won and Lee Won Jung are not quite attractive enough for this kind of glossy show. The older generation are well cast. Yoon Se Ah is a welcome presence as the mother of the rich guy. The scholarship student played by Lee Chae Min looks a bit like an actor Cha Hak Yeon who played an evil guy in another series so it's hard to be on his side. Somehow didn't sympathize with his character. Mostly the writer's fault.The conclusion was fairly complete by K drama standards. Too many tears. The fact is the two rich leads weren't really that bad so all their apologizing felt a bit off. After all they didn't actually case the death. It wasn't a rich person at all who killed him. At the end there is an epilogue that paves the way for season 2 but frankly I don't think I would be interested in another season of this miserable lot. This show is no Inheritors for sure and that's not saying much.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"I lost 7 hours. The FL character doesn't make sense, she has no personality, she is just there, always looking emotionless. Plus she almost does nothing. I never really understood who she liked.The main problem I had with this drama is that a lot of things are incoherent. From one episode to the other a character changes totally: for example He-ra wanting to ruin her friend and suddenly remembering their friendship in another episode . At the end It seems like she totally forgot that she liked Ri-an and that was she was doing all of that. And don't even get me started on the last episode: Ri-an magically realized( just because jae-i asked)that he should apologize for bullying In-ha. There wasn't even a transition before this realization.Like everyone said the revenge plot was totally lost, at some point it was just Kang-ha running behind a girl that never really showed love to him.I really like the idea of everyone finishing happy, but the directors should have developed about how bullies got to realize that what they have done was bad. Everything was rushed at the end( last episode), but they still managed to make it long and boring.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"
tt27763561,"'' Hierarchy '' is a school melodrama that is more about the cinematography than the story. In other words, is more about looks than substance.The story is pretty basic, makjang style, with some rich kids terrorizing the poor students while dealing with their own personal drama. Still, there were some interesting elements at the start of the drama, with some intriguing plotlines.However, as the series progressed, the story got more and more loose, getting boring to boot.As for the romance, or love triangle, it was boring and the leads didn't really have any chemistry.Also, they tried hard to make the rich kids look extra, but they just ended up not looking like teenagers, but rich makjang housewives.At least the performances were enjoyable.So, overall, three out of ten.",negative,"Drama, Romance, Thriller"

How could Jae-I become so cold in a short of time? How could her best friend since childhood become so rude, betray her, become an enemy, and then become fren again with her? That Woojin guy, why can't he tell He-ra that he likes her so that He-ra would give up on Ri-an? What happened with Jae-I's mom that made her father so angry?So many questions cos not logical.

It was hard to connect with their motivations or struggles. I honestly didn't feel a thing about their suffering.The romantic subplot felt forced and underdeveloped. The chemistry between the leads just wasn't there.The revenge plot followed a familiar pattern with no real twists or surprises.

tt27763561,"Six only because of the ost's (that were way too repeated for such a short series) and the picture on my screen. People who have worked on sets, costumes, makeup, coloring, hair --- they know what they're doing.The writers, on the other hand, do not. We have five characters who are on the front, and yet, if you ask me who was the one I remember the most, I wouldn't be able to answer. Because it feels as if those with the script didn't have an idea of what they wanted characters to do, or maybe they just couldn't have the ""main"" love interest for the female lead to be bad.Which brings me to the point of characters. The female lead is... something. They did show the emotional abuse in the family pretty decently considering how small the number of episodes is, but maybe it's the reason why she fells so weak. Abused character who rebels against their own abusive parents and siblings? I'm seated, go on! Character who gets to discover themselves outside of their trauma and learn how to love the world? Great, give me move!.. But not her. She starts the show by walking from the replica of her father just younger, takes a few steps, falls in love with the male lead, doesn't want to come back to the already mentioned replica... and in the end comes back to the already mentioned replica just to make the full circle. The girl is... something. Genuinely. She doesn't grow, she decides that someone who is the leader of a bully gang in the school deserves protection and is worth fighting for. Her friendship with Hera is also something. Everything about her is something.The male lead is... fine, I guess? He's righteous, witty, smart... or so it seemed in the first episodes. Because the actual revenge plan he came up with looks ridiculous, to say the least, and that it works as well is even more hilarious. The fact that he came up with in the last two or three episodes is also interesting, as if the writers remembered they had to have a storyline that included revenge in it.Rian, the main bully and the ""main"" love interest... Oh dear. I don't mind having characters be redeemable. Nor do I mind characters who are obvious villains and have sad/tragic storyline. I'm all in because a good backstory makes the character more believable. It makes them them, it show us why they're the way they're now... but did I hate him lol. We had a great course with him in the first episodes, he's ruthless, he doesn't have any limits, he's powerful and he knows it, he uses it to his advantage. And this guy who beats people left and right, who threatens his own ex-girlfriend to use whatever it will take for him to get to know the truth she doesn't trust him with, becomes a crybaby? All of a sudden, he has a cold mother who doesn't pay him any attention and he's sad about it. And all of a sudden, he becomes a good guy who doesn't bully anymore, he just cries on female lead's shoulder constantly. And all of a sudden, we should sympathise with him because he wanted to be a father. What type of parent someone like him would become at the age of sixteen or whatever? No thought.Hera is the only one I genuinely enjoyed watching. Not because of the character, no. Because of the actress who was good in the role; her character could be a lot. There were so many possibilities with her, and yet writers decided to give her one arc to make her a better person... just for her to come back where she was in episode one.The fifth guy who sleeps with his teacher? I can not remember him. Did he have a story in the stories? I don't know. I never skipped his scenes and yet I can only remember that he's in love with Hera. That's all.Overall, the show feels like a Gossip Girl wannabe. Not the original one --- the reboot one that got cancelled a year or two ago.

While Some Korean dramas have become somewhat predictable, often ending in forced emotional climaxes that evoke tears, I still found this show quite entertaining. It offers numerous lessons, delving into human psychology and nature, as well as philosophical ideas like democracy, communism, socialism, dictatorship, and utilitarianism. The watchers monitoring through CCTV cameras in the drama could represent the elite globalists at the top of the capitalist pyramid, or they could symbolize us. After all, most of us likely enjoyed the show as mere spectators rather than feeling disturbed by it. Still, I always like and want to support this style of drama. That's why I believe it deserves at least an 8 out of 10. This drama had too many of his monologues and it was a bit annoying, so I deducted 1 star.P. S. While watching Squid Game, I couldn't help but notice the irony that the creators and investors of ""The 8 Show,"" including Netflix, are likely not members of the ordinary working class.

I like the part that the more ""sick"" the character is , the higher level they live in.Level 5 looks super kind to others but she have no logical thinking which make thing even worse than being bad.Level 3&4 is in the middle, these are the majority of the people, ordinary .Level 7 are super smart, smart enough to work for the ""level8"" people, even they might be kind, they have to protect themselves before saving others.Level 2 are those people who have high sense of justice. But they are too dumb to protect themselves. That's why bad thing always happens to good people.The 3 points I Deducted from the setting of the show.

Each episode is filled with very interesting and brilliant ideas. The structure of the show is very thought-out. The acting is amazing. The cinematography and music are also perfect. However, the best part of the show is in the message. Behind its ruthless depiction of the

Entire series does have only 8 characters. Definitely does offer lots of intense emotions, thrill, excitement, frustration n keeps you completely hooked up. Though starts on lines of innocence, it ends up getting very violent. If you are only into very sober series, avoid it but if you know what exactly a dark series n like them, then definitely must watch on those terms.

The violence sometimes devolves briefly into overt gore, though is offset with the dark and slapstick humor which gives this series a life of its own.The acting and English voices were both very good. Obviously the budget wasn't huge, with nearly all of the season taking place in a single building, and with a cast of 8 characters. But the set and the filming were both excellent, and the script was pretty brilliant, including in briskly moving along the plot.The plot twists kept coming, and were pretty inventive even when the general progression of events could be guessed at.

The setting and metaphors, as well as the commentary on how society works, are perfect. The out-of-touch ""elite"" girl is annoyingly insufferable.One thing, though, is that I feel like things got a bit too extreme toward the last two episodes. I'm not saying it's impossible for humans to be cruel in the pursuit of money-people have literally killed for money in real life. But for the last two episodes, even though such extreme actions are possible, when it went there so abruptly in the show, it just broke the immersion and suspension of disbelief and make the show felt unsettlingly too weird to watch.Still, this is a highly recommended show to watch.

I can see the similarities with the movie ""The Platform"" and series ""The Squidgame"", but there are still some original thoughts behind it too.The references about the society and the capitalism made depth to the series' plot, but characters poor choices, unnecessary violent scenes and torture part made me fast forward a few parts from the series. Especially the torture scene made me feel sick and in my opinion, it kept going too long too keep me interested in the series. It made me forget all the depth and the potential in the show and I fast forwarded to the end just to see how it ends.I think that the potential was wasted many times during the show. The characters and the acting was good, but in some point it was the same things all over again - upper floors against the lower floors. The graphic scenes seemed to be there just to shock you - there was no deeper meaning or story behind it.From the episode 3 or 4, the writer seemed to take all the easy roads to keep the story going. If only the writer was able to keep the original thought alive and the deep references about the society through the whole show, we would have a masterpiece in our hands.If there would be season 2 (which the ending scene might be promising), I'm not sure if I would watch it. The ending was not as deep as the great beginning would have deserved, so I'm not sure if the series has anything else to offer for season 2 since the original idea was already lost during the episodes 3, 4 and 5.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

The plot director delivers from several point of views of the cast but strongly wanted to show up the poor ones part. There is a classification of privileged and unprivileged where the privileged labours the others and when revolution happens the the table turns. Since there are no other characters available on the plot, the story and scenes stick on within the same faces and tend to bore in middle.If you watch the play from the unprivileged side, director wins and if you watch neutral, you are working the master and to share my experience - I went cruel and slightly supported the privileged side...",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

tt30423279,"""The 8 Show"" on Netflix starts off with great promise but ultimately disappoints. The first episode reels you into the realities of life with a compelling narrative that hooks you instantly. It sets a high bar, making you eager for more. The second episode builds on this by exploring a fantasy of immense wealth, sparking dreams of how such riches could solve one's problems. The third episode introduces the intricacies and wit of the characters, adding depth and complexity that keeps you engaged.However, by the fourth episode, the show begins to falter. The characters start making irrational decisions that undermine the story's credibility. This shift is jarring, considering the initial promise of a smart, well-crafted narrative. Despite my growing frustration, I gave the fifth episode a chance, hoping it would redeem the show. Unfortunately, it didn't. The plot continued to unravel, and the characters' actions remained inconsistent and poorly justified.I had high hopes for ""The 8 Show"" because the beginning hinted at a series with substantial wit and logical sense. The early episodes suggested a thought-provoking storyline with clever characters, but these elements quickly dissolved as the show progressed. The initial intrigue and promise faded, leaving behind a series that struggled to maintain its early momentum and coherence.Ultimately, I decided it was not worth continuing. The potential for a great show was there, but it was squandered by a lack of consistent character development and logical storytelling. I wish the series had stayed true to the sharp wit and logical foundation it initially presented.

Poor writing at this part, I guess.From the 3rd episode onwards all focus was on the time they could be there.

Actually, there were a lot of shocking scenes, but those were the result of human cruelty rather than scenes specifically designed to result in a bloodbath.That said, the drama has some merits, yes, but fails to have a smooth development, even giving a proper conclusion and explanation to the whole ordeal.

But some things were a bit stupid but if people realized why because the people in there went crazy at one point you cant think straight to much going on in your head and take revenge or beating someone up is not the smartest way of solving things, they were multiple people all diffrent thinking and the ideas they had were mostly diffrent but some were close so they took the closest things people thought and went with it that was at the start but if you stay there more the more your thoughts go crazy yk this made them think different more hostile because at the start they were all citizens and tried to solve things a civilized way the only way they knew but later on when the mind is going a diffrent way you will think more about the whole people and not only if you fit in the standard the whole show was not only to show the different classes and that if you are a low class worker there is no chance for going up but also to show how the human mind works and how the different thinking people and people with different mental states are no one is like the other and never will be everyone had their episode because to show this, the people saying that the unlogical things they did was ""stupid"" are the ones that mostly write raigbait or think they are the smartest in the room. This was an incredible show i loved everything the drama humor and the twists props to whoever came up with this.

tt30423279,"I really wasn't sure what to rate this. Honestly, truly, I could pick any number on the ratings spectrum and make an argument for it.Don't know if there's enough shows in the 'trapped and desperate people doing things for money' genre for The 8 Game to rehash tropes, but it somehow does. That being said, it IS inventive in different ways, and keeps the viewer engaged.I could predict about 60% of the plot, which is much less than most, so kudos for that. Korean films and shows can really throw some curve balls with their depravity and plot twists. Might be a slightly different mentality from western culture, I'm not sure what it is, but it works. Train to Busan, I Saw the Devil, Oldboy, there's several gems in Korean cinematography. While I wouldn't place ""The 8 Show"" on the same shelf as these, it's a worthwhile endeavor that's very slippery to define.End of the day, am I glad I watched it? Yeah.

The viewers should get the idea of every eight person's behavior.The fantasy cartoon parts created to make the show cute, didn't suit it well, personally prefered to make the show as much realistic as possible.In conclusion,A good rollercoaster of excitement, no clue of what comes next.Spoiler: Real life can be much more cruel.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"I am gonna be honest I didn't liked the show infact I hated it ! This show seriously tests your patience and specially after Episode 4. First and foremost it had irritating characters (maybe except Floor 2 girl because she atleast was a character who had a spine) and specially Floor 8 was the worst like that evil character needed to die in this show that too in a painful manner but instead the makers made sure that Floor 8 does not even get a scratch ! This show fails at giving you a satisfying revenge on the bad guys because the writers made the good guys dumb! The creators wanted to make ""an intellectual show"" but what they produced was ""an idiotic show""! The good guys were seriously getting tortured throughout the show but once they get free and capture the bad guys they don't try to extract revenge on them like it's so absurd!! Like seriously these guys tortured the hell out of you and you guys are letting them go so easily only for the bad guys to once again recapture the good guys and torture them more!! This show is absurd!! The makers seems to be quiet sadistic regarding the treatment of the good guys , this show's name should have been ""The Torture Show"" as it had torture scenes just for the sake of it which didn't had much purpose in the show. The show had logical loopholes as well like when the good guys decided to end the show by running out of time then why didn't they do it by buying some expensive stuff through time counter in the hall and it could have finished it on the spot! Plus the good guys were 3 males and 2 females but they couldn't overpower the bad guys which had 1 male and 2 females like are you kidding me!!! And while the bad guys had one baseball bat and a tazer but still they could have been defeated as the tazer take time to reload and the guy could have been ambushed by atleast 3 guys!!! The characters are such morons that when Floor 4 was being a slave for Floor 8 , she herself could have overpowered Floor 8 who is not some kind of a fighter but she later on gets the idea to knock her out by using her golf staff like why didn't she used it before?? The makers need to understand that nhilism does not mean reality , they are trying to be too negative about the world. Everything was just unsatisfying about this show specially the ending where they are hosting Floor 1 guy's funeral and they tried to invite the bad guys as well who tortured them like are you guys out of your mind!! These guys should be going after them with a chainsaw and make them pay but no our good guys are so good that they wanna ""make up"" with them!!!

Which nowadays is rare, as the industry is only using the same repetitive formula to try to squish all the series the major quantity of seasons as possible.I came thinking that would be a goofy show or reality and ended with one of the great surprises of the year.You will hate some of the decisions and think at some points why they are doing this? It is always important to understand that the 8 people selected are not your regular people on society, they are people crushed with their life at the edge before being selected to the show... that explains a lot about why they take some outrageous decisions, they were broken before getting in the show, what you would expect after some days within the show?",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,Well I watched the first episode. Thus far it seems like an odd show. I have to say in Asian cultures people are way to polite. That greedy idiot girl if rules didn't exist as this show seems like they don't. Well she would have been beaten. She seems like she will cause a ton of issues and that's what the show people want. What I do t understand is why not beat her and take her room key. What is stopping them from taking a key? I didn't see a single rule that said you are forced to stay in the room you selected. This again is why I think certain cultures think outside the box while others stay in it. Sorry but I would have taken her key and tied her up and tossed her in room 1. Made the guy in room one go to 2. Only because he cant walk. Although I would give him 8 if he was able to make it. But yeah that one girl needs to be dealt with. Our society lets to many idiots run around and say whatever they want on social media like MTG the troll. As humans we should value education and people who are smart. But instead we seem to value idiots on Tiktok or whatever. This show seems fun and I hope the next episodes are good. Hopefully they do something about the idiot spoiled brat. I know I personally would tie her up and make it so she doesn't cause any issues. Because we all know she is going to be a pain in everyone's butt. I would definitely buy a crowbar for protection. The rule said until someone died not if someone has a broken arm or leg.Okay below this is give aways. So episode 5 and 6 are nuts. First off in this situation I would have already had weapons. However the broken phone can become a shiv. The phone cord a weapon as well. The pee and poo weapons. Pens and pencils are weapons. Seriously what is with these people. Also the horrible girl and guy break their knee caps. Simple. Or at the very least buy 3 handcuffs per person. Why? One for the feet and one for the hands and one to put both feet and hands together. Hog tie them. They do not deserve to be shown kindness. That one older lady is going to mess everything up with her insanity and seeing people that aren't their. She is going to get someone killed I know it. Because she will let someone free and that person will hurt a ton of people. The guy floor 6 and girl floor 8 are psychopaths. Seriously how has no one thought of first buying food with floor 8s money. Also taking their cards and switching rooms. The rules never said you had to stay in the room you selected. So toss floor 8 and 6 into 1 and 2 and give 1 floor 8 and 2 floor 6. That would be the best thing for the show. But it's a Korean show so I am guessing floor 6 will get free and end someone and really hurt others. Because Korean shows don't show fantasies. They show reality. Like how most people sheep and submissive. They will do anything and be okay with it.This show is really good. It pisses me off and makes me mad. Because I feel for the lower floors. I was t them to take out those who hurt them. But they are such subs and wimps. But then again it's probably why they are in this situation. But seriously they need to grow a pair. At the very least put all the poop and pee in their rooms. And use their money to buy food and clean clothes and whatnot. I mean seriously they asked floor 8 if it is okay to spend some money on an item. Really? You ask the person who started the torture. If this isn't a show about Asian society. I don't know what is.,neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"This definitely kept my interest but it was very frustrating to watch at times. Got to a point where the only reason I was watching was to see the bottom people get back at the top. There are some major plot holes like why when the bottom people took over did they not just run out the time on the clock with purchases. Or why did they not buy weapons to protect themselves like the others had. They could have bought weapons to protect themselves and run out the time lol. There were several times I wanted to just stop watching the show but didn't in hopes of a satisfactory ending. That didn't happen. Lots of violence for people who enjoy violent nonsense. Great if you're a sadist but there were parts I had to fast forwarded through. How did number 6 get his bat back? They really didn't take that, and the taser? Number 8 was frustratingly awful. I'm sure making the person in the most powerful position a total psychopath felt like entertainment value but again, makes it a harder watch at times. 2 was the only character worth liking. When I first started this I was telling my boyfriend he needed to check it out, not sure it's worth recommending anymore. Just so annoyed by the clear plot hole of the time not being run out when were trying to wait time out. So ridiculous. Totally cynical. Glad it's over. I would not compare it to Squid Games or the Platform.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"I want to support the progress of Asian content as much as possible, but I cannot recommend this show for the sheer frustration is causes.This promises a gripping tale of survival in a high-rise building, but it quickly devolves into a frustrating experience filled with numerous plot holes and implausible scenarios. Despite its initial intriguing setup, the series leaves much to be desired in terms of coherence and logical storytelling.From the outset, one of the most glaring issues is the logistical implausibility surrounding the 8th floor. The premise suggests that all furniture and fixtures must be transported through a single chute. However, the apartments are inexplicably furnished with large, cumbersome items such as sofas, wardrobes, and kitchen appliances. How these items were maneuvered through the chute and/or installed is never explained, leaving a significant hole in the narrative.Another perplexing aspect of the show is the characters' baffling inaction regarding the main lobby phone. There were many things that reasonable people would have used the phone for that I can't exhaustively get into, but at a certain point, they wanted to run down the clock, like ASAP. They could have bought stuff to run it down, but chose to just let it run down overnight. Why? This passive approach feels both unrealistic and frustrating, undermining the tension and urgency that should drive a survival narrative. Viewers are left wondering why the characters, portrayed as reasonably intelligent, did not take more proactive approach.The show also suffers from several implausible and poorly executed plot points. One particularly egregious example is the scene where a character wakes up to discover her teeth have been removed without her noticing. The process of extracting teeth is inherently painful and bloody, making it impossible for such an act to occur without waking the victim. Similarly, another character has his toenails removed without screaming, an equally improbable scenario given the excruciating pain involved. These scenes stretch believability to its breaking point, further eroding the show's credibility.Compounding these issues is the question of how the perpetrator managed to reach both victims without being noticed. The show establishes that the elevator is noisy and noticeable, and the characters would have spotted anyone using the stairs. Yet, the perpetrator somehow manages to move undetected. This inconsistency is never addressed, adding another layer of frustration for viewers trying to make sense of the plot.Beyond these logistical and narrative flaws, the creator seems overly focused on infuriating viewers with the depiction of social injustice and the arbitrary nature of privilege. While exploring themes of class and privilege is common in Korean dramas, this show leans excessively into suffering and anguish without offering proper resolution or retribution. The result is a story that feels more like a series of injustices designed to frustrate rather than engage the audience.Moreover, the show employs a tired trope where the protagonist, on the brink of achieving their revenge, is rendered impotent by a sudden moral epiphany or a desire to retain their humanity-qualities that their abusers have already stripped from them. This trope not only feels cliched but also robs the story of a satisfying resolution. Instead of seeing the protagonist rise above their tormentors, viewers are left with a sense of unfinished business and unfulfilled justice.In conclusion, this show falls far short of its potential. The numerous plot holes, logistical implausibilities, and frustrating narrative choices make it a difficult watch. While it aims to comment on social issues, its execution is flawed, leaving viewers more exasperated than enlightened. Unless you enjoy being frustrated by illogical storytelling and unresolved suffering, this series is not worth the anguish.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"It's like ""The Platform"" and ""Squid Game"" had a baby-a baby that had every chance to become great, but then started doing hard drugs, became mentally challenged, and jumped off a bridge. Sadly, the bridge wasn't high enough, so now it's just a mutant with no functional cells trying to swim to shore but can't, slowly drowning in the shallow river it jumped into.Seriously though, they could have made it so easy for themselves. Having sex gives 70 hours? And they just do it once? And how about everyone takes care of their own poop? And when they wanted it to end while the bad guys are tied up, why not order a bunch of luxury stuff to lose the remaining time?And don't get me started on the main guy. I've rarely seen a show with such an unlikeable main character. Why am I supposed to root for this dumb, spineless loser?Also, in the end, some dude who can barely walk balances over a rope and starts using it as a trampoline to jump like 20 meters up.

tt30423279,"A dark comedy or satire with the unique themes present in this show needs to have at least semi-relatable characters that have basic common sense. They don't have to be the most rational or logical individuals, but the audience should at least feel some sort of emotional connection with them in order to suspend their disbelief.The 8 Show faces a significant challenge here, and unfortunately I think the approach they went with is far too comical, and falls significantly short of quality dark comedy as a result. The contestants are exaggerated caricatures as opposed to relatable humans, and the plot depends far too much on ridiculous decisions and unbelievable traits to progress through a runtime that is about 2 hours too long.I really wanted to like it as I'm a huge fan of satire, especially of the dark variety.

If you have a problem with the toilet wast in the rooms, why don't you order a toilet that everybody can us in the common room and store the wast there? It's clear that using violence is not a problem for some of the characters, so why is nobody just taking the room key from the psychopath woman on floor 8 and do as they please with the room and the food that gets delivered to this room first? This kind of questions I had like every 5 minutes while watching.

some of them so badly wanted to end the show. When it is up to 9 hours left, then something happen and added up the time, they could have just buy stuffs from the main hall to end the time. But what they did? They add unnecessary drama to prolong it.

This show started off intriguing...and once I grasped the gist, which didn't take long, I was interested to see how these characters would choose to extend their time in the game and increase their winnings. I knew violence would begin, but after it started the show quickly spiraled downward into stupidity.First of all the characters really had no depth, and the decisions they made were just absolutely ridiculous. I get the metophorical symbolism with the hierarchy of the floors, but they should've made better decisions with the script.There were a ton of plot holes too.The greatest of all my frustrations with the show was why these characters (with the exception of two) decided to remain in their sweaty dirty piss and blood stained outfits for the entire time (which was months). While the cost of a new outfit was probably a lot, they all could've easily done this. Especially when they began pissing themselves from being tased, they remained in the outfits!The dumb decisions made were just astronomical but that one above all just baffled me.Also one cinematic plot hole that made no sense...none of the men grew any facial hair the entire time.

Right off the start it was clear that the top floors are going to bully the bottom ones, and it just happened to be that the most psychotic ones were at the top and got all the power. It was still, pretty interesting to watch the bottom floors fighting for some kind of ""justice"", but then, the creators had a chance to make something good, and they missed it. They were mistaken into thinking that the violence and the injustice should get more and more extreme to keep things interesting.. so they simply decided to ruin things and make the top floor a ""smiling dictator"". She would devour anything and anyone in her path for her own joy and they had a chance to at least give us some sort of satisfaction.. by finally tasing her.. but nope.

tt30423279,"I went into this with an open mind, given its interesting premise, however wish I'd have spent my time doing something else.The character are very one dimensional, one aspect that was really missing was further development, what their motivations are and how they ended up the way they are. You see small snippets of their background but never enough to actually get to know the character, you can describe every character using two personality traits, there's no further depth to them.This would have worked a lot better as a long movie, or 4 episodes max. The first few episodes are okay but these even suffer from drawn out scenes which feel like filler, the last two episodes were mostly filler, with one episode featuring flashing lights for the majority of the episode - perhaps an artistic choice to make the viewer suffer in line with the characters, but for me this episode was just unwatchable and I fast forwarded through it.Back to my issue with the length - 8 episodes were likely just picked to match the name of the show but it feels as though they absolutely didn't have enough content.There are weird special effects thrown in which feel really out of place, are quite poor and feel like they go on forever, again, in an attempt to fill 8 episodes. It appears as 'trying too hard' to be artsy.Lots of over the top violence, which realistically should have led to multiple deaths early on, but all characters appear to be made of rubber, and other than sfx make up seem to make a full recovery just a few scenes later. Genuinely, almost all characters should have died or suffered extensive brain damage with the amount of blows that are dealt in this show. I'm not usually fussy about realism, but it gets a bit ridiculous when it's the same thing over and over.It would have been nice to see an approach where manipulation and mind games could ply a larger part in defining hierarchy, however, there is only one character that truly engages in this.One of my pet peeves is when a character makes a ridiculously stupid decision (without a background or personal motive), which this of course features.In terms of the positives it has an interesting premise, is quite good at making you side with the protagonist, and does somehow compel you to watch to the end in case something interesting may actually happen.

However, the script got worse and worse with many plot holes. The production also looked much lower budget than Squid Game, because the story just cycled between being in one room and outside that same room. There were no other settings besides brief flashbacks to the past. The games were very basic, played among themselves without any investment in creating new sets or scenes.

for the sake of money, but not in a boring way. It doesn't hold attention, and I rewound most of the series to get to the end faster. I cannot comment on the acting because the series is not in my native language, but I can comment on the series itself.

tt30423279,"I never write reviews and i don't watch netflix shows or any shows too often because for me it honestly seems like a waste of time. I got on netflix because i was lost this morning with what i wanted to do today (I had too much free time) And decided to make this stupid decision to watch this show because it seemed cool. First off when 3rd floor wanted to jump off the bridge i already can't remember why - he was depressed because of debt and he had these 2 bullies chasing him at the start- who tf are they, is one of these bullies later in the program, or something? Or they're just not really relevant? Nvm about that, after being in that long car after bring sent the money i realized this is a show like squid game. He entered the hall, chose a card... honestly it was kind of cool. Fast forward to episode 5 alot of things didn't make any sense lmao. In the rule book it was mentioned that it is not allowed for the characters to hang out outside after midnight but it literally seemed like that 20 precent of the time when floor 3 and floor 7 were smoking it seemed like it passed midnight and literally all the other times when other characters hanged out outside, seemed like they broke that rule but idk. It just made me confused.The main character is so forgetable, i literally forgot he existed into episode 6, i think they needed to provide more of what he thought and his prespective to everything thats going on from his prespective, into the later episodes we just viewed the show from a general prespective and not 3rd floor's prespective which literall just kinda made me forget about the main character.I hate the idea that floor 3 has to be so weak and ""UHUUHUH IM SCARED UHUHH"" please stop😭.it's literally annoying that they have to make him so weak, it's not cool netflix, you can make him change his personality, let him beat 8 floor after she literally abused them for so long, literally let the character change. Also so much violence for literally no reason. I don't know how much can 2nd floor get beat up- how doesnt she get brain damage, the hell? She got beat up by 6th floor like 10 times throughout this whole show. The torture of the characters in the later episodes were hard to watch. I love violence in these kind of shows but in this it was just unnecessary.. I just kept watching through that because i thought something would get better but it didn't. I'm sorry that i'm writing this review in a bad way but i'm just fed up, there's so many concepts in this show so many stuff... But i think the main annoying thing about the show is that nothing is really rewarding, i'm sure most of the viewers wanted to see 8floor getting beatup but at the end we just see her getting jailed? Like we didnt even see her getting jailed they just said she's in prision? Also the filming when 2nd floor and one of the other girls kissed each other that was unnecessary it seemed like high schoolers recorded that scene of craziness.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"Honestly the review title says it all.Korea Netflix has decided now is the time to give a less violent version of Kaiji and Squid Games (which is a knock off of Kaiji). The premise is that a corporation lures poor people to undertake inhumane games for the sake of entertainment. Fake environment with stairs. Yawn. That's already been done.The characters are not real people but caricatures of ""rough buff guy"", ""nerdy smart guy"", ""dumb but likable protagonist"", ""motherly middle aged woman"", ""edgy woman with a chip on her shoulder"", ""kiss the feet of whoever in on top girl"", ""person with a disability whose entire personality is based on their disability (seems ableist actually) rather showcasing them as a complex human"", and ""quirky cute girl who turns out to be mean"". These paper characters are unfortunately common tropes you see in K-dramas, but you get the idea.Instead of interesting human-led drama you just get these cardboard facades playing into their personalities to give you plot twists that can be predicted from episode 1, and an ending that not only dis-serves the disabled character and refuses him to contribute to the story in a meaningful way other than using his disability and ending as a way to gain emotional sympathy. In a way it's infantilizing.This was marked as a dark comedy by Netflix and I don't think my mouth moved except when yawning or coughing. Yes, seriously.Instead of investing in good shows, Netflix continues to put out 90% barely watchable content in hopes it tides you over until they release the shows they actually invest their money and good writers in.This show is not worth your time.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"As other reviewers have said, this series feels very inspired by both Squid Games and The Platform. There's absolutely no way to watch this and not be reminded of those, if you have seen the other two before watching. It's not just a mash up of the two though - it has its own unique premise and plot, so definitely not a rip off but definitely still inspired by.Anyways, to talk about THIS show - it was decent. I didn't finish it feeling like I wasted my time. It kept me intrigued enough to binge the 8 episodes. But I also have no hunger for a season two (which is slightly odd for me for a show that kept me intrigued enough to binge). It didn't provide any moment where I ever went ""OH WOOOOOW I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT"", it didn't change my perspective on anything, it didn't leave me with any sort of... answers OR questions. My favourite shows are the ones that DO those things - the shows where I FEEL different after watching or I THINK about things differently after watching. Those are the shows I think about years later and keep rewatching (Squid Games and The Platform both achieved that for me). This was an entertaining, quality show, but it does not join THAT list. It was a good way to spend a rainy day with a coffee and a blanket, but overall I will have forgotten it in a few months.But, if you like these kinds of shows/movies it's definitely worth checking out if you've got nothing better on your watchlist!",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"Once you watch squid game, You are never gonna like this show. The storyline, the presentation is so poor, and it is so Stretched, I felt like when this show will be ending. I watched this show at a speed of 1.5.They were just continuously showing how the upper floors are cruel and lower floors are struggling or in pain. So basically they wanted to show the capitalism in society and how the people who has money or power, dominate the people who are poor or does not have powers. But I personally did not like the show. I Was not at all hooked with the show.Further, people who had either no money or has lost fame or is losing in the business, they were selected for the show. The storyline is only that there are people who wanted to see some entertaining show, so these people who are players are given time based on the Fact that they can entertain the people watching the show. But there was no connection who are watching the shows and a basis behind it. They could have connected the dots in a better way.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"
tt30423279,"The idea fits well within the genre - the concept is very good - and the societal critique well intended. They covered a lot of topics about how our society works and all the misery led by it. Generally; the messages conveyed by this piece are great.Unfortunately, the series declined in quality and suspense with every episode and the characters stayed rather shallow.Random things that seem to not exist in this universe:
-> Infections
-> Force trauma, hematoma
-> Poisoning (from the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide coming from the feces for example)
-> Internal bleeding, brain injury
-> thrombosis
-> exposure keratopathy (eyes drying out from the torture device)
etc.While it is obvious that the writers want to reflect real world problems with this series, they should have done more to preserve some sense of logic and incorporate ways to tackle the logic holes while still maintaining the rules of the show.The characters are incredibly stupid at times and also rather predictable - it would be fine if they were consistently like this. But the writing made them switch between semi clever and intellectually impaired all the time.This makes the whole series just frustrating to watch. Because you'll already know what's gonna happen.Anyway - some thoughts about the floors:1 - Caricature of the non-abled people in our society. One of the better characters were it not for his cliché backstory (sick child, needs money).2 - Is she supposed to depict the negative sides of communism?3 - Rarely witnessed an MC with this little depth. His introduction in ep1 was interesting (though never catched back upon again) - but every time he opens his mouth it's just dry air (except for ep8).4 - Is she supposed to depict a child? Otherwise I can't explain myself the actress' acting. But then again it doesn't match with what the character is doing. All in all just unbelievable portrayal of a person - no person is actually like this. And I'm aware of the cultural differences between SK and me (central europe), but I've been watching south east asian TV for over a decade now and still.5 - Don't get me started, this review would never end. Fun fact; her backstory doesn't even work; you can't just sell real estate property that belongs to your husband without his involvement.6 - Unhinged violence; I guess every series needs a cliché gangster.7 - Best character together with 1 and 2; but still would have wished for a little more depth. His very short backstory was intriguing though!8 - Unrealistically annoying. She doesn't posess fear or any form of common sense it seems. A person like this wouldn't even have survived before the start of the series. She does nothing to secure her position at floor 8 and just got by with luck (if any of the other characters were a bit smarter, she'd have lost her place in the first episode already). But I guess this is the way she was intended. She is probably written like this to mirror the societal structure that protects her and they want to show that she doesn't care about the usual status symbols. And in that sense I guess it can work?Good stuff:
-> the 1 billion floor switch was a good twist
-> the set (while getting boring after several episodes) had a nice design
-> combining the premise of 'the floor' with other survival game genre tropes worked well
-> the cinematography was pleasantly good (the style, colors, atmosphere, camera work etc.)
-> the ending (floor 1's performance and the symbolism) was very goodEnding episodes nonsense:
In ep7; why would floor 4 and 5 agree to setup a sleep deprivation torture? Their characters before were naive but not violent. They wanted the show to end as well - it makes absolutely 0 sense that this was happening. And this is ignoring that the whole torture scene wouldn't work by 'maintaining bodily functions' - humans die after several days of no sleep and their vision would be impaired without proper hydration of the eyes.Also, why would 4 and 5 need to untie the others to overthrow 8? Just take her gun away when she's not looking and you can forget that whole plot.Also if they want the time to run out, they could just buy stuff at the market place. Anyway.I could talk forever about the things that don't make sense ... especially as the series goes on ... but let's end the review here. The concept is very good, nice symbolism and message, the first episode was catchy, generally an okay to good watch but it really fell off over time.Thanks for reading :)",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

It didn't share any lesson or message.The show was sad and had a lot of pointless harsh scenes.'Squid Game' had a story with a lesson and 'The Platform' had many moral messages. But this one didn't make me feel anything.At the end, I was just like, 'So what? Is that it?' No lessons? No messages? Nothing?I wouldn't suggest watching this. I wanted to like it, but after all the episodes, there was nothing.Anyway, these are just my thoughts. Check it out yourself, but you can't ignore that it's not great.

tt30423279,"The 8 Show started with an intriguing plot: Eight characters are invited to a game show. Each are given a floor in an artificial building to live in; the higher your floor, the more money and privilege you'll have. Now they have to survive while trying to entertain the show's viewers to keep the game going for as long as possible.The good: The characters start out likable with some fun personality; there's a bit of intrigue about their backgrounds, as each character was hand-selected and each episode starts with a character intro. There are moments of genuine humor. The first three episodes are captivating as we figure out the rules. The child-like and artificial set design is memorable.Unfortunately, the quality dips significantly after episode three. Despite early intriques, characters turn out very cliche. The game runs out of rules so the Show becomes about interpersonal drama; however, the characters are so illogical and unmotivated that their actions will frustrate you to the point of tearing your hair out.There's an obvious evocation of class hierarchy, but it's shallow. The show only wants to replicate the hierarchy and the violence within it. As a result, you're just watching unlikble people wallow in drama and misery, playing against their mutual interests, literally torturing each other, and trying to outdo each other's violence. All of this accumulates in an incredibly unsatisfying ending where one character just tells another what happened to the ""bad guy"". Literally- they met up, one character shows another a news article on their phone and described how the antagonist was in jail-- no flashback or anything. The show doesn't give us too many new or interesting to chew on- no catharsis, no revelation, no emotional reflections.Compare The 8 Show to Squid Game or Parasite, both of which evoke class struggle; unlike The 8 Show, they provide us with many points of reflections. Characters are so humanized that we root for them. They are given sensible motives that guide their decisions. The pain we see done unto them, a reflection of class violence, are gut punches. Both of these shows also contain much deeper dialogue and imagery that reveal the mechanisms of class hierarchy and capitalism.The 8 Show is also a critique of reality TVs as well as influencer culture-- demonstrating the dehumanization of struggling people having to fight over money for public consumption. The most interesting part of this metaphor can be found in the main villain, who sits at the top floor; she is an artist who sees the show as her stage to craft a masterpiece. I feel she represents the way artists also try to replicate and capitalize on representation of trauma for clout. Though, in away, this is a perfect critique of the Show, isn't it?",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery"

Mindless violence for NO REASON, which makes it so boring. The one 'good' twist is predictable as anything too.Snoozefest. The 3 stars was for the actors who I did enjoy.

tt30423279,"I wish I could give a positive review, and I almost did.But the middle was so bad, I just can't. Had to switch to watching on my laptop at some point just so I could watch at 1.5x speed.Good:
What is it with those Korean critiques of modern capitalism? The show has this Orwell novel feeling, however it doesn't deliver 100% on that. Not necessarily a bad thing - I would likely have been bored if it was just another retelling of Orwells work in disguise -, but at one point I was hoping for a 1984 plot point the show sadly didn't explore. I loved how different ideas of social structures were explored, but on the other hand it didn't feel like the ideas or problems themselves are anything new - just the presentation, but still fun.Bad:
There were points, especially around ep 4, that were hard to endure. In my mind moral injustice has to feel believable to have the right effect in a story, but at this point the story is at a logic low point.Overall: Actions are forgiven, injuries are only visual, and while the show claims characters minds are suffering, it can't be observed in their actions.Parts of the show felt like watching engagement farming ""rage-bait"" content on social media.The violence and suffering lacks a hierarchy, it's difficult to tell how impactful something is until the show comes around and plainly tells you, and characters go to horrible experiences so easily that it quickly becomes ineffective to spark interest in the viewer.I must point out, this dosen't apply to the whole show. Some plot points are great and intelligently deliver on the promise of social commentary. But most of it is not.Verdict:
So close to being a great, intelligent show. Maybe it's just too much to handle? This is a show most people will either hate or love. I wasn't immediately sure what side I am on but I noticed: I didn't gain any new perspective, I didn't think about the social dilemma but the story loop holes, and I almost quit midway and had to watch at 1.5x speed.

So they had the characters make as many dumb decisions as you can imagine. They are soooo many moments when you'll be asking ""Why are they doing this ??

All the criticism, the beautiful metaphors, the violence etc, everything had its place and its time and dosage in ""The Platform"" and ""El Hoyo"". Here in ""the 8 show"" it merely seemed like how absurd and nonsensical the producers were able to design the show.I only watched it until the end because of one reliable user review of this show that was written by 'wavey-lip' (thank you very much !!! @wavey-lip) where he pointed out that in episode 7 the viewer is tested regarding how much nonsense one could take.

At first, I am intrigued, initially comparing to ""The Squid Game"" but this show is supposed to be more than that, a philosophical commentary on our modern existence. It does achieve these philosophies in the first episode or so, making you ponder and decode the metaphors presented. Unfortunately, the execution of all this gets muddled by these rather one-dimensional characters. They are more like caricatures than real people who are going through struggles, pain, and suffering.

They must entertain the viewers, thereby earning more time to make more money. It is a neat concept but feels like an incomplete idea.The characters are not really given much backstory either, which is disappointing. Our protagonist, who is colloquially known to us as Third Floor is the only character whose backstory we kind of know about. He is not very likable, either. It would have been nice if the other characters were given more depth and equal screen time so the audience could choose who to root for.I cannot really recommend this show, however. It is very sadistic, as it aims to explore the limits of human depravity.

tt30423279,"Comparisons will inevitably be made to Squid Game.One of the reasons Squid Game endeared itself to audiences was that the atmosphere of twisted fantasy was enough to make you forget about the heartless violence. You also cared about the characters enough to continue watching. With The 8 Show, the sympathetic characters are at worst, spineless and passive. At best, they are overly contemplative and idealistic.So... did you finish? Did you get to episode 8? Well, now you have a decision. Do you tell your coworkers and/or friends that you didn't like it and risk being called a prudish puritan or do you conclude that this is ...provocative ...bold ...challenging art?If you're like me, you reflected on what you watched and realized that the thematic elements making up The 8 Show are laid on so thick, that even if you can stomach the depravity on display, you realize that you're being treated to what is essentially a grab of obvious source material: Big Brother, Clockwork Orange, Salo: 120 Days of Sodom, The Stanford Experiment.We're supposed to marvel at the sadism, contemplate the morality, be intrigued by the societal metaphors and finally, be terrified at the grotesque surreal spectacle of torture. But that only starts around episode 6. The first five episodes are entertaining and fun. We enjoy the character dynamics, become emotionally invested in the plot. Then things take a turn for the worse, both for the characters and for you as a viewer.

It wasn't a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I'm not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I'm in the 5th episode right now, and so far I've felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there's no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn't use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you'll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it's well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It's worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It's well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"When I heard of this Korean high school zombie series I was interested, despite the subject matter being done to death over the years. Then I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing. Having just finished up the show, I can confirm that this is one of the most entertaining shows out there, and far surpasses the likes of THE WALKING DEAD. The small scale works a treat and somehow they manage to eke out the momentum over the whole 12-episode arc. It never feels too small and it never feels dull, packed as it is with expertly directed action and tense mayhem. The Koreans excel in this one and I loved every minute of it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I'm for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just ""it started"". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just ""what""? So the teacher's son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I'm impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just ""burn them all""? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would've separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it's a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what's going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it's a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can't help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia's gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious ""half zombies"" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully's obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn't die anymore... and she couldn't do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It's like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn't terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren't actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series.

The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.,positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don't act accordingly to defend themselves?I've been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there's a trend where people don't do the right thing so they don't embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre.

tt14169960,"Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it's not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography.

tt14169960,"There is a lot to say about this zombie teenage drama.The zombie portion is done very well, the only reason I bumped it up to 7 stars instead of 6 is how all of the constituent parts come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts, but this series is not without its flaws.If you can appreciate good acting, a nice score, great cinematography, and a decent story (and love zombies) then this is for you.However, if you're a logically minded person then this will be a trial of frustration in which characters will continually make the worst decisions possible.Whatever you imagine you would do in the character's situation you can almost bet that they will go about things in the worst way imaginable. This is a compounding problem. There is no salvation from idiocy here, only bad decision after bad decision. This can be tolerated to an extent but the frustration only continues to rise.Despite this glaring problem, everything else balances it out. It's worth watching if only because the dumb decisions benefit from the suspension of disbelief. You will find yourself rooting for the cast and get caught up in their emotional drama. You will find both high points and low points worth celebrating and mourning, all of the braindead decision-making be damned, you'll still be forced to feel something.It's not the best zombie flick, but it's a damn good addition and a worthy addition to the Z-roster.

However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie.

They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let's stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let's stare.

Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok.

Some characters do things that don't make a lot of sense, like taking unnecessary risks or not helping other characters they like. The show also excessively wastes time on characters who do nothing in the grand scheme of things. One person essentially took like 2 hours of screen time in the first season, opened a door for the main group, and then left. While that gives the feeling that any character could die, it also makes it seem like only the core characters actually matter and that everyone will just vanish or die from the show. Not to mention that there is a character who could easily deal with many of the issues the main group faces and... just doesn't? Maybe they explain at some point why this girl doesn't use her unique abilities more... but it seems like most problems are easily solved by getting that girl to go do things for the group.

I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads.

Dialog is in Korean so let's leave that to the Korean speakers to decide if it's natural or not.Zombie fighting scenes are well-choreographed, entertaining and brutal but not gratuitously gory, the most fun part of the series. Main antagonist was given too little screen time (fighting scenes against villain too short, often ends abruptly).Plot is the weakest point. Plot holes plenty, including questionable character decisions (to put it mildly), unimpactful characters/storylines, plus the multiple story lines didn't really connect to each other or went anywhere, leaving many unresolved questions but probably banking on another season (the culture of always save some mysteries for new seasons instead of having an all-conclusive story).Occasionally force-feeds audience unnecessary expositions.Kudos for featuring real phone and computer UI instead of dummy OS interface to avoid lawsuits like other big titles.Netflix please don't cop out and try to revive fan-favourite characters just for the sake of fan service, be unapologetic and let them die.---All in all: worth a watch---",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

This could be a great show if the writers said what would I do in this situation instead of how can we throw in as many metaphors and quotes that now for some reason we have to analyze. Also, weren't those soldiers trained? How did they miss shooting him so badly that he was only hit randomly underwater? They should've lit him up profusely before he even touched the water.

When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes.

Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I'll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show's mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn't want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won't. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they're about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show's pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don't know Korea's standards but WOW everyone's so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. 💪🏻 Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"I'm not giving this a rating because I've only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they're twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly.

You would expect that, wouldn't you?!One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do.

The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack.

I love it and its good fun watchable television; better than any reality series trash!The only time that the series is/was calm and plodding along was in the first episode - before anyone turned Zombie - but after that it was a case of Shock, jump out of skin and a continuous Holy Crap viewing time :) Its come along just in time seeing that ""The WALKING DEAD"" will be no more each week...it had a good run though and was highly enjoyable viewing.Don't sit next to your girlfriend, sister or wife when watching this; unless you are wearing some kind of, good thick anti nails digging into your arm, protection!

tt14169960,When this first started I was excited and enjoyed it but as the episodes piled up I found the plot stale. This show acknowledges Zombies but yet doesn't follow any protocol of anyone in the show knowing what to do with zombies. Like no one is stabbing these zombies in the head for every attack. Some shots are head shots but they are few and far between. I mean they are stuck in situations and they could easily get out of the characters with stabbing objects just jabbed them in the head. Nope. Instead they just whack them all over and somehow these zombies just fall down. Plus these zombies are very easy to just throw and fight off without weapons. There needs to be more gore also. Like no limbs are being torn off by zombies or guts ripped out or even chunks being ripped out with their teeth. You also have character build up and creating a story and then they just get bit and sacrifice themselves to save the group. This happens like 5-6 times. You have a girls father trying to get to her to save her for 8 episodes just to have him show up and die 4 minutes later. Like why the build up. That was terrible. Built him up like he was gonna come in and save the day and be a badass but nope. Just shows up and opens a door and then walks 30 yards and just throws away all survival instinct he had the entire show and just dies. Towards the end of the series the characters make worse and worse decisions. Oh a herd of zombies are coming? We've been hiding and running the enter show but now let's be out in the street and fight them all. Literally have shovels and they aren't chopping off heads. Nah. Let's hit them in the arms and legs and back. Why not go into one of the 30 houses and hide and survive. Nope. Just a stupid battle to kill off another character. They also need Korean voice actors who were born and raised in the US and speak English bc these translators say stuff that makes no sense.,negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight.

Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren't all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn't eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it. After all, his body was crunched, twisted, bit, smashed, mashed... he looked like hell so why was he worried about his eye for?I think this would've been a lot better if they had only trimmed the melodramatic repetitive fat and kept it to six episodes.Anywho...",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it's a mid tier apocalyptic show.The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one.

whenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there's enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show.

I know this is a fiction however the reason why I don't like the ending is because, in a fiction called Hunger Games: Catching Fire, no one would like to play the games for the 3rd quarter quell because it can mean death, again.Train to Busan and Kingdom is very, very good that's why it somehow shattered my expectations specially from the trailer.I can't also help but to compare it to Highschool of the Dead, it is shorter but a lot of things happened (I can let this go because I have to consider the pandemic which limits resources and locations.)",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn't really much of a narrative there, it's just a lot of ""oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape"" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.If you like the genre then you'll probably enjoy it, if not, don't watch it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"The action and effects in this are pretty good and clearly they put some money into it which you then see start to disappear as the series continues. Maybe if they kept it short at 6 episodes instead of 12 they could of keep the money in the right places like hiring writers. The main premise of the story is so stupid once revealed I only kept watching to see how this not ""Train to Busan"" would crash and burn. It's obvious this was made during the great zombie hype of that better movie. They even reference it in the show multiple times like a dumb nod to the fan base. We get it. They watch a zombie move and yet learned nothing from it about survival.Ok so the dumbest part is that the origin of the virus was created by a high school science teacher in response to his son being bullied. You would think ""oh is it to infect the bullies."" No. He infects his son thinking that it will make him stronger and fight, which he shames his son for not fighting back. The school for some dumb reason just lets the bullies do whatever and it's not like it's established that the bullies have rich parents or parents in a position of power in the school. The school just doesn't want the controversy and tells its own faculty members to just let their kids get abused and keep it silent because it will look bad for the school. How does any of that make any sense? The bullies are putting rape videos up online and the school thinks the problem is the victims complain about it because that makes the school look bad not the rape videos. South Korea must be pretty messed up if that's the logic their schools take.So science daddy instead of doing the more logical and doable things, like sending his son to another school, decides he needs to create a virus to help evolve his son but oh no it just turns his son into a zombie and he attacks the bullies back but doesn't infect them and daddy locks him up in his house where he manages to infect his mother who has no lines other than to be a zombie. So I guess she had no say in the whole turn her son into a zombie because he's a wimp against a gang of bullies.So I'm not a writer but I think almost any other explanation for the virus would have been better than the whole dad is motived by his weak son to create a virus. It gets worse when the dad is caught by the police and tells them all the answers to the virus are on his laptop including alluding to the fact that the solution to a cure is on there. He doesn't give them a password so I guess he just leaves all his mad scientist stuff out there on an unsecured laptop in a high school and yet he works at a school where the computers are password protected. Sure lets just ignore that one. Anyway, they get the laptop and there is nothing but stupid videos of him blabbering about nonsense like a dumb incel complaining about the current state of mankind and thus he needed to create the Chad virus so his son would become an alpha. Ugh. They don't show anything that looks like scientific documents or research. The videos on the laptop only concluded that the only cure is to kill them which he couldn't do to his son and wife. So why did he waste everyone's time saying that the only solution was on his laptop instead of telling them there is no cure!This show has a storyline problem like that, where it builds up something like characters are going to have a redemption story arch only to punk out on it, to be edgy I guess. Mom dramatically runs to the school to save her son, they make seem like she will make it but no she gets bitten only to magically show up in time to trigger her son when he's escaping. Karen spoiled girl intentionally infects a poor student because she hates the poors and then once caught the other students exile her but the dumb teacher decides that the girl is worth saving for no reason and locks her in a room with food and water and dramatically tells her to help the other students later while she is getting eaten by zombies. Spoiled girl could have opened the room at any point when she could hear that the students were in the other room but she kept quite and barred the door. She only had a moment of empathy way late in the game when she decides she's going to go to the roof and help the other students with food and water only to be instantly killed by the half zombie bully in another denial of redemption. I could go on and on there are a million story lines like that.I knew it was going to get extra dumb once they had the bully, the rape victim, and the class president be the ONLY ones to come back from the dead and be half zombies. Of which they keep the bully around until the 2nd last episode to just show up many times for dramatic nonsense and fail and keep trying to kill the one guy who he has a grudge against for bashing out his eye and throwing him to the zombies because he was defending himself, oh and he defended the bullying victims once. I really thought they were going to have an epic battle with the bully vs. Rape victim but instead they made her crazy and destroy all the cellphones to try and stop her rape video from being automatically shared on social media, which wouldn't stop a scheduled post from being posted. She was on the top of the building literally watching 3/4 of her school running around as zombies and she's afraid they will see her rape video and judge her. THEY'RE ZOMBIES! It makes zero sense for her to have any motives like that. The show just needed a way to get ride of the cellphones so the kids couldn't call for help. They immediately destroy one computer after facebooking what's happening for one second and then yay all phones and internet get cut by the military because they have that power and over react to a prank video. There are so many better ways they could have handled the cut off of communication but they choose every dumb way possible to do it. Military has a million drones but only decides to use them to lure zombies to a spot to drop bombs. Nowhere did they even try to use them to find survivors and they tried to make it seem like some military conspiracy to be incompetent and murderous for no reason.Then the last episode ends everything in the dumbest way possible. One of the girls can easily sneak out of this heavily guarded and monitored military quarantine zone they have been in for four months now and goes up to the mountain I guess is a few feet near by and can see a small fire on the school roof from what looks like miles away, as if you could even see the light from such a small fire that distance. They decided its the half zombie school president sending a message so they decide to sneak out and go the next night. It is literally miles away through the woods and they can magically travel the distance they had a hard time navigating in the sun light on their way out of the school. Like we are really supposed to believe that they can travel all the way there and back and sneak back into the quarantine camp in one night. Then school president shows up and suggests there are more like her and just jumps off the roof like she's superman even though they established the half zombies aren't invincible. This show was written by zombies I'm done.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,The first episode was difficult to watch due to bullying and sexual assault. To begin with the story draws you in and you want the characters to be able survive the zombies apocalypse.As the story continued the characters stories are all intertwined from a horrific event. The overall question became will theses characters be able to survive each other and zombies.,positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"This Korean serial surprised me a lot, through 12 episodes there was a lot of action and it was actually realistic then it could be. Seeing group of friends making decisions was interesting but in middle I kinda started being like what's going on. But when it was almost over of episodes the drama and decisions and things they had to do just survive or save theirs so called friends was something really good to see and it was probably 1st Korean serial that I've actually liked this much and watched it all day long, always thinking what they will do or what would happen even though some parts were predictable but still enjoyed this movie.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"The first couple of episodes was a bust, i was on the verge of quitting it but I decided to continue and I am glad I did. The reason as a lot of people said before me was the emotions in the first couple of episodes lacked, however further on their emotions do come out. Had some funny parts as well as sad parts. I enjoyed it so watch all the episodes before you rate it because it does get better.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,I would rate this close to TWD in writing and special effects - the story came up a little short and the Direction was a little slow at times but on balance a surprise to be sure. It took a couple of episodes to get into the characters but the inter stories were compelling - the show runner my have made a mistake in killing off too many of the characters but the primary ones survived and might give Netflix enough to go with another season - the ending was intriguing and left the door open for a second season with a whole new direction - I will watch it if it does and recommend it for those that are into Zombie movies - my wife isn't but she has other really good qualities.,neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I'd have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn't show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo's father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo's father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn't want to see them make another season.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt14169960,"What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? Well, let me just start off by saying that all the 1 star and 10 star reviews are wrong. This show has some flaws, but absolutely not enough flaws that would make it unwatchable.'All of us are dead' has this unique blend of comedic high school zombie action that, although used before, has not been achieved at this level of live-action television before. During the first episodes of my viewing, I definitely felt the typical ""how can they stretch this out to 12 episodes"", just to be proved absolutely wrong! The first episode is by far the worst, and with this usually being a red flag, it definitely is not here. 'All of us are dead' consumes the viewer, and already by episode 3 you will find yourself deeply attached to these characters, hoping none of them will die (except the bully) only to know that is not true.I believe the biggest strength to this show, is this attachment you will have towards these characters. With a massive cast of high school personalities, nearly all of them have a reason to cheer on their survival.'All of us are dead' often follows some typical tropes of zombie tv, but is filled with enough action and dialogue to make this feel fresh in its own way.If you can ignore some of the rare negative character actions, the not fully fledge out description of how the virus works, and the few repetitive scenes (such as the bully always reappearing again), then this show is a MUST WATCH for any zombie-lover.A complaint by reviewers which I found absolutely unnecessary was that some were shocked when certain characters died. One of the best things to come out of television in the past decade, was the unknownness of death brought on by shows such as 'Game of Thrones'. If you can't work past this inevitability of death, especially in a ZOMBIE show where one bite is the end, then why would you even start a show like this in the first place?Although I was not expecting or hoping there would be a season 2, the cliffhanger at the end makes me fairly certain there will be, and I am ok with that as long as it sustains some originality.Overall, by weighing all the negative and positives this show still maintains a solid 8 out of 10, but due to typical K-drama bashing, fake reviews, and hate due to unexpectedness, I will give this a 9/10!I am already wishing to re-watch it with a friend, just to see how and who they will form attachments too, as character attachment is needed for success!Thank you for this wonderful wonderful show, this was definitely a great way to start off 2022!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"Watching ""All of Us Are Dead"" is like watching someone else play a zombie video game, but the player controlling these characters makes them act, for lack of a more ridiculous term, ""silly"". Plainly, the characters go through woefully contrived motions for the sake of forced tension. By the fourth or fifth episode, I found it easy to root for the zombies, at least some of them had brains. Low hanging fruit, you know how I feel about zombie content. I finished the season because I had to.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,I really wanted to like this series. Interesting start. Lovable and hateable characters. Wayyyyyyyy overdrawn and annoying at times. They jumped the shark so many times.The plot holes are cavernous.It's so cheesy it's disgusting.It's pretty much anime in live action. Not in a good way.,negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"This show is absolutely one of the most craziest experiences I've had in a long while. From the get go there has not been a dull moment. Characters are introduced through exciting events which helps keep the viewers engaged. The encounters and instant interactions between the protagonist feel real as it would in an actual event. Even the decisions and behaviour traits portrayed by each character are fantastic and show in-depth character progression. Certain plot results may have not thrilled the fans as the build up for characters wouldn't always do them justice in the end, but I guess that's just how realistically the writers wanted to make the show appear. Overall, fantastic show!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"Really well-put together show.EXCELLENT VILLAIN and creative conflict.There are so many aspects to the conflict: bullying, killing, betrayal, friendship, survival, they literally thought of everything.The main story-line of the primary group of classmates was incredibly thrilling, but the side stories were just as good.We not only get multiple perspectives of the apocalypse, so that the whole show isn't just stuck inside of a school builing.I was so STRESSED watching this show though, mostly the second half. Some of the bad decision-making drove me up the wall, but the characters are so well-developed that I understood why they made their decisions.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I thought the cast worked hard and well. But I also thought this series could have been limited to about 8 eps at the most. For me there was too much repetition of Zombie tropes and cliches in the storyline as well as from the genre itself, and slow pace-often dragging itself along. Frankly, I got tired of the Zombies and am probably tired of the whole genre. That said, I really did like the cast, who made me care about them, which kept me watching. But still, the plot itself is predictable and underwhelming except for a few threads that touch the heart. It is okay, but no Train to Busan, Sweet Home, or Kingdom.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

ActionGoreSurpriseThe unexpectedand addressing the mundane questions we often mutter, but are not normally addressed - i.e. 'how do we go to the bathroom?'I really enjoyed this series. Each episode is quite long but giving enough time to learn about each character and the situation they are in.Just as you think you have guessed what will happen a curve ball is thrown and it takes a different route to the one you were expecting. In summary this is a series about zombie survival - a story which is way over played - but there is something about the series which tackles the subject in a different way.Characters are killed off you wouldn't expect to be killed off... gore happens when you don't expect it to happen... and the overall surprise of it all makes 'All of Us Are Dead' compelling viewing.If you enjoy zombie survival films then give this a try. 8 out of 10!",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"I enjoy the zombie premise but the characters talk way too much. One group literally spends entire episodes talking and not utilizing their surroundings for survival.A lot of high school drama. But mixed in with a lot of terrible adult storyline and acting. The show lacks focus.Coming off of the walking dead series, this show really focuses on running and not fighting. The constant running and bickering can get tiring.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt14169960,"Perfect? No, but def worth a watch, kinda addfictive.Zombies are very cool and scary, feel like Train to Busan zombies. I really don't understand why some people complain about them.Characters: they are many of them, some are more likable than others. What is nice is we never know who will die or not ; sometime a character got a big story but then die right after, sometime a ''secondary'' character (at first) will become important. So it's stressful when they are under attack, because we really don't know who will survive. Yea sometime they die in some weird/dumb way, but it would happen in a real zombie invasion. It's not alway super cool and heroic in my opinion.I don't agree when people complain that some characters just stand here and don't move. It's possible to be shocked when your best friend or dad or mom turn into a zombie. Not sure if you would do better, really.Perhap a bit too much teen drama for my taste, I was a bit annoyed at episode 7-8-9, but it's ok. I kind of agree that the serie could have been like 10 epiodes instead of 12.Not a fan of the pseudo intellectual jaded ideas of ''humanity is evil, bad so they deserve it'' and stuff.A good 8/10 for sure, try it.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Oh this series, I am in love with this. After long long time a Kdrama to get me hooked.The best thing of this show is How interesting the character of Lee Jae - Wook's is. I mean you expect typical historical/ Joeson character but no, he is completely different with great comic timing and seriousness when its needed.His flirting scenes with Mu Deok is so subtle.One more thing to add here, apart from the good CGI and different story, is that unlike every other historical show there is no rush to make lead couple fall in love immediately. Its new take on historical show. They hate, they curse, they fight, there are moments between them. I like it.Last but not the least, the female lead - Jung So Min's character is very strongly built and it is not getting faded in the course of romance.

tt20859920,"This review is based on the first 8 episodes as of now. I really hope it continues this way till the very end.It is a fantasy world that will feel utterly real to you. The plot , storyline, characters, direction, comedic timing, visuals , costumes, CGI , acting .. everything is just perfect.The only other fantasy story I loved this much was Harry Potter. The two are totally different in terms of story but they both are phenomenal works of art.The plot and character growth is absolutely brilliant. There has been a lot of thought put into every character. You'll find yourself caring for all the supporting characters as well.The male lead is charming, bold, funny and somewhat adorably childish at times. I also love his costumes. You'll find him dressed in magnificent shades of blue that are a treat to the eyes. I find myself constantly admiring the costumes and hair styles of the two leads.I love shows with a strong female characters and this one does not disappoint. The female lead can hold her own in the show. She is smart, pursues what she wants with a reckless boldness and is utterly refreshing to watch. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job than Jung So Min.Another thing I love about this show is how beautifully and effortlessly it changes from serious to funny within the blink of an eye. The background music and sound effects are perfect. I find myself laughing out loud in many places.All supporting characters are amazing too.The action and CGI is equally good. It keeps you on edge. One day I was literally banging on the table in front of me..

tt20859920,"I usually don't write reviews but this one is solely for Mu-deok (Jung So-Min).Writers created these intriguing characters but Mu-deok is simply a class apart and binds the story together. I never get emotionally invested in any character, but I kept cheering for Mu-deok throughout the season. It is a testament to Jung So-Min's acting skills that someone, with short attention span like me, binged watched entire season 1 in two days.Season 1 is a masterpiece you absolutely should not miss.However, I will never forgive the writers for the disastrous ending of season 1 which led to absolutely unnecessary season 2. I refuse to believe that writers as accomplished as Hong Sisters couldn't come up with better story for season 2 without killing Mu-deok.Entire season 2 makes you miss Mu-deok even more and reminds you why she was the ""soul"" of ""Alchemy of Souls"".",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"A magnificent fusion of adventure, fantasy, comedy and romance. Koreans, at their current rate, will dominate the world of entertainment in a very short time. Just stay away from the increasingly weakened and irritating contemporary Hollywood formula.

In South Korea, artistic talents erupt in profusion, names like Park Eun-bin, Park Min-Young, Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Gin are becoming easier to memorize in the western world every day. The screenwriters and directors demonstrate extreme competence in works that capture you from the very first chapters. Alchemy of Souls is no different, the beautiful and talented protagonist couple, Jung So-Min (Mu-Deok) and Lee Jae-Wook (Jang UK) get involved and involve the viewer in a story, which always leaves you wanting the next episode and who knows, a new season.

They keep pushing their limits and they are giving us truly amazing jewels with the fictional dramas.Im very used to historical dramas ( Sageuk) and I thought Alchemy of souls would be similar but with a touch of magic added to the mix ( something like Lovers of the Red Sky) but how wrong I was!This is a completely new magical universe creating new order of things and a world of fantasy ( although somehow women still were the prostitutes/gisaengs here, and all the students and soldiers were male but I won't complain a lot)I deeply enjoyed how well written the characters are, the layers and depth of each is just outstanding, needing to mention specially the crown prince (Shin Seung-ho ) whose constant internal struggle is just amazing to watch, he seemed the typical villain who is only mean and stubborn and is but was such a big surprise to getting to know him and seeing how he is so much more! I can't wait what comes next in the 2nd season.Why you should watch it?

tt20859920,"First and foremost I loved Alchemy of Souls and was its biggest fan, after finishing the first season I had given this show a 9/10 if not a 10/10. The first season had plenty of fight scenes, great character dynamics, interesting plotlines surrounding magic and world building, CGI magic and monsters with no expense spared in production, and complex female characters with their own powers. It was truly a feast for the eyes. Unfortunately, season 2 had to happen, and that gets a 7/10, maybe.Season 2 immediately changed the tone from happy to sad and emo, leaving many plot loopholes never fully answered. Additionally the plenteous fight scenes, world-building, soul shifters lore, and magical elements were all but gone.The new season also changed the female lead completely under confusing and illogical circumstances that I won't get into... but watchers were left with no longer a strong female lead but only the teasing description of one with ""untapped potential."" That potential was disappointingly never reached throughout the end of the series, and I never was able to see a strong female character again after the first few episodes of Season 1.Instead in Season 2 we were left with an all-powerful male character going through a depressive crisis, with some cute moments mixed in. Still, that story line and the confusing and unpredictable drama tied to it, was dragged out for way too long; especially considering this was a 30 episode drama. Simple issues ended up taking forever to resolve, and I was at the least hoping for a long and satisfying conclusion or maybe another season by the end of it. Wrong. They ended up dragging out that unfulfilling and overly-dramatic plot line-will they or won't they all die-until the very last episode. The happy ending was an afterthought, thrown in for possibly 10-15 minutes at the very end.Don't get me wrong, I am a sucker for a GOOD drama that plays with my feelings the whole while and then gives a long, satisfying, and good conclusion (Scarlet Heart Ryeo, Vincenzo, Itaewon Class). But this drama didn't do that, instead everything about the second season seemed like an afterthought that wasn't properly planned out. At this rate, just give me one season and don't waste my time with a second.I want to underline that this is no fault of the amazing cast of the show; I am still their biggest fan, but I am disappointed in the sloppy writing and production for what could've been so easily great. And furthermore, I am disappointed that certain characters were abandoned completely with no real reasoning.This serves as a warning for anyone going into this show, maybe stop after Season 1.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Season 1 is great until episode 19.5.Honestly the worst ending.Agree with some others who said that the writers forgot about their audience.What was the whole point of building such a great story in all those episodes, only to butcher it all at S01E20.That's how my heart felt.Brutally butchered.Didn't think I could watch S02, but gave it a chance anyway.8/10 episodes in, and I'm still wondering why they couldn't have written it slightly different for it to end in one 20-episode season.Season 2 does no justice to Season 1 (at least, so far). Sub plots like discovering(or not) that you're a bad cook? How does this add value to the show.....
Some things are moving too slowly, while some others are moving too fast.Plot holes get bigger, or get haphazardly filled.Totally disappointed.I don't know any of them, but I feel so badly for the actors and actresses.I don't know how to recommend this show.On one hand, almost every episode was great in S01, many heartwarming, tear-jerking moments. It had a little bit of every genre too, which blended really well to build what potentially could have been the greatest Korean TV drama.But be ready to have your heart be steam-rolled in episode 20..

Mu doek deserved better.The way they built up the premise in first episode of season 1 was good. Satisfying ending for Jang Gang also but tragic for both main characters.Crown prince character, Seo Yul, Dang gu were all good. Loved Master Lee. Supporting cast fabulous work. And Jin Mu and the queen played their role perfectly.Writers got tired i guess or were changed perhaps.

tt20859920,"First of all, I must say that Season 2 cannot get here fast enough! When the last episode ended, I literally groaned that I had to wait but was actually thrilled that this story was going to continue. Such a lush and beautiful story is too good to end here.Once again, the Koreans continue to prove why they are the most proficient storytellers in the world in film and television. I've been trying to think of another fantasy series that was heartfelt and full of luscious characters like this one. The ""Lord of the Rings"" film series is the only other one that comes to mind. That tells me just how incredible this series has been. And what makes this series soar is that it is story and character-driven. While it has some incredible special effects, they only enhance the core, which is what is supposed to happen in high-quality story-telling.In a fictional kingdom populated by mages, we have a power struggle going on to possess the ""ice stone,"" a stone of magic that can bring people back from the dead. Of course, anyone who seeks immortality would have a strong desire to possess such a relic. There is also a differentiation between magic and sorcery. Sorcery is forbidden magic that goes against nature itself. And one of the main devices of sorcery is soul-shifting. This means that a person dies but shifts their soul into another body. In some cases, soul-shifting can also mean trading bodies. This, of course, is forbidden magic.At the center of the story is Naksu, an infamous soul assassin who was hunted down by the mages of the kingdom. Mortally wounded, she is able to soul-shift into another body and take her identity; the identity of Mu Deok. However, because of her new body, she has no access to her energy in order to perform magic. In short, she's a regular person. However, her drive and desire to reacquire her energy and carry out her threat of killing those responsible for the deaths of her family members, is still very much at the forefront of her mind.We then have Jang Uk, a somewhat spoiled and lazy young man who is supposed to be learning various forms of magic, despite also being cut off from his energy due to an edict from his father. He's given no reason why, and so he spends much of his time lazing around and doing nothing until Mu Deok shows up and gets a job as his maid. However, it doesn't take Jang Uk long to realize Mu Deok's true identity, and he asks that she train him and become his master.One of the central themes of this story is what is more important? Power or Love? It's ironic that most people find love to be a weakness. What they fail to realize is that power without love IS weakness. Love is the most powerful force in the universe. This is something that Mu Deok must face and decide, which becomes an important factor when she is ultimately forced to decide what she wants: her power back or Jang Uk.The settings created for this series are absolutely incredible. I have to believe that most of the fictional towns are sets, and they are elaborate enough to rival any major film project.There are so many amazing performances in this series, that it is incredibly difficult to pick one that stands out from the rest. Lee Jae Wook (Jang Uk) and Jung So Min (Mu Deok) are absolutely fantastic and they have great chemistry together. One of my personal favorites was Kim Do Ju (Maidservant Kim) who was too exquisite for words. She is such a lovely woman, and her performance really stood out for me. However, the performance of Jo Jae Yoon as the villainous Jin Mu was captivating, to say the least. More often than not, a story is only as good as its villain. Imagine Star Wars without Darth Vader or Lord of the Rings without Sauron. They just don't work nearly as well, and Jo Jae Yoon gives a stellar performance as the villain behind the throne; the man pulling all of the strings. I've seen Jo Jae Yoon once before in ""Descendants of the Sun,"" but this role feels like it was tailor-made for him. He's deliciously evil and corrupt with little smirks that make you want to hit him. What makes his performance so grand is that he never plays Jin Mu in an over-the-top way. We have no angry outbursts or rage-filled speeches. He's calm, level-headed, and far brighter than people give him credit for.Of course, as with so many Korean series, we have moments of love, humor, inspiration, and even wisdom. Koreans are masters of character. They are always multi-leveled and multi-dimensional, much like real people.The fight scenes are all well-choreographed. Some of which reminded me a little of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I also like that they explain the magic. Robert Jordan, who wrote one of the most epic fantasy series of all time in his ""Wheel of Time"" series, is considered to have explained the science of his magic better than any writer ever. But Alchemy of Souls comes really close as we learn how magic and energy are used.This series is grand on an epic scale. Even a 20-episode series with each episode at an average of 75 minutes went by at a clip because I was so vested in the show. As I stated before, I cannot wait until the next series comes out. They ended things on a great cliffhanger that made me keep looking at the clock and going, ""Oh, no! It's almost over!"" Yeah, I didn't want it to end. For me, this is one of the best fantasy series I have ever seen, and frankly, it was the central theme of love and power that kept me coming back for more. And yes, I can't wait for more!",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

A magnificent East Asian mythology that seems to have been fused with the best elements of Shakespearean tragicomedy providing one of the best series that Netflix has to offer.The sets are sumptuous, the cast are incredibly gorgeous and the fight scenes choreographed to perfection.

tt20859920,"I am an European, but a fan of Korean tv shows. The first part with its 20 episodes belongs to the best I have seen yet: A great fantasy setting with a convincing world, a great story which is told in a very interesting way uncovering layer for layer, a very new take on a love story which is at the same time the story between master and study. So if you have seen episode 1-19 it is almost 10/10 (for me the music is often too syrupy and the comic relief sequences are sometimes a bit too clumsy to really reach the top).But in episode 20 they introduce new and vital information how the story world works and immediately make a very crude use of it. This is so embarrassing because up to this point all major plot elements have been carefully prepared in advance, often many episodes before they make use of them. It seems as if either someone else wrote this episode or they decided in the last minute to introduce these new plot hooks for the second part.Well, the second part is a mess in more than one aspect. First of all of they replaced the actor for the female lead (Jung So-Min). For twenty episodes you watched her in many scenes and many close-ups - and Jung So-Min is an very talented actress bringing the many aspects, the character is supposed to have, convincingly to life: She is sullen and dismissive, scornful, condescending, reluctantly affectionate, insolently submissive, tenderly concerned, full of love and desperate. And she can switch between all of them in a second and make you believe in the reality of the character. The new actress is not bad, but by far not as good as Jung So-Min. The chemistry between Jung So-Min and Jae-Wook Lee, who is also very good, makes the first part to something special. And somehow these feeling cannot be shifted to a new face.Add to this that the second part lacks the subtlety in plot building of the first and the ending has all the silly bluntness of the final scenes of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.It would be great to know why they botched this series which could have been a masterpiece so badly. And who are they?",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"The first 20 episodes were well acted with interesting plot twists and character development. The second season was the exact opposite: bad acting and muddled plot development . I couldn't believe the absurd attempt to expect the audience to buy into the characters foisted on the public. Even the actors themselves looked like they were suffering. The ending was so bad it could only have been scripted to placate a fan base demanding a ""happy ending"". What were the Hong sisters thinking? The acting was so lackluster that it was hard to watch . I had watched the first season three times it was such a pleasure. I hated the second season to the degree that I will never ever watch the first season again. There was too much repetition of familiar memes in the second season that it became boring and I had to fast forward to stop yawning.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Season 1 (10/10): The first season is a really good season, probably the best historical/fanatasy drama I have ever seen. The storyline is just really unique and pulls you in fairly quickly. The balance between comedy, romance and action is just perfect. The characters are all really charismatic and interesting. You get to see many different stories develop through the characters and you grow to love most of them. My favorite thing about this series are the visuals. The whole series is just like eye-candy. I could honestly watch this series just because of the visually pleasing scenes. The graphics are amazing as well. And the soundtrack really just pulls it all together.Season 2 (7.5/10): The second season continued with the great visuals, but something just felt a little off compared to the first season. The first episode in this season was a great starter, but episodes 2-7 weren't honestly that interesting. I feel like the story only started to take off in episodes 8-10. Don't get me wrong, the second season was still decent, but it just didn't live up to the same standard as the first one.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt20859920,"I watch parts 1 and 2 back to back. Like many, I was disappointed by the last two episodes of part one. That was simply because I wanted a happy story resolution. The writers could easily have done that but logically expanded the story to its next logical step. If I had to wait a season between parts, I would have been devastated. Fortunately I didn't have to do that, going straight to the second part. I was tremendously rewarded.In total, there's 30 episodes, each running up to an hour and a half. That is a massive amount of story!!!I'll keep it short. This series, even when viewed as a dub, is one of the best, if not the best (depending on the day) televised programs that I have ever been privileged to watch. The writing was incredibly well done. The world building was intricately developed. The acting was top notch. The production and music was excellent.I can't recommend this more highly. Absolutely superb.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I have to also give praise to the writers and director.........their talent is over the top and I know the second season will not disappoint! I am in awe over the amazing story telling by the writers and the directors ability to convey the writers story from the written words to the big screen where the characters come to life.Finished the second season.......boy was I amazed that the second season was just as good if not better than the first season!

I know that one of the two seasons is now English dubbed, but ever hopeful for both seasons. Everything is superb. You'll find yourself watching at least twice because the sets, camera work, costumes = all Oh my are so good that you have to watch it again just for the entertainment value.

So I looked forward to Season 2, only to witness it descending into a lovey-dovey stare fest with a lamp that keeps lighting and going out. I kept saying ""get a move-on for goodness sake"". I suppose there is a power struggle going on but often the lines of demarcation are blurred And the ubiquitous grey-haired villain pretty much plays the part he was born to play.

S02 is rushed, it has plenty of plot holes and there are plenty of scenes which simply do not go along with the rules set up in S01. The cinematographic part (but cut!) is doing well and actors are amazing. But again, I would expect, as we had a possibility to see Jin Buyon's adult body through all S01, that instead of the child, they make cameo of Jung So Min.

We never get to see the feared assassin style on her enemies instead she leaves it because ""she has left that life"". We could have gotten a power duo instead we got the stereotypical fantasy male and female power pairing.

I was expecting naqsu and jang uk to actually fight together and killing soul shifters and enemies. But the personalities have completely changed and become lesser interesting.It would have been better for me if sul had just climbed the tree with mu deouk in season 1. They just dragged to complete the story and rather lost the true essence of an amazing story.For me alchemy of souls ended at season 1.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Although the production values are very high and the SFX are done well, what I enjoy most about this series is that it focuses primarily (and very interestingly) on the relationships between the characters, with an emphasis on romantic relationships. In so doing, it pushes the boundaries of gender relationships in atypical ways for this genre (for example, in Part One the lead male character becomes the disciple of the lead female character). Women have very central and powerful roles in this series, a break with tradition which I very much enjoy. The acting is also first-rate. Highly recommended.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"I think this is my most favourite TV show ever.I LOVED the fantasy and the creativity of the different magic that can happen in that fictional world.I loved the awesome fighting scenes, their fictional moves were cool and general fighting was great- although the fighting scenes maybe could have been a little longer at times personally I love watching cool stunts and martial arts.Every single character was awesome!! I loved them all but if i had to choose, my favourite character was the physician Heo Yeom, he was so funny and cute. And obviously all 3 friends Jank UK, Seo Yul and Park Dan Juk because they were such cool mages, so powerful and had big hearts (kind people).But the main thing I loved was the fantasy world, the writers could do so much with that world i think, they could write so much more about the different types of magic there is, the different relics they have etc. Etc. - in my opinion they could turn it out in many many seasons. Even exploring different characters more and how they came to what they are like Master Lee Cheol and Park Jin ... though I would miss seeing Jang UK and Naksu! Or another evil could arise and Naksu and Jang UK are involved in trying to stop that.The romance between Jan UK and Naksu/ Mudeok was adorable and very endearing, I just wanted to watch more! And it made my heart warm!I was slightly dissapointed how little we saw of Jang Uk's father, he was SUCH a cool character, they could have done much more with that.But the overall story throughout the two seasons was so captivating!!!! I'm a little ashamed to say this, but want to compliment the writers and actors so I will admit I was literally addicted to this show! I couldn't stop watching it, I would go to bed so late evrry night just to watch more because it was so captivating! ( I normally do not go to bed late!)
I watched the whole 2 seasons pretty quick, I think in 2 weeks.Lastly, all the actors were perfect in my eyes. They played really believable characters. Great acting. And nearly all of them were gorgeous/ handsome 😍.Recently I have seen SOME actors in American TV shows who are not genuine or believable to me.. and it ruins the show a little (I am English and watch a lot of Amercian tv shows)... but I did not get that from this show.

Season 2 didn't had the same chemistry between the character and the storyline was dragging a lot.

The story line kept me intrigued throughout the entirety of the show and the plot twists were simply scrumptious.Styling and cinematic/visual effects are crucial for me and this drama did not miss. The music was also well done.There is one tiny plot hole though but it's pretty easy to ignore. Basically, the king impregnated Do-hwa in Jang Gang's body which led to her giving birth to the late king's son, Jang Uk.

I didn't, however, like the dialogues - both seasons have the characters talking in riddles and not really getting to the crux of the discussion. This may just be how they ""prolong"" the series.Season 2 started off well but episode 3 onwards, things get super confusing and unnecesaarily complex.

After 20 heart-wrenching episodes, in the new season we practically watch the main actor fall in love with a new character, making us feel disgusted with him too, because we all fell in love with mu-deok while watching her as the main character in first 20 episodes who is not there in the second season. And not only the different actor,but whole different charakter too.btw, I can put up with the slow pace and the fact that nothing happens in most of the episodes, but they made a second season in which there are only a series of frustrating scenes, it simply stops being watchable and I easily lost the will to watch the series which was fantastic at first.without almost any happy or hopeful scene, it's just a series of bad things happening.

tt20859920,"When I first saw Naksu, I was disappointed because I thought real Naksu was more beautiful than real Jin Buyeon. But as So Min played Jin Buyeon intelligently, I fell more for So Min as fake Naksu because, even though she lived in Buyeon's body, the Naksu character that was so cold, mean, and straight can be well reflected by So Min.. Combining the real body of Jin Buyeon who was weaker in physical ability and with Naksu's spirit was super enjoyable. I used to wonder how Naksu would return to her full life, but Buyeon had to die for that. It's a sad fact, and I actually wasn't prepared for it.Surprisingly, the plot is twisted in S2, where two souls can be still alive as well as Bu Yeon's body but with Naksu appearance.. but I wasn't ready with the player change.. and as I tried to adapt with that look change, but I then also wasn't ready for the character change.. it is so upturned.. and how the new Jang Uk can also easily fall and be romantic, I somehow felt the new but real Naksu just stole all the fruit of the old but fake Naksu's (Mu-deok) love struggle with Jang Uk... and for that I felt betrayed. Because Jang Uk was previously a difficult-to-fall-in-love person, despite having a warm heart. Jang Uk in fact could only fall for someone who had Jin Buyeon's body and Naksu's spirit, which was reflected as Mu-deok in the S1 storyline.. In real life, there is a typical of people like that, which made them interesting and special....Hence, If we adhere to the storyline, Jang Uk will first pursue someone who resembles Mu-deok, and then check for the presence of blue spark eyes (there was a scene that applied), whereas if girl does not resemble Mu-deok. If the two conditions are not met, Jang Uk will continue to search for Naksu's soul in order to fall in love again. Unfortunately, in S2, Jang Uk falls in love with someone who is extremely attractive and appears to have Mu-Deok's memory. Even though Jang Uk appears moved by the memory of the new Naksu, which leads him to consider loving her, this goes against Jang Uk's previous storyline. Furthermore, S1 is more humorous, with romantic bickering, whereas S2 is more serious, sadder and has a far way too easy ending.Actually, I think I can accept new Naksu as long as Mu-deok can be remembered appropriately and when switching to the new Naksu should be played more smoothly, because after all, Mu-physic deok's can't be reappeared due to ""her crime"" at the end of S1... but sadly, not only does saying Mu-name deok's seem illicit in S2, the storyline is also forced. Made me only want to finish S2 just to be able to move on to other drama.. I hope no other producers made this kind of mistakes again in the feature...Overall, I love every characters there, and especially the storyline of how Jang Uk finally achieve his masterpiece skill ..",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

They could of had the perfect ending but the hong sisters just decided to give it all up. The second season wasn't that great in my opinion. I wish they would of had a really emotional and heartbreaking reunion, but they just acted like nothing had changed and they didn't care.

tt20859920,"... a complete disappointment.A 10 out of 10 for Part one. It was a great tale.But part 2, I really get the feeling that they had to alter the story line to make up for not having Jung So-Min for part two.It just did not make sense.Naksu trapped in the body of Bu-Yeon, a priestess with godly divine powers, which prevented Naksu to run wild. Yet all it took was a set of bells to take care of that.But I could have lived with that as she could easily be revived with the ice stone.The whole part 1 actually seemed to build up to that. Part 2 just inconsistently applies reasoning for things to be as they are then, while they never appeared in part 1.Bu Yeon's appearance is like Naksu now, instead of Mu-Deok. Why? Because only Naksu's soul is now in her body. (it can be questioned if Bu Yeon's soul was actually in Mu-Deok in part 1) Mu-Deok's appearance did not change, and nor did any other soul changer's body.Master Lee is suddenly capable of depetrifying a soul changer's body, while in part 1, one would need the ice stone to do that.Yes Master Lee reached Hwansu, but if that equals the usage of the ice stone, then Master Lee could have solved all problems easily in part 1.We can increase the list of inconsistencies from part 2, but I will end my rant just to state my dissappointment:There has never been a series that I viewed that got me this bad. Usually I would shake my head and move on, but this time, I am so annoyed by it, it is hard to let go. I just cannot understand why they took this route. Perhaps they could not book Jung So-Min for part 2, but it would have been so much better to delay part 2 until she was available again.Jang Uk is being put forward as the main character, but in reality Mu-Deok was the main character. She carried part 1, I think the makers really underestimated that.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

I didn't even move when I watched it because every episode was so interesting.When season 1 ended, I was so happy knowing that there's gonna be s2, I counted the days for it to come.Aaaand surprise surprise, WOW I was just sitting there confused of what I was watching. So many plot holes, every week I tried to be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt. But holy cow, it was just a huge disappointment.How can anyone let this happen in S2? I guess the writers' original souls from S1 have shifted completely and their bodies were being taken over by Patrick star from SpongeBob. That's the only explanation I can think of. Wow.. I honestly believe that ALCHEMY OF SOUL IS REAL now, thanks to the insane shift from S1 to S2.I just finished the entire season 2 and I am just LOST for words.

From the first episode, I was skeptical, because the last couple of years after Netflix entered the Korean market, very mediocre series have been coming out, but this one is perfect! Beautiful actors, an interesting plot, costumes and locations are chosen just fine. I look forward to every episode and it only gets more interesting with each episode!

Naksu is a feared assassin who becomes trapped in the body of a blind girl (Jung So-min) who goes to work as a servant to Jan uk (Lee Jae-work) who is from a noble family of mages. The story has a complex plot that evolves over time and my only criticism would be that in episodes near the end the story stalls as we see explanations of what's going on. Great cast and an interesting storyline makes it an enjoyable watch, although I am concerned about season two as some of the great lead characters will not star in the follow up and even though I am sure it will be ok they will not be able to replicate the lead chemistry we had in this.Update on season 2:

To put it mildly I think her performance in that episode was expressionless and emotionless with no charisma.Indeed I was not at all impressed of this drama before Naksu's soul shifted to Mu-Deok and Jung So Min game along.

tt20859920,"I am very seldom impressed by films or series. I may like them more or less, but the Alchemy of Souls is an exception. It is a master piece.The storyline is complex but never ever does it lack logic (which in fact reminds me of Babylon V. It is the only other series, although from an entirely different genre, that never lost a thread. Everything eventually lead to an explanatory conclusion even if you had to wait several series for it). The story telling is also stringent and covers every aspect needed to be compelling. It is very exciting, sweet, has many twists, occasionally gruesome but all together it forms a cohesive stroy line which makes you long for the next episode.The acting is formidable as is the photography and scenography. It is beautiful!Without offending American viewers I hope, it must be said that it is clinically free from American cultural stereotypes and ways of telling a story on the screen. I find this wildly exciting not to say refreshing. The same cannot be said for the other grand media event of late: The Rings of Power (I have reviewed this as well).So, as far as Alchemy of Souls go, I have nothing negative to say. It is simply wonderful no matter from what perspective. It is simply a must-watch series providing an insight into an entirely different kind of story-telling than most Western viewers are accustomed to.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

tt20859920,"I wanted to give this show a 1 out of 10, because the ending of episode 20 actually ruined the entire show. But that would be unfair to the actors and actresses who all did a phenomenal job. The writers however, do get a 1 out of 10 for the garbage ending. This is the first time I've ever felt an ending was so bad that it ruined an entire show in retrospect.I really enjoyed season 1 of the show. Season 1 gave it's viewers a lot of magic, lore, world building, and plots that stretched credulity, a lot of near misses and a lot of drama that allowed us to see the heroes escape with barely the skin on their backs. There was this feeling that goodness will always prevail and conquer evil. Then the last 30 minutes of season 1 happened. Why on earth would the writers ruin everything they built?I won't go into too many details but why give your viewers a sweeping and epic romance, where Love and sacrifice conquers all in every episode only to rip it away from your viewers' hearts at the end of the season? Suddenly I felt like I wasted my time watching the show and regretted the 20 hours I spent watching every episode because the end result was so unfulfilling, made even more unfulfilling because they completely abandoned this great love story in season 2. I could live with ep 20, if the original love story had been resurrected. (Edit to note, I finished season 2 after the initial shock of of the bad ending of S1 and enjoyed it despite the nonsensical storyline).I was hoping this was one of those situations where the heroes would overcome evil. The fact that the royal family and all the mages would even listen to the bad guy after all the evil he had done was extremely bad writing, all the while punishing the good guys for every single thing that went wrong. Even giving one character who had been honorable the whole time, a bad or dishonorable funeral for one mistake while forgiving the bad guy who engaged in many egregious and highly unforgivable acts.When the writers throw away something, like a love story that they spent an entire season building, only to rip it away from their viewers, is it because the writers think they're cool because they tried to write a Shakespearean level tragedy hoping their viewers will complain about how much they miss the character? If so, it is the height of arrogance. We don't just miss the characters, it makes us hate and resent the show. It really irritates me because these sort of tragedies are not fun or enjoyable to the viewers. I watch for happy ending, or at least the characters ending up together even if they're not fully happy with everything. The viewers have stopped caring about your characters and stop caring about the show because they've lost the whole reason why they were watching it in the first place.I really detest shows where a bad guy keeps getting forgiven for every wrongdoing they have done and no matter how egregious their sins are they are forgiven but if the heroes make one mistake they are punished severely while the bad guy continues to get away with murder. I felt that the heroine was not treated properly at all and as a result neither were the viewers. I would say that the writers even betrayed the viewers because the story feels like a sadistic lie. I could not focus on season 2 because of the new female lead and of course she is a beautiful and lovely young lady but I feel that is why they wanted her there, for no other reason except that she is younger than the heroine of season 1. They took a great character and replaced her with a very generic young beauty which is just boring. I started season 2 but I doubt I will finish it. I'm already scanning for a new show. I think the male lead, playing Jang Uk is fantastic and I watched mostly for the energy he brought to the show. The way their characters were treated in ep 20 was just awful. What a disservice to him. The lead actress in Season 2 did grow on me, and I grew to like her eventually, to her credit. I did want more from the romance aspect of the story, to hopefully make up for the shock of season 1 ending so poorly, but id grade the romance somewhere in the middle for season 2. The lead male actor was also very good in season 2 but he somehow managed to look even taller and more ganglier than he did in season 1, probably due to some noticeable weight loss.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

The story was flowing, intriguing and interesting. Then come SEASON 2 and everything started going downhill. As per now where I have been patient thinking it will be better in the coming episodes, I have completed lost hope and not intrigued anymore. The characters don't work well together, the chemistry is lacking and the storyline just doesn't cut it for me anymore and this could be bcoz the characters don't bring out the storyline line well anymore.

Alchemy of Souls has been entertaining thus far; a supernatural martial arts period drama (a la Crouching Tiger) that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's about mages who practice forbidden magic allowing them to swap souls, potentially staying youthful via swapping into younger bodies, but at the risk of turning into petrifying zombies.The leads (and main supporting cast) are very charming and affable, especially the character of Mu Deok played by Ms Jung So Min, who is particularly great at sarcasm. As I really enjoyed Uncanny Counter & Sky Castle , it was great to see those cast members here.It's similar in tone & as thrilling as Stranger Things. Netflix really knocked it out of the park in 2022 w/ 25 to 21, All of us are Dead, Tomorrow, Stranger Things 4, and now Alchemy. Some K Dramas don't have enough content to fill 16 episodes, all 20 of season 1 flew by.Point deducted only for the awkwardly hammy acting of Seo Hye Won, who plays the pickpocket So-i. She was hilarious in Business Proposal, but was distracting here.Wonderful score and soundtrack.S2: still fun, fingers crossed it has a satisfying conclusion.9.5/10 A+",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Ultimately, that's what it was.I've been asking myself what in the world was it...is it about the Korean romance fantasy, Alchemy of Souls, that hooked me? Here I am a baby boomer in the USA, but boy did this Netflix series hook me and launch an absolute fan.So I suggest watching it; especially if you are a lover of romance, metaphysics and fantasy, with tasty bits of comedy sprinkled in.I am not a person who likes dark stories ... with dark beings just for the sake of the Dark; feeding that part of human nature that is mesmerized by the power that exist there. I don't like blood and gore; although this one has blood not so much gore. It also has some of the darkest beings... but there is a level of substance that delivers so much more. Character. True friendship. Endurance. Loyalty. Love that will not die.So once again I say, do yourself a favor and watch Alchemy of Souls. Netflix has dubbed the first season in English and I'm hoping the second season which contains the last episodes, and aired here in the West this past weekend, will be dubbed in English soon.There are 30 episodes in all. The actors are excellent and most often beautiful. The storyline superb.

tt20859920,I watched the previous season and it was great . I was wanting for the session 2 and finally got the season. Can't explain how glad i am 😍. Keep doing good job. It's seem my move lover life finally fulfilled. Thanks to all the actor and team of this dram. The first one was too much good and i watched two of the new season . Hope the bew season will last long at least 15 or 20 can be ok . But 10 it is really sad News for me . However thanks the writer and publisher as well. It will always in my favorite drama's list. Thanks Netflix for publish the drama and give us opportunity to watch this kind of masterpiece. Thanks a lot.,positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"This is a fun and entertaining fantasy-based K-drama. The story and characters follow familiar K-drama formula (or perhaps a live-action anime adaptation), but there's nothing wrong with that. Very easy story to get into. Although some call this a ""historical"" fantasy, this is not based on any actual Korean history. There has never been a kingdom called Daeho, nor mages or soul shifters in Korean mythos as depicted in the show. It is still a very creative expansion of the fantasy genre, leveraging the beautiful architecture and colorful costumes of the Korean tradition.The actors are quite likable and the humor is enough to provide some comic relief, not too much to ruin the show. You'll recognize the pattern of characters if you watch enough of these K dramas. What makes or breaks is the chemistry, and I think they did a good job with this cast.Special effects throughout the series are not overdone. Swordplay and action sequences look to be reasonably well choreographed, though clearly it's not the main theme of the show. The usual court and family intrigue is there.I'm binging through this and enjoying it! Worth watching.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"I literally can't with this team. Season 1 is m one of the greatest shows of ALL time. What the ef happened to the production, writing & editing staff in season 2?! This drama had sooooo much potential in S01, even after the controversial ending. But then they (and I'm blaming the writers here) write a basic plot and ruin EVERYTHING.I stayed through S02 because S01 hooked me in. Honestly, shotty CGI and bad cinematography can be excused IF YOU HAVE A GOOD WRITING STAFF. I don't know if the staff from S01 was fired or what, but whoever is responsible for this change: you're an id*ot.An example of the bad writing: They did the women so wrong in S02. Since this is officially a rant: I can't believe that I spent months telling people to watch this Kdrama over the summer, only for them to devolve this badly in S02.The epilogue was the only good part of S02.",negative,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

The entire story is so beautiful, the different love relationships are fantastic, romantic, funny and at the same time you treat each character to their love. Especially valet Kim is my secret favorite, you just have to love her. Jang Uli is a dream, his transformation, his charm and his overall charisma take the viewer on his journey. The lead actor fits perfectly and he's just great to look at. But I have to say that I liked the main actress better in the first season, she was the right counterpart to the main actor. Unfortunately your affection came very late, you could hardly breathe and suffered in every episode. Season 2 was very confusing until you understood everything. The ending was great and satisfying.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"I'd give this one a 9/10 (because 10/10 is too ideal for anything), but there are flaws.What's good is a decent story, great decorations and costumes, good actors and likeable characters.What I didn't like is that many times the comedy elements dragged for too long and it undermined more serious core plot. That in fact in my opinion is what denied this show to end sensibly in its allocated episodes. Even prolonged last episode contained too much comedy, when it should've at least tried to be more serious. I hope the continuation will tie all loose ends and make a decent finale this show's story and characters deserve.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

It has mystery, action, romance, fantacy. Sometimes the scenario takes slower steps but you don't get bored, it gets you action when you don't expect it. But what I really loved it was the comedy, where these powerful wizards have their funny has (human as usual) moments..!Although I am not a critic, I would say excellend job from the actors.I would rate it with 10 starts but I got really angry that they made the summer prince to cry.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"So I really liked season one although was very disappointed in the season finale. There was no resolution to not only the main plot but any of the lesser character subplots. It ended with not a single satisfaction. I generally don't mind a Cliff hanger, but you have to give us something hopeful.Regarding season two, I see many are unhappy with it. However, I don't belive their complaints are anywhere near the mark. I think the series was ruined for many by the season finale. Season two is just as good as season one. However, this is because season two is exactly the same as one. Exact same plot and character subplots, love stories etc. EXACTLY the same. All the headway they seemed to be making in the first season start all over from scratch in the second. Season two is basically the exact same story in everyway. It is very annoying. My only hope after 6 episodes is that this season will actually have a satisfying ending. Just a few episodes left for redemption.It is beautifully shot and well acted. The English dubbing was also done well.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"I, like many, would've been introduced to K-drama via tiktok. For many, squid games.Truth be told, I never wanted to venture into Asian dramas as I was a victim to many terrible Japanese dramas during many visits to a relative and sadly, I thought it was a regional thing.Oh my.... How wrong I was.American dramas that offer magic and tongue in cheek humour usually have that and some yeah... Blatant side effects. This is certainly way above that level.The costumes, the sets, humour, makeup and stunts are brilliant. Okay, the effects are... Because it's magic, blatant. But even at that, you can tell a greater amount of creativity and effort went into it than the general TV shows like grimm etc.To conclude, only watched the first season so far. Not usually the genre I would go for unless I've been subjected to it by someone else. But it's by far the most enjoyable I've experienced for a very long time. Storyline is great. Characters are strong. Interactions are good. And well I've already mentioned the others.I will say though, the only downfall is sneak previews at the end of each episode and the introductions also as they change every episode. So, skip intro and as soon as the episode ends, exit and go to the next if you want to avoid.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"
tt20859920,"Forgive me for being verbose, but I am excited that I no longer have to depend on American television, which has not been all that great this past decade!I also must preface my review by stating that I am not into Korean idols, pop, or Korean Dramas. I didn't know who any of these actors/actresses were before watching the show. To be honest I still do not know who they are, but I will look out for the lead male& female in other films/shows, because they are incredible!I love historical fantastic dramas!This show was recommended to me after I was advised to watch the Glory and from there I found Alchemy of Souls!!!The show was excellent! The writing was great, the special effects, the plot, *the sword play, the magical elements, but it was the character development& acting that made this show more than just great! The chemistry between the main actors as well as the secondary characters was stellar!I have only written one other review regarding a show where I was just as pleased with the cast, which was TLK. This show did something that only they have been successful in doing imo; they revealed the main characters through those around them and built a special attachment with the audience with most of the cast.Review
It is very difficult to hide major plot points through secondary characters without it coming off as a convenient& lazy way to push the plot forward. It never felt as if the writers depended upon these cheap tricks rather the plot is intricate and immersive.I must admit that the first season was my favorite in terms of storyline, and it had a perfect balance between comedy& drama.However, the progression of Jung Uks' character throughout the first season into the second was a perfect display of character growth& development. He went from being this hopeful, naive, and immature Mage to a somewhat broken, powerful hero! Which makes perfect sense if you've watched the show. He has a depth to him that he lacked in the first season, and the writers couldn't have done a better job at switching the roles between Junk Uk and Naksu in terms of who they were to one another.Naksu, due to her memory loss, was akin to Jung Uk in the first season; hopeful, joyous, naive! She became a light to him, and the one who wanted to protect him contrasted to the first season where Junk Uk protected her& was always hopeful.Although I was disappointed in the switching of lead actresses, I never felt like Naksu was a different person to Mu Deok; they just looked different.I was also impressed with the love story; no matter what body she inhabited; they would still find and love one another.I must boast about the lead Actor, and I hope for either a third season or too see him again, because he is an incredible actor and has gained a fan of his work.",positive,"Action, Drama, Fantasy"

Some people might say it's too confusing and not realistic. Well, the title itself says "" what if we sort out psychopaths in advance"", you can't expect a simple plot, documentary movie.

tt13634792,"This type of series and movies are the reason why I just love this genres. And this series is such a masterpiece. Its dark, its raw, it just defines this genre in the best way.REVIEW : This is a series that is not for the people with weak heart. If you love a series with happiness, with love, with perfect beautiful ending..then I will suggest that you should not watch it.Coming back to the series, right from the beginning, from the very first scene...each and every scene and episode is connected till the very ending, the very last scene. Right from the beginning..when the story starts.. slowly you start getting questions with each and every passing scene... and by episode 12-14 you are just filled with it. You are confused, you don't understand anything about what is happening, who is doing what, why its happening and many more such questions. And right from then you start getting the answers. All the dots start to get connected. Everything starts making sense. All your questions starts getting the answers for what you were wanting so long. All your assumptions starters getting to prove wrong. Everything you have thought just turns out to be wrong. You have to watch the very last episode..the very last scene so get all the answers. To get everything clear. To understand the story totally.This is a type of series where you have to keep your eyes and brain open. And if you don't understand korean then you have to make sure that you read each and every word that you see in the subtitles. Because if you miss anything, then you will not be able to understand anything after that... That's how connected each and everything is in this series ?.I must say that makers did a great job. The way everything is portrayed..its just brilliant. Actually I honestly don't know what is the correct word to describe the brilliance of this series. Its just mind blowing ?.ACTORS AND ACTING : Everyone, literally everyone did a great work. No matter how big or small was their appearance was, but every character have a strong impact. Non of the character was just for nothing. All the characters were equally important and meaningful. There was no unnecessary drama. That's what make it more amazing. You don't feel bore.The actors did not just played the roles, they lived that. You can feel their emotions through their eyes. All the pain can be seen in their eyes.LEE SEUNG GI (JUNG BA REUM): He is the person around whom the whole story moves. The main person who is the creator or the destroyer.. whatever you say?. The acting skill of this man, my God. He is just amazing in what he is doing. The way he presents his character..the ups..the downs..the shock. Everything he feels just gets transferred o you with his eyes. You find him wrong in the starting but then by the end you feel pity on him. You feel sorry for him. You feel that he didn't do whatever he did with his own wish, he just didn't had any option but just to do all those things even if he was wrong.LEE HEE JOON (KO MOO CHI) : This is his revenge story. The person who suffered right from the childhood because of no reason. He is the one who did everything to solve the mysteries. To get the people punished because of who his life was filled with pain. You can see that pain right in his eyes, in his body language, in each and everything he do. You can see his desperation of how bad he want to get them punished.PARK JOO HYUN (OH BONG YI) : The girl who faced a horrible incident in her childhood and slowly overcome it with the passing time. She is brave, courageous, loving, caring, understanding. She is the common but special girl. She one of the main character that holds a lot of meaning in the entire drama. A girl who struggled a lot. Bear all the physical and mental pain and still stands up to fight again.KYUNG SOO JIN (CHOI HONG JOO) : According to me, this is the person who the most mysterious. You have to watch the entire series to know about this person. She will keep on giving you surprises till the very end. By the way she is very beautiful ?.KWON HWA WOON (SUNG YO HAN) : The most innocent character of the entire series. The one with whom everything was so unfair. Like everything. He was the one who was just caught in the middle of every thing. Right or wrong. Who is the main character who is involved with everything in a different way.BACKGROUND MUSIC : The music is so deep, dark and it totally matches with the plot..the storyline. It adds more meaning and intensity to it. Its so catchy.RE-WATCH VALUE : If you ask me, honestly I may not watch it again as its a thriller-suspense-mystry series. And one you discover everything in the first time.. watch it again for the second time is no fun. But yes, if you are watching it with a friend then ya..you can watch it again. It will be fun to see his reaction with every surprise ?.CONCLUSION : This is a must watch for every suspense lover. Just don't miss it.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"7.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean mystery, crime, thriller television series with 20, 70 Minute, episodes.There is a serial killer on the loose and no-one feels safe. After his mother and father are victims, Ko Moo Chi (Song Min-jae) bravely identifies the killer causing one of the most notorious killers to be sent to prison. Fast forward and now Ko Moo Chi (Lee Hee Joon) is a detective who will stop at nothing to get the bad guy. He is on a personal mission to put as many killers behind bars as possible. It seems there is a new serial killer whose crimes rival the brutality of the ""head hunter"" the killer who killed Chi's parents. After several chance encounters with another police officer officer, Jetong Ba-reum (Lee Seung-gi) who is known for his good deeds and many, including Chi, wonder if he has what it takes, in terms of a hardened personality, to make it as a homicide detective. Nevertheless they team up to stop this new serial killer. Oh Bong-yi (Park Ju-hyun) sees Ba-reum as stability in a life that has been far from stable. Their romantic pairing is something her grandmother wished for seeing handsome and kind Ba-reum as a perfect pairing for her granddaughter who is haunted by a traumatic past. Choi Hung-ju (Kyung Soo-jin) is an investigative journalist specializing in stories about killers. Her work has her working with Detective Chi frequently and he values her opinion. They were once romantically interested in each other but life events drove them apart. Will they catch the killer through their combined efforts before he can kill many more? Is everyone who they seem?Spoiler alert***
What I liked about this series. It went very in depth on the psychology behind psychopathy. It showed very clearly how some psychopaths are experts at blending in with ""normal"" people and how those closest to them can be fooled. I liked the relationships between friends, former lovers, and even the interplay between the serial killers and the police. I thought all of the actors played their roles very well.What I did not like about this series:
1) It was so complex that it made the story hard to follow at times. The plot twists were frequent and you had to pay careful attention to things that may have happened several episodes ago or you may miss the significance of the latest twist. It caused me to tune out several times to let the story play out a little bit and get back to normal.2) I did not like the inconsistencies. For example the killer was a psychopath even as a child and had one of his father's mice (assumed). But if the mouse was his father's it did not make sense as he was in school when it showed him with the mouse and his father was put in jail before he was born. So, where did he get the mouse as a small child? Another inconsistency was when Bong-yi was rescued as a child by Ba-reum. He gives her a piggy back ride and they seemed to be about the same age. However, earlier in the show the Bong-yi commented on their age gap and it seemed to be significant, like maybe 10 years.3) An event with new characters would happen in one episode and seem to conclude then several episodes later they would mention the names of the people involved in the episode. By the time I would figure out what event they were referencing, the story would have moved along.4) I did not like that I felt I had no one to root for. I like Ba-reum early on but when he turned out to be bad, I was very disappointed. The rest had some serious character flaws, Bong-yi jumped to conclusions, Chi wanted to kill the bad guys and be judge, jury and executioner, and Chung-ju does not open up to anybody.5) Loose ends. There were a lot of unexplained things. Such as the mouse, why did Ba-reum have a mouse. The mouse almost seemed to be controlled by Ba-reum when it attacked the snake - what was that about? We also never got the full story of what transpire to PD Choi as a young child. What happened to her brother? How did the serial killer get her to work with him? The Oz organization was mentioned frequently but when things wrapped up we never got the full story of who all belonged to Oz and why they joined. The pregnant lady who was identified as having a child with the psychopath gene at the same time that Ba-reum's mother was, what happened to her and her child? There were so many psychopaths it was hard to keep track of who was who.6) Romance died. I know it was never fully intended to be a romance but there was a cute romance developing between Ba-reum and Bong-yi and then we found out the truth about him and that was that, as it obviously would be. But then even Detective Chi and PD Choi, they had a romance in the past and, at the end, Detective Chi indicates to another detective he still has feelings and might confess but then PD Choi and he sit down and talk about their feelings of guilt over the way things played out with the doctor. They sort of agree it sucks and they will live with that guilt then she just walks away and he drives off into the sunset in his egg truck. Felt like we had build up in both cases only to be let down in the end.7) There was a lot of emphasis put on the psychopath gene and, while they mentioned that there was a possibility the individual may not be a psychopath but a genius instead, they never pursued that angle. It is not dissimilar to what, in reality, is known about psychopaths that there are thrill seekers who have that similar flatline emotional state but do not exhibit as murderers, they may be thrill seekers (extreme sports), highly competitive business or finance moguls, or other such adrenalizing pursuits. It was unclear if the Doctor was thought to have the psychopath gene, he was part of the experiment so you could assume he did, however it was not clear.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

There's a deeper and more meaningful message which makes the show all the more interesting and unique. Everything nicely unravels and explains as the episodes progresses.On another note the acting pedigree in Mouse is insane and it also comes with one of the most EPIC and memorable endings that I have ever seen in Kdrama history.Fair warning that its not for the faint hearted as there are a lot of tragedies to deal with which can be too depressing for some.Note : Watch 2 special episodes, ""Mouse the Predator"" after episode 15, before continuing on to the next episode.

The creators are hinting at season 2 with new characters with story line set after the events of first season in the last 30 seconds of the finale episode after end titles.Brace yourself, I believe that this is not the end.

Noo!!They were friends and he took pictures of his crimes WAHT!!!Is it smart to write a headache script?The script is like the draft script that got refused because it not consistent.And don't get me wrong I liked the suspense and the action but it could be a science fiction.

What I liked the most is that everything they show is linked with somethimg else.-> Every episode they gave us pieces of puzzle but till the end you can t be sure if you put the pieces in the right spot.-> Also even if some said that 20 eps are too many, the action is going fast and I didn t feel that they are dragging it.-> The acting was so on point.In conclusion for me Mouse is one of the best k drama with a solit script, more genres combined and a lot of twists plots like even if you have a theory and it s right they make you questioning it.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"An old lady, motivated by her daughter's problems at school, goes to look for a part-time job at an intermediary agency. The agency employee rudely rejects her and, for some completely incomprehensible reason, leaves the office, leaving the grandmother alone. Left alone, grandma promptly empties the fridge full of juices and stuffs them into a bag (for no particular reason other than so that Detective Ko can later connect the clerk's bag full of those juices with the grandmother's disappearance). During that time, the phone in the office rings and grandma answers it, because ... well, that's the most normal thing to do, obviously. What a coincidence, a cleaning lady is wanted in, wait for this ........... the house of main suspect. Grandma takes the opportunity and sends herself there. Finally at her destination, she relentlessly sets about cleaning, and in her almost insane enthusiasm and desire to clean every inch of the house, she stumbles upon a locked remote room. In the basement. Locked up. Unlit. In such a situation, who wouldn't unlock it and enter, I ask you?The grandmother discovers what she shouldn't and runs away. But not to the police, oh no, that would mean she couldn't be followed and killed and the scenario couldn't continue. She runs away to her house, located in the middle of dark and deserted alleys, because, well ... she's afraid. And we know that terrified old people always prefer to choose dark and deserted spaces :)And then she meets her sad fate, which sets a new ""plot"" line in motion.Come to think of it, the whole school bullying/settlement scene was crammed in there just so Grandma would have a motive to look for a part-time job. No school bullying was mentioned either before or after. Ever.Finally, not that any of that really matters though. It's just a smoke screen to deceive the viewer, since it will be shown later that this is not this and that is not that, explained by an equally ridiculous sequence of instant obstacles and resolutions.I kid you not.That's the level of writing in this tiresome soap opera.

The actor is not chosen behind the scenes in a way that shows the actor's feelings, and as a result, these films are lame in terms of staging. But this is not the case in the series Mouse. And all these issues have been addressed. Many of the serials are such that they do not need any analysis, but you had to analyze the serial ""Mouse"" in order to understand what the director intends to do with this scenario! The story maintains its coherence and it is clear why it is moving forward. There was an irrational issue that we realized in the two new episodes was not such a thing and it went quite logically.

Props for how everything came together; however, the director is also responsible for editing...Editing: not without glitches and occasionally bothersome. There were jump-cuts that should not have occurred. Music segues and scene transitions were occasionally jarring. Maybe the series was artlessly recycled from the movie. The director should have made the editor fix these things.Notes: The talented writers use of misdirection in Mouse kept me second-guessing until the 19th episode. Much was improbable; none of that was unexplained. And plenty of themes to discuss after viewing. A tangled skein that fully needed 16 of its 20 episodes so the writers could address all the times viewers hit the stone wall of improbable action.My hat is off to the script coordinators, who kept all the threads in sight and without loose ends.

Too many of these and things begin to fall flat and boring. Too many attempts at being unpredictable becomes predictable. I stopped trying to keep track of the twists and stopped trying to untangle them in my mind. That was the only way I managed to stay engaged till the end.Still, kudos to Lee Seung-gi for once again a stellar performance.

tt13634792,An interesting series which proposes people are born with the psychopathic gene and then looks at detectives played by Lee Seung-gi and Lee Hee-joon trying to track down and arrest them. The plot is very convoluted and complex which is made worse by the way flashbacks are used which I found confusing. All the actors did a sterling job especially the killers and if the storyline was more linear with fewer episodes I would have awarded more stars. Also parts of the plot need you to suspend belief totally (e.g. Brain transplants) which is such a shame as if they had kept it simpler it would have been much better.,neutral,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
tt13634792,"Ok I watched carefully until halfway through second episode then read the reviews to see if it was worth my time anymore because it was already so depressing and dark. The hype really had me fooled that this would be a good series. But then I saw the reviews (both good and bad) and could see two things that really bothered me so I stopped watching.1)The ENTIRE premise is that there is something called a psychopath gene and if you have it, then you have a 99% chance of becoming a psychopath (using all famous serial killers and evil dictators, like Hitler, as examples of psychopaths) and only a 1% have a chance of becoming a genius (they use famous composers and artists as examples).And then, with a serial killer on the loose (called the Headhunter) the government takes a vote on whether or not they should pass a forced abortion law for anyone whose unborn baby tests positive for the psychopath gene.I mean REALLY??? So they claim they've done all this science to be able to tell that everyone born with that gene will either be a genius or a murderer. And there's no other option. There are about seven billion people on the planet who may also have this ""psychopath gene"" but since they've never been tested how could we ever possibly KNOW THAT KIND OF THING??TALK ABOUT JUNK SCIENCE!What about all those billions of people who may have that gene that live perfectly normal lives because they were raised properly and we simply didn't know they ""had the gene""? Oh well we don't address that. I mean seriously. The premise is just EVIL that a baby is in anyway BORN EVIL.And ya gotta love how the President of Korea decides to vote against killing all the babies solely because he had just found out his wife was expecting their first child. But that was the only be reason he didn't murder all the other people's babies. And then his assistant, who's clearly upset with him says something like ""Ok, but I hope you can live with yourself when we could have gotten rid of all crime and murders and evil for your child's future but didn't!"" Yeah, that makes sense since his child might be aborted and would have HAD NO FUTURE! LOL!And as if only psychopaths murder or do horrible things?? I got news for this show's creator: we are ALL capable of doing bad... even horrible, things. Like what about drunk drivers? Do you drink? If there's any alcoholism in your family you could become an alcoholic too. That's been proven....whether it's nature or nurture we don't really know. But it's true. So you might kill someone in a drunken rage or by drinking and driving.Should you have been aborted??? No of course not.What about crimes of passion where someone, because of shock, just loses it temporarily and kills or nearly kills someone else? Did aborting all those unborn babies with the psycho gene stop that? Nope.It's called being ""fallen in a fallen world"" which is why we needed Jesus Christ to save us from our sins. You're not a Christian? Fine. But it's the truth. And no one can deny that if people actually lived the commandments that Jesus taught, then there would be far less crime. But that's the hard way, so let's just abort babies who haven't done anything wrong.Oh and btw, read about Pharaoh and Herod in the Bible. Both of them murdered hundreds of thousands of babies. What would have been the difference between those evil (psychopathic) men and the leaders of Korea if they had passed that law? Nothing.And while we're at it, why stop at unborn babies? Why not have every single man woman and child report for their psycho gene testing and kill everyone who has it?Oh NOW we've gone too far??Do ya see the problem with this entire premise yet??2) The other problem I had with this show was there literally was no one to root for. There was no good vs evil where good triumphs in the end.What's the point of that? Like the world isn't already so dark that we all need to be depressed after watching ""entertainment""?It's a hard pass for me.Btw on a side note it's really concerning to me how many people thought this was entertainment. *Sigh*As a suggestion, if you're at all thinking like me, maybe stick to other series like ""Flower of Evil"" or ""The Good Detective"" or ""It's Okay to Not be Okay"" or ""Beyond Evil"" or ""Glory"" or ""Vincenzo"" or ""Eve"" or ""Reborn Rich"" if you want good to win in the end.Anyway have a great day!",negative,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

tt13634792,"So as I mentioned in the title the lead actors did agreat job.. but the writing of this show couldnt be saved just by these talented actors..
The show portray people with anti-social disorders and psycopaths as violent indivduals with a sole porpose, murder. Its scientifically wrong. Personally I dont think aproaches like this to mental disorders and illness benefits anyone.A lot of people may argue that its a sci-fi based show, but still the hinting to real life disorders is very strong.And even if it wasnt... the ideas and solutions its suggesting are very weak. Like lets say they manage to eleminate the (psycopathy gene) which is a very radical way of handling stuff in the first place, but yeah even if they do so. It just doesnt solve the bigger problems like poverty, war and crimes that anyone is capable of doing it. So it just didnt make any sense to me.....The show is very intertaining though, if you ignore the ""scientific"" aspects to it. The actor Lee Seung-gi (Jeong Ba-reum) is extremley taleted there is no doubt in that. Also. Lee Hi Joon (Ko Moo-chi), Kwon Hwa-woon (Seong Yohan) very very talented.

there's always a card at play and it keeps us engaged till the ep ends.Also if you decide to watch it , good luck

Where i do feel the show took a nose dive was after Yo Han's death, the show after that just felt messy and felt like a chore to follow. A LOT of mistakes made that made me dislike episodes. It never truly picked up that spark it had in the beginning (although i still enjoyed it), once the plot twist of Ba Reum being the killer was fledged out more i really enjoyed what they done with his character but i can not see it as development because it is just Yo Han's brain doing all the work and without that brain Ba Reum would still be the same monster which makes it shocking that in the finale they make it out that he was a killer because of the gene and its not really his fault he is like this!!! Bong Yi's conclusion is awful, having flashbacks that Ba Reum is different is silly HE KILLED YOUR GRANDMA AND HAS ONLY CHANGED BECAUSE ITS JUST A DIFFERENT GUY'S BRAIN! Just messy, i didn't care for the knot murders (thought i'd add that). The show has some great pieces of dialogue and is shot AMAZINGLY but these parts where i had clear issues is where it hurts the rating from being great to just a borderline 7.",neutral,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
tt13634792,"The series is just too good. So much emotions that will keep you entangled throughout the series. Never expected such plot twist. And WOW! What an acting. I'm a fan of Lee Seungi now. He's done an incredible job. Cried so much in the last episode. He's done a commendable job especially in the last episode where I couldn't hold my tears back and finally forgave the character. All other actors also done a splendid job. It's a bit ruthless and one need to be empathetic and emotionally strong to go through this series. So I understand it's not for all may be because there are lot of blood and violence going on in this series. But if you can bear to face the ruthless real crime world and understand the sci-fi, then you'll be able to understand and handle this series. Scientifically many things that were shown as sci-fi are very accurate in this series. So, it's a 100% recommended series.",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Gets you hooked until the very end I binged it in a day! You're not sure what should you be feeling, pity for some characters while disgusted by few others. The plot so unexpected. Beileve me when I say you will question the main lead until very end. Also some part of the plot are not scientifically relevant but you know it's worth it.

tt13634792,"No the series is not dark, I blame the mum who assumed and saw him as a killer and she gave him up while adopting another's kid despite that kid having same gene. It's heartbreaking when he revealed to her that he had no intention of burying his brother back then. He was discriminated against right from the start by both mums, he was triggered and pushed into becoming a predator after seeking revenge for losing his adopted family. I've not seen a series with so much clever twists before. I can't predict who and what, because the plot twists were laid out very tightly to confuse me every step of way. Very well done.To me, the insightful part of this series is the play on a person who loses his memories, how he carve a new self image, borrowing from flashes and fragmented past memories and from what others describes him to be. The murderous part of him would possibly be hidden from him forever. Remembering the truth of his past sins and going into full remorse mode is only necessary in this sci-fictional and logical series. Makes you ponder deep on what makes a person, is it his genes, his memories, his past, his plight or his conscience. Eventual killing of his dad in prison gives necessary closure but also reminds us that the system is sending a repented former murderous self who is now gone.. to jail. The genuine struggle he displayed by killing his dad demonstrated that . It's philosophical and very deep. It's challenging and surfaces what might actually be wrong at every part of this series. It's not just about twists .",positive,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

The Koreans are producing some outstanding films and TV shows and The Glory is a shining example of this.This is the first Korean TV series my wife has seen and with the last episode still to play out, she is already a fan of them.The Glory achieves exactly what you want from a TV show like this... something you look forward to watching at the end of a busy day. It's so engaging that we have been watching 2 to 3 episodes each night, with almost no distraction from our mobile/cells phone.The story its self has several levels to it and goes deeper than what I was expecting... and where I would normally expect a twist (had it been an American series) The Glory show catches me off guard by playing out exactly as it should do.The sole reason for removing 1 star is it does feel a little drawn out at times, but oddly, it also works as at no time did I feel bored watching it.As a result The Glory comes Highly Recommended!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

First 30 minutes of 1st episode was really hard to watch, not because it's bad, but because it's so good potraying how brutal high school bullies can be.And forget Song Hye Kyo as a ""South Korean Melodrama Queen"". Here she's poignant and dark due to her character's constant bullying in high school. You'll only see her smile after 20 minutes into the 2nd episode and laugh after mid 5th episode. Yeah, that's how bleak The Glory is.And season finale, 8th episode was a cliffhanger. Season 2 will be aired on March 2023.

Love the the storytelling and Kyo's facial expressions and the atmosphere she exudes especially. The relationship between every characters are interesting to watch and won't feel dull, among which, the chemistry between DongEun and the maid I like the most, like a dim light in the dark night. Humanity warmth and thoughtfulness inadvertently and naturally reveal when DongEun and the maid meet.

tt21344706,"I won't add any spoilers, but what I will say is that there are very uncomfortable scenes with violence that I think caused some people to rate this drama lower than it should be. If you can push through it, trust me that it's well worth your time. I binge watched part one and part two as soon as they came out.The character plays a woman now in her mid-30s who wants to seek revenge on her bullies from when she was 18 or 19 years old. Those bullies who are part of a clique of mostly rich students, picked on less fortunate students with brutal results. They were simply allowed to continue doing this and their behavior was overlooked by teachers, the authorities and even the parents of those who were bullied. What I also find interesting as a side stories of the male lead, and the other women who were all bullied.I won't reveal more of the plot, because I think it's important for you to watch every single scene, don't miss anything. Rewatch it if you need to, all 16 episodes but open your mind, and see beyond violence.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Every single one of the cast members gave their utmost performance, making each episode feel intense and mind-blowing in the right balance. My respect for Kim Eun-sook, she didn't shy away from antagonizing the main characters because truly, you reap what you sow. The only thing I wish they'd done differently was to cast someone older for Joo Yeo-jung for a more balanced pairing with Song Hye-kyo, because let's be real; she had more solid chemistry with Jung Sung-il as Ha Do-yeong than with Lee Do-hyun.

Words just moves the plot, add sizzles to the emotions but no depth other than one offs. That's almost always the problem with this type of show. Revenge is revenge.

There's an underlying message as in all Korean tv/movies about how class rules society shown as how a young Dong Eun has no one to turn to because of her lowly standing and her perpetrators are giving free rein due to their parents wealth and standing in society.The tension build up and complexity of the characters makes you care what is going to happen something a lot of series forget to do these days.The acting is superb especially by Song Hye Kyo who plays Dong Eun,she manages to play her anger frustration and sadness brilliantly.But the real showstopper for me is the little girl who plays Ye Sol...she steals every scene she is in I could watch her all day!!!!!Well worth watching and cannot wait for march and part 2.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

I have more chemistry with a slice of pizza than the main antagonist with her dreams/motivations (her relationships with her husband and daughter).Main character is ok. Comes off as dead inside, no anger or sadness or joy. Just dead. Not great for a revenge story, but some moments are saved by her veteran acting skills.Main character's love interest is a 27yo, acting the role of a 35yo, but comes off as immature & shallow as an 18yo. He's a stereotypical teenage girl's crush: a doctor & a bad boy who gets into fights, empathetic & loved by his patients, from a good background & willing to kill for his love interest who doesn't reciprocate any kindness.

Now, I'm beginning to think the latter were either fake or from people with very low standards.This show has nothing but clichés and an unrealistic script to offer. It's slow and filled with useless scenes and dialogs. Really, it's your typical K-Drama, shallow but shiny.It does shine indeed but only in vanity. None of the characters have redeeming qualities. They're either murderers, would-be killers or violent criminals. All that, very casually!Quite surprisingly, the episodes are long but nothing meaningful ever really happens and the plot never seems to progress. So, my advice: do not waste your time!",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The best revenge is when the person ends up digging their own grave. Moon Dong Eun is literally a master of strategy and orchestrating a revenge that sees these monsters taking each other out. What makes this so satisfying is that she uses their own acts of violence and cover-ups against them. In short, this may be one of the best stories of revenge I've yet seen, in which the revenge actually does feel more like justice. Moon Dong Eun doesn't use acts of violence against them. She nudges. She prods. She pokes just enough to let them do the damage themselves. In some ways, the K-Drama ""My Name"" felt more like a revenge story than this one. That is not to say that ""The Glory"" is somehow inferior. It isn't at all. And because Moon Dong Eun is able to create justice-disguised as revenge-I didn't feel one shred of sympathy of those who ultimately caused and created their own downfall.This story takes bullying to an extreme level. Not necessarily one that is unbelievable. In today's world of bullying, it's sad that nothing seems to shock or surprise us anymore. The first half of the first episode is tough to watch as we see Dong Eun enduring horrendous torture as her nemesis, Yeon Jin, take great delight on burning her with a curling iron. It doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that Yeon Jin isn't a typical bully. She's a sadist, who is also very likely a psychopath. These days the terms ""psychopath"" and ""sociopath"" are now under the term ""Antisocial Personality Disorder."" Yeon Jin doesn't feel a shred of guilt or remorse for her actions. She smiles and even cackles with delight as she torments the girls at the school. Bullies rarely act alone, as Yeon Jin has five friends, including two boys, who also take pleasure in raping the girls. In short, these five people may be five of the most sadistic and diabolical bullies I've seen. Bullies are cowards, and it often takes someone of real strength and courage to fight back. By the time the first couple of episodes are over, you really can't wait to see what Dong Eun has planned.At first, Dong Eun's plans don't seem to be doing too much. But, ah! Just like the master tactician on a chessboard who moves his pawns to set up his other pieces, or in this series where the game of ""Go"" is used as means of illustrating Dong Eun's plans, we see that her plans are carefully thought out as she sets each one of the five perpetrators up. She's also like a master Judo or Akido fighter-using her opponent's momentum against them. In other words, she knows the weaknesses of each of the five and how to exploit them perfectly so that they end up actually fighting against each other. By the time the second season begins, you can't help but begin to marvel at Dong Eun and how she can weave such a complex tapestry to orchestrate a nearly flawless revenge!If Dong Eun has a blind spot, it has to do with her alcoholic mother. Just because you give birth to a child or make a child, doesn't make you a parent. Only a true parent raises their child properly with love and wisdom. And I found it a bit frustrating that Dong Eun gave in to her mother, yet again. But fortunately, she quickly realizes her mistake and rectifies it. No parent like that has any business being a part of their child's life. None.We quickly see how the rich and powerful believe that they are untouchable. Yeon Jin learns this at an early age from her own mother. And it's quite obvious that the parents of the other four were likely no different. Spoiling a child is also a form of abuse, but as I said, we don't feel sympathy for Yeon Jin and her sadistic cohorts! As each one of them falls, it's hard not to feel that sense of justice because that is exactly what it is. In some ways, the other four get off somewhat easily compared to Yeon Jin, but that's all right. Seeing Dong Eun speaking to Yeon Jin in prison was sheer perfection as Dong Eun gently smiles and outlines exactly how Yeon Jin trapped herself as well as the life she now has to look forward to. And the bully becomes the bullied as Yeon Jin now finds herself the target of her cellmates. Yes, justice is sweet!This series is definitely hardcore, compared to most K-dramas I've seen. It's dark, gritty, and it certainly doesn't pull any of its punches. The writer really illustrates the point that nobody gets away with anything. Ultimately, the truth will always come out and justice will be served.Performances in this series were all first-rate. I hadn't seen Hye Kyo Song since ""Descendants of the Sun."" I thought she did an incredible job of playing a character that was so different from the previous one. And I've been seeing Yeom Hye Ran in so many series lately! And that's good because she's an amazing and versatile character actress! She is fantastic at playing Dong Eun's sidekick and intelligence gatherer as follows the five around taking photos. I also loved how she played Yeon Jin-which was almost even more satisfying than what Dong Eun had cooked up! I was waiting for someone to smack Yeon Jin a couple of times!This series may not be for everyone, given its very dark theme, but frankly, it is a necessary one that doesn't try to dilute the effects of bullying. People have no idea how many children take that abuse into their adult lives-both physical and emotional. Isn't any wonder that Dong Eun has to take matters into her own hands when the judicial system, the parents, and the schools, fail to help protect them? It may have taken Dong Eun 18 years, but finally, justice is served!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"An 8 episode Korean revenge tale that anyone who has been bullied can relate to, The Glory is well done all around.I'm not sure how high schools compare Korea vs. America in terms of bullying, but as shown here, Korean teens seem super mean and cringeworthy. The main character, Dong-eun is picked on verbally, burnt with a curling iron by classmates, then slapped by school administrators. She drops out due to the abuse, then works menial jobs and studies to eventually go to university. All the while, she's plotting revenge on her high school tormentors.As far as I can tell, there isn't anything wrong with the technical aspects of this production, the script, dialogue, sets, editing are all great. By far the best aspect is the emotions The Glory May cause one to feel. As a poorer child, I wanted the rich, entitled girls to ""get theirs"".So well done.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"One should not watch this as a K-drama point of view, because this simply pass all K-drama standards and could be regarded as a high quality television series.If I go on to describe the characters, it may give out spoilers, so I am just going to say that every single cast member brought their A-game when giving life to these characters. Of course, the great actress Song Hyekyo stands tall amongst all of them for her micro expressive, cold and calculating character. But, even the little kid was really doing a great job and we felt raw emotions from all of them.Lee Dohyun got a bit sidetracked in the first few episodes, despite him being the male lead, but he is very prominent and integral during the second half. He was the heart and soul of the show where the energy is provided by Hyekyo. Their chemistry was very palpable as well. Overall doing a spectacular job as the cast.The director and writer must get along very well as the drama flowed very smoothly in a good pacing, without any fillers nor unnecessary characters. Even the camera angles and editing brought the highest of emotions to us. The dialogues were not over the top nor cringey and felt authentic.The drama ended in a highly satisfactory note as well with no lose ends and everything getting tied up really nicely and neatly that you as a watcher feel content after watching the drama.Highly recommended.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"""There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either."" - Moon Dong-eunThe Glory is a South Korean television-series written
and executive produced by Kim Eun-sook, who molds a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high school violence who carefully plots her revenge against those that have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides a masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun. Narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must share was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seamlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how you reap what you sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.The series' weakness lies within it's predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as 'Lady Vengeance' and the 'Kill Bill' duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days. I am looking forward to the release of Part 2 with the conclusion of this potently written drama.IG: thecinephilereviews.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

tt21344706,"So the series starts well, as well as revenge story can go. After the first episode you find yourself both excited for some deserved belated retribution and horrified at what you've just witnessed. The plan is in motion, even if it takes 18 years.We are following Dong-Eun as she climbs step by step towards her revenge and all is well. She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.I hope the second part will be better. It seems like they are capable of very dark things and I got the impression that's where we're headed. I just found myself dissappointed at how muddy the middle part got and I really hope the script will be sharp and crisp for the next part.

I think it is rare that a story actually delivers the justice that we as viewers want to see but here it is done so perfectly.

tt21344706,"Great intrigue, suspense and everything else that kept me at edge of my seat. Love the story's twisting and turning that just draws the viewer deeper and deeper into this dark story. The writing is brilliant - super plot - with tense turn after tense turn after tense turn. One has to pay attention, but unlike US made dramas, that is not riddled with politics and social messaging, this tale is all mystery...nicely done. The acting - yikes - too good for Hollywood. Each character is so well portrayed - the bad are really bad and the good - well - maybe not so bad. Directing and producing both nail this baby spot-on, making for a none-stop pot-boiler where juicy surprises just pop around every corner. Remember the adage, when this hand is moving, you better watch the other hand; in this show maybe watch the feet too. Please, stay away from Hollywierd, this kind of entertainment is something I will always watch. I don't go for whiny, preachy vomit, just really good stories like this one. Thank you so much for this work of art.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"This is one of my favorite korean drama.The story is excellent, characters are intense, the acting is terrific!My favorite actress is Yeom Hye-ran, that performs the poor abused wife. I'm not an expert but I think his acting is far the best in this TV show.Also other actors and actress are excellent, the main character, performed by Song Hye-Kyo, is so intense.I liked very much the plot, the character design and the photograph of the scenes.The run toward the riff of the evil bullies make you stick to the screen and you cannot leave.I'm not used to binge a tv show, but in this case you cannot skip.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Maybe because I had such high expectations?Revenge stories are not my fav, admitedly. But I still sort of liked ""Again My Life"" and ""Itaewon Class"" is my second favourite drama of all times.So... Let's begin with what I liked.The lady who was beaten by her husband. She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.Ye-Sol's father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.I also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.What I didn't like.The music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.The acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That's it. I couldn't even hate or resent them. They didn't feel like real people.SHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn't feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn't care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other's throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.I remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.On the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn't relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.Come to think about it, I wouldn' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In ""Encounter"" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I'm not so sure now. She was exactly the same in ""That Winter The WInd Blows"". Maybe better in ""The Full House?""At any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.Ah. If there is a third season. I won't watch. Not that there is anything to ruin. Just... Not interested.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The introduction was complete and good, so was the main part of the story. The ending could have been more but it was good as well. You have two people who have been through traumatic experiences and help each other while falling in love in the process. The whole revenge thing was so good and the lead actress scars and all still looked beautiful. I guess the moral of the story is be careful how you treat people because it can come back and bite you in a very bad way. I would definitely recommend this series as it keeps you hooked from the first episode to the last. The way she made them turned on each other was really wicked. A must watch series.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"There are a lot of great scenes and execution in this show. I loved that the show, for the most part, departed from the typical overly dramatic cheesy romance like many other dramas.That's where the show shines the most, when it's focused on the crime and suspense. The show starts off really well and pace really well past the midpoint where it becomes really sloppy.While I completely understand the motive of the lead woman, she's extremely boring, stone-faced, one-dimensional, and not very enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly all of the best moments are moments showing other characters. The dullest moments are those with her and her depressing obsessed doctor follower.Seriously? Even as cringy, annoying, whiny, and obsessed so many people are in most Korean dramas are, Joo Yeo-Jung takes the cake. His obsession and 'love' for Moon feels soo unnatural, out of place, and unwarranted it really waters down the rest of the show.I'd score the show two points higher if they removed him (or the weird awkward chemistry) from the main plot. He's like a real manifestation of plot armor for the main character in the form of a 'lover.'",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I mean the dialogue is awful with no depth at all. The acting is sometimes so childish, makes it really hard to watch it.Korean shows like to dramatise everything and in a really weird way.Every episode is so repetitive...we understand she got bullied in high school but the same scenes get constantly shown again. Some things just don't add up in this show. The rating people give is very surprising to me. Great concept but that's about it. This tv show would be better as a movie. Really don't understand the hype about. Don't waste your time on this show, there is so much better stuff out there.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Wow I binged this show in one day. The show starts with Moon Dong Eun getting horrifically bullied. I think I'm a little traumatized with see how bad they treated her. She ends up dropping out of school and getting a job with the intention of getting revenge on her enemies. Fast forward, she comes back and works as a teacher in the very same school she was bullied in and one of the kids is the daughter of Park Yeon Jin who was the leader of the group. The daughter is adorable and just pulls your heart strings. Moon Dong develops a plan and befriends Kang Hyeon-nam into helping her. Now Kang is a victim of domestic violence and part of the deal she made with Moon Dong is that she kill her husband. The entire series I was praying nothing happened to her because I love her character. All the actors in this show did a phenomenal job in portraying their characters. Now the hard part is waiting until March for part 2.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I loved the show, so spiritual, emotional, and definitely bingeworthy, I don't even watch kdrama but this had me hooked on the first episode knowing what the plot was. Especially since I can relate a bit. Being bullied is never fun but its never something you want to bring back up when you're already grown up and growing out of that ratchet life. I used to play Gomoku w my bestfriend and watching the show makes me want to go back to playing the game. It's really a mind game. The actors on this show btw will deff have you attached just saying. The relationship she grew w the grandma tht was helping her out was so cute the bond they grew together 😭😭😭",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I started watching with double feelings. Korean is far away from our culture and western habits bit...what an amazing history. I thought it was again a kind of vengeance and murders etc...but...incredible how this story was written. Good beginning. Ani was amazed by the ending. Very good actors, very good plot...not the kind we are used to. Every single contributor did what he had to do and made a huge success of it. Even the music is well composed. It is available on Spotify. Not easy to remember the names sometime. But not so difficult neither as the story is well build up. First time I looked for other Korean movies and series because I am surprisingly very fond of The Glory. Worth watching it.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"***SPOILERS***The best Kdrama I have ever seen! Not a straight ""I was bullied years ago and want to take revenge now in my adult year"", none of that easy and flat stuff.This Kdrama layers down so much that every second, scene and every interaction that is shown, is crucial and important. Miss one scene and you've missed a lot. Since I've watched this like four (!) times already, I've come to notice scenes which, because of the heaviness of the topic, I missed in my first sitting. That I thought, why are they showing this particular scene? That, once you connect the dots, you'll be blown away by the creativity of the writer and the director. That you'll be amazed and want to see more of how the story will unfold.A unique topic, since I've said, this is not just a basic and flat revenge; it's mastering the art of taking over the power back from the abusers, to be calculating, to just simply wait for when to strike. Even if it takes years. To actually step up and announce to the perpetrators that you will be back for them. That you realise that taking your own life is too easy. Why not make them suffer like they made you suffer? Wow!!!This drama also shows this twisted relationship the main character, Moon Dong-Eun, has with her main bully. She even writes the main bully letters as if she was confiding in a best friend, but this is far from a close friendship; she hates her bully to the core and narrates eerily how she feels, how bad she wants to destroy the whole group who has tortured her, molested her and made her teen life a living hell. The hell she still is in during her far adult world; a scarred body that reminds her daily what she has been through. The triggers that bring her back to the very moments she felt excruciating pain.Every step Moon Dong-Eun takes, is set back in a brilliant contrast with the game, Baduk/Go; slowly winning territory from your opponent and bringing them down, one by one. Layering a perfect trap to take sweet revenge.The main bully, in het adult years, is living a beautiful life with a handsome husband and cute daughter and in no way ever thinks of her victim Moon Dong-Eun ever again. Until she's confronted by her and she realises just how messed up the web is that Moon Dong-Eun has spun for her.Please, do watch this and do not be discouraged to watch when some reviews say that it's slow, dull and so on. Those reviewers do not understand that simply taking revenge is brainless and will be just another show. This is art and is shown that way. Appreciate the art to understand this master piece. I've read some comments here that are disappointed with this drama but then I assume they've watched it with only half their attention. Doing that will make every drama a disappointing experience for sure. So take your time to understand this master piece. Watch this drama attentively; the scenes since every part is important.Make no mistake, the bully scenes will break you, make you angry, especially since some of the scenes are based on true events (the burning on the skin). But you'll be blown away by the performances and the stark resemblance of the young actors and the adult actors. That the younger actors also portray their part perfectly.Obviously, some people simply do not like the main protagonist, played by Song Hye-Kyo. But even if you're not a fan of her acting, you must admit that she totally nailed this part. She's also been receiving raving reviews about her performance, and that from US Forbes Magazine to Asian media critics. Finally, Song Hye-Kyo shows the world that she's capable pulling off this difficult character with such ease and grace. And, very realistically. She basically gives acting lessons and this is only season one!Her performance is spot on! She oozes every emotion one can have when they've went through what her younger character went through. She exhausts herself every day, punishes herself to not laugh and have a good time, since she's afraid it will distract her from her revenge. She hates her body and her scars. The empty look in her eyes show that she's broken from the inside. I've never seen such emotion shown in reel.Fun fact; there's a scene in which she's showing her body and her scars to the male lead. This has lead to controversies, since some netizens don't like her body (the most stupid thing I've read; everyone is beautiful!!). This is simply ignorance, since the whole meaning of that particular scene is not to just simply show her body to anyone because she feels like it; she finally opens up to someone who she feels can be her swordsman. To do the actual execution for her, to actually kill for her. To convince him that her revenge is just, that she can't just simply forgive and forget while the whole world just stood there and did nothing (actual crimes she's experienced!). I think this is the most intimate and beautiful scene I've ever seen.Season one ended with a major cliffhanger and actually the body of her revenge all set; I believe season 2 will be the actual execution of her revenge plan.Can't wait to watch the second season.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I believe the way the first season has developed the main character until she gets her revenge is unimaginable and unique, although I stand up to the chance that she'll be alone in the end, while the rest probably will be either dead or in prison. Her love interest is also an incognito and probably will have lots of struggle until he gets better from his mental illness and get involved with Dong-Eun romantically, also, his father's killer is a huge problem for him to surpass his shocking fellings, especially during his letters. That's why I give a nine star for the first part, even though I don't know how the series will proceed after the opening final.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A forbearance and revenge spanning many years also reflects the contradictions between the capitalist class, campus violence and the ugliness of human nature. The rhythm of the whole play is well controlled. The script is silky, full of tension and excellent in appearance. Through the positive description of the countless violence suffered by the protagonist and the scenes of scarring his body many times across the time latitude, the anger and helplessness of the protagonist and the cruelty of the perpetrators are more forcefully highlighted, which brings greater shock to the audience, and also makes the audience more deeply aware of the seriousness of campus violence and the harm it brings to people. Metaphor is used in many places, which adds artistic color to the film.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I have enjoyed a handful of K Dramas over the years and Parasite is a favorite movie of mine. This particular drama misses the mark though, which is disappointing because the premise is fascinating. There is just wayyyy too much filler and unnecessary scenes. This could have easily been only 8 episodes and my opinion my have changed; however 16 was just far too many and there are episodes where you might feel like giving up on it entirely. If you're looking for a summer series out of boredom, give it a shot, but don't blame me for being bored and wanting to scream: OK, get on with it already!!",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,I thought I'll watch something Miley entertaining. I was sucked in after the first episode and could not stop watching until I saw every single one of them not going to bed till 5:00 in the morning. I was praying it will end and I'll be over in the 8th episode but then it was a cliffhanger and leaving me wanting to figure out what happened and I having to wait till March 2023!! I've never left a review for a TV series before but I had to cuz it was so good!!This series is definitely worse you watching you will not be disappointed. The acting was great the music is great the cinematography is awesome Suspense is good it was just overall super entertaining.,positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.I won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.If this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.However, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.But I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I really don't know what I keep missing here with Kdramas. I've seen 3 in total that I enjoyed, and this is not one of them. The whole premise is cathartic, a bullied girl getting revenge on her attackers. But the same issues I've encountered with other Kdramas hold here: firstly, WAYY too drawn out. 16 1 hour episodes is wayyy too excessive for something that could have been told as a two-hour movie. The main antagonist girl is a ridiculous overactor (she'd be at home in Jdramas) and the main character tells sooooo many people about her revenge plot it just becomes absurd. I mean it's not the worst Kdrama I have seen but it is still meh, I wouldn't recommend it.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A perfect example for a great pace & detailing one need to watch and learn cinema medium,mark my words screenplay will be or reason that every successful flick had enjoyed success and Koreans have mastered this art effortlessly.....
Not to mention particularly overall casting did a fine stellar performance in elevating this kdrama to a new line of cinema....
Definitely thought provoking with a simple word ""BULLYIN"" and developing a plot with intense series of raw emotions & flawless screenplay is adorable...
The best part is that all the confrontation scenes in every episodes sends a spine chilling moments that tests our patience to wait for season 2
Overall a must watch series.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,Highly recommend. Can't wait to watch season 2. Song hye kyo and lee do huyn are the reason I'm watching this movie. But after I watched it the movie attracted me every minuets. They have so many plot twists that made me can't stop watch it. People said the movie reborn rich is the best movie but to me this movie is way better. The reborn rich I have to drop it after first episode but this movie I finish it in a day. I'm not type of revenge movie but i watch it second time while waiting for next season. Watch it you won't regret it for sure. Hope they have more season then just two. After all highly recommended.,positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The Glory exceeded expectations! This is one of the rare kdramas that managed to start off with a strong captivating story and held that pacing to the very end. There was zero wasted scenes nor any dull/draggy moments.The acting in this drama was top notch! Soon Hy-kyo was solid in her performance of someone with hidden pain (physically and mentally). Lim Ji-yeon, Cha Joo-Young were so perfect in capturing the very duality of two-faced characters. At times I couldn't even hate Lim Ji-Yeon's character because of the depth she went to to capture the evilness of the character. Yeon Hye-ran was probably my favorite as Mrs. Kang as she manages to put some humor into an otherwise very painful story arc. When she was eating in the car and laughing at a news forum, that was such a pure moment for that character.The pacing is fantastic. Never once did it let up on its suspense and mystery. It kept hold of it's suspense through a well executed plot that uses each scene to present a piece of the puzzle and wastes no time in long drawn out expositions.Also the cinematography, camera angles and editing are worth noting. The scenes are cut in such a way that it uses a theme to lead into one another using a very artistic flare. IE a candy wrapper, that we believe to be from Mrs. Kang's bag, floating across a parking lot to the feet of another character but at a different moment than we expected. Many small elements like that sprinkled throughout the show to give you subtle hints using cuts, props, set dec pieces .Overall THUMBS UP! Do check it out!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Strong first half but weak second half.Loved the concept and how the series started.Typical revenge story where the main lead swears vengeance to her school bullies and supposedly prepares for decades for the perfect moment to attack.While the premise is very electrifying and filled with very strong and emotional scenes, I was kinda disappointed with how the events where unpacking. Somehow I was expecting a more intelligent, cold and calculated plan. I was hoping for that explosive element of surprise but never came.Dont get me wrong, still a very well written script, there were no holes and the execution was impeccable. I just have seen better revenge dramas.But still amazing thrilling and powerful series to watch. Loved how it's bending traditional morality and values and Enjoyed very much how the compassion many dramas force into good traditional characters wasn't implemented here. I strongly believe bad people don't deserve forgiveness and I was thrilled to watch the lead's punishing every single one of those devils.I did enjoy the romance between the leads ( although this is not a focus key in the story) , who became accomplices fighting for a justice that nit always has to come from a legal perspective but more from a peace of mind emotionally speaking.I read a lot about these incidents happening in schools and It breaks my heart watching some of the scenes recreating all the tortures and bullying ( to the point I had to put my tv in mute) but it's necessary we see them so we can try and change the wicked society we live in.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I had no idea what to expect and was totally blown away, the first episode is a really tough watch due it's brutal bullying scenes, however this sets up the eseries perfectly allowing for multiple characters to really play their roles in the series.Overall a delightful piece of story telling that keeps you gripped till the very last scene. Well crafted characters that are developed throughout the series, unravelling back stories and twists that kept me thinking what's about to happen next.Is very rare to find a gem of a series this good, Koreans proving again they do revenge drama better than anyone..",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

There isn't a single thing that lets it down.The acting is exceptional, a really brilliant cast, without any weak characters. The story is truly engaging, brilliant, and the storytelling is impeccable. The cinematography is beautiful. The directing is a masterclass. The wardrobes and sets are gorgeous. The use of light and dark to tell the story, it's so clever. The editing is amazing, just infallible production.There is no filler, no drawn out episodes that go nowhere, there isn't a single moment of wasted time in the series. This is such a joy to have these days. It's almost annoying that it is so watchable as I wish I could have savoured it for longer.I'd love to see a second series of this, but at the same time, it wouldn't be a shame to leave it where it was left, in its perfect state.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Assault is a crime no matter the age or the perpetrators' roles whether directly attacking, or making the attacks possible. Rather than the numerous drama series showing the criminals attacking other students always with impunity, expose physical and verbal assault in the school system for what it is: a crime punishable by expulsion and imprisonment.For the victim to become obsessed and as vicious as the criminals-while understandable-makes her no better. I am still waiting for a brilliant writer like this one to stop the histrionics and go after the criminals and their supporters carefully and methodically and legally until they are expelled and imprisoned. Because it never should have gone as far as it was allowed. And it won't stop until it is exposed and punished in the courts. That said, everyone in this drama is excellent. Think how much more they could have been in a true revenge story resolved through the courts.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

IntriguingThis was a random select for me and i ended up binge watching it. I'm not finished yet, and just got started with the new episodes that came out on March.I like how korean films have manage to incorporate anime like emotes, body language, and scene expressions in live action. It makes Korean films so unique and so brilliant in immersing you into the emotions and this series does so well in how each character and scene express the atmosphere of the circumstances and situations that are around them.I am required to fill this all up but i have no other way to just say how great of a series this is to binge.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"This is a ""revenge"" movie, and be forewarned, revenge is not terribly satisfying. A poor second to forget and move on.The overall mood is somber, and some pretty gruesome stuff takes place. The main character was abused (really awfully) as a minor, and becomes highly focused upon retribution once she becomes an adult. She is adroit, a careful planner, and basically sets the predators up to trip over their own vicious natures and their proclivity to turn adversity into aggression including upon each other.The story is not told in a linear fashion. Stuff happens, Then some backstory that proves illuminating and often surprising. And then again, and then again. It is engaging to never be completely sure you've got the full picture, and see your ideas of events get switched about.If you are in the mood for a bit of puzzlement and ready for a grim take upon life, this series will work for you. It moves along, and has interesting performances. It will leave you feeling that although there are good people in the world, you had better be ready for bad apples, and they are found in all walks of life.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Trails off and dulls!!! My goodness this show became annoying. At first I was rooting for the main character but as the show went on she became highly unlikeable. Note to Netflix: viewers like characters who still have some humanity left in them. Who can feel, laugh empathize smile and show emotions. Although the main character was bullied and I can understand why she would become hard later in life, by gosh she was so stiff and straight it became annoying. I haven't even finished yet and not sure if I will but please if writers can correct this, it will keep viewers coming back. Also I refuse to believe that grown adults still behave so grotesquely ALL THE TIME everyday towards one another. 5 stars for starting off good and then becoming annoying.",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Great drama. Like we get so much emotionally connected that we tend to feel the pain and get that what the victim is suffering.It is also a good love story which is so rreaall. Many of the reviews here are about first 8 episodes because they released first 8 at once and took almost more than a month to release the other 8, almost like another season but were released under the same.First 8 episodes went like it was just 1 episode.So smooth and interesting series.Story is all about the revenge of botb the leads..but obviously only 2/16 for male, rest for the female.Executed very well, was great and got it when I lost interest in kdramas because of their constant and dumb storylines of some series I have gone through before The Glory.Go for it.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Like I know it's coming and super happy season 2 will be out in a few months because I got SOOO invested in this story I was ready! I guess though making us wait really does add to the slow burn that this show is all about. I mean 18 years she was planning so should've known this wouldn't go quickly. I think the acting is good! I mean sure revenge is a story we've all heard about before but I always like when they get creative. I feel like the next episodes will be just that. I also have no doubt we'll get to see everyone get just what's coming to them, along with answers to some burning questions! Easy to watch. Don't have many complaints. Keeping their names straight was the hardest part for me haha. Because sometimes they use all 3 and sometimes just 2, I just pulled up the cast on here and looked at the face if I got confused...so thank's for that IMDb.Part 2 did not disappoint! We got to see all the revenge plans come to fruition. Kept me guessing and had several surprises. Ended so well because it could absolutely be completely over and filling in the blanks wound be easy. I would love a 3rd edition so we can see how well the next reveng plays plays out though. I have no doubt there'd be many twists and turns along the way. I think this show is smart and well played.

tt21344706,"Usually in revenge stories where the victim lays out an elaborate plan to exact revenge years later, the protagonist would hide his/her true identity and motivation until the climax of the story when he/she is ready to strike the final, lethal blow on his/her perpetrators. In this case, despite being poor and powerless, our heroine has the guts to confront and taunt them face-to-face, ""your time is up"", with a deadly cool smile that sends shivers down their spine. If this is not class, I don't know what is.This is modern Korean thriller at it's best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters. A much more efficient approach certainly but the drama would be over in one episode... Here we get to watch each move our heroine makes like the Go master she is evolving into, making small wins one after another. But will she ultimately prevail? And if so at what cost? Will she be able to heal her scars one day? Can't wait till part 2!",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"It's well worth your time. Everything here has been made thoughtfuly and thoroughly: scene, costumes, music, pacing, framing and especially acting. Everyone here is doing what they are supposed to be doing and everyone hits it and get the intended reaction. This goes double for flashback scenes: those kids are really amazing. Awful, but amazing. I cannot wait for season 2 and I oftehn think of this show.But it has a huge flaw:
Season 1 is not complete. There is no wrap-up of the story, not only that not all questions are answered, but there is at least one major plotline being introduced. And that is done in a way that it may suggest there will be more than 2 seasons. This may not be all that bad, but streaming spoiled me, I'd rather binge than wait for months or years for continuing one story.Also, in past few months I also liked and enjoyed two other shows (Yellowjackets, From) whose stories are just cut in half and we need to wait for next season.This is a trend, but I really don't like it.The Glory?

Shocking events at the end of the first season, shocking amazing actors. The times that are full of fun, excitement, and enthusiasm pass quickly. This is how I felt when I finished watching the first season. I really didn't feel the passage of time in each episode. You were drawn to the next episode, and I also felt that this series provided a great opportunity to show the talents of the actors more, especially the actor Jong Song Il. I think it is time for him to take on an absolute starring role in an upcoming drama. I removed a star from my restriction because of the scandalous and bold scenes. Which, in my opinion, will not detract from the value of the work if it does not exist in the first place. Also, the OST of the series is really beautiful.

I would have gladly destroyed this group of people that are only doing this because they can and have backup from other friends. Cowards, find it disgusting how the school system looks the other way. This series is a prime example that changes in the school system, at home and with law enforcement are necessary. Shaming and expulsion, fines and no chance at a future at this school, are needed.

We found ourselves at many times aghast and cheering Dong-eon on as her well crafted plans play out.Another stand out performance was that of Yeom Hye-ran as Kang Hyun-nam.

Keep the entertaining stuff, and chop out the boring.Also, it becomes wishy washy with showing adult content. One minute they will blur it out, then the next you get full frontals. Yet they don't care to shy away from the violence. Why not just do it how ""High Society (2018), aka Sanglyusahoe"" did it?Which it can get super dark and depressing.

tt21344706,"This may be a subversion of the typical revenge thriller, but it feels a bit derivative since ""Promising Young Woman"" already did that. It's still very different, but it still feels trite. Not to mention, it can tonally lean a bit hokey and over-the-top, which I'd be all for if it were intentional.Most of it has to do with the fact that every character feels like a caricature. The bullies especially lack any dimension or complexity, but it's an even bigger sin that so does the main character, Dong-eun. Yes, her coldness is forged from trauma, but she's so one-note about it that those moments of levity with her love interest or the abused mother character don't land.So far I'm 10 episodes in and I'm finding it rather difficult to slog through the rest. I'm sure the writer found some elaborately clever, if not reaching way for Dong-eun to exact her revenge. I'll give it 5 stars for now, and if I care to finish, I'll add or take away a star depending on its ending, but I will not be recommending this to anyone...EDIT: just watched a recap and

There is a lot of time spent on building up the main character's backstory so the actual show doesn't gain traction until about episode 4. Unfortunately, this is where the plot runs into a bit of confusion with multiple characters, intersecting plots, and although the main character narrates some scenes, as a viewer I had to rely on plot summaries to explain everything else in scenes she wasn't in. Even with English subtitles, I still had to rewind to properly catch reactions to certain scenes.

Young actors are way too good, and I think they're one of the big reasons this show is great.I was shocked when I read that this is a real story and the real person committed suicide.I've been watching men's revenge movies my whole life, and women's revenge is way better than men's revenge. The story has a lot of small details that make it powerful and interesting.The young evil actress Shin Ye-Eun is extremely talented, charismatic and good to the point that I wish she acted in both roles. Song Hye-Kyo was average in that role and no chemistry between her and Lee Do-Hyun.Yum Hye-Ran was excellent and her story was very emotional.The end of the revenge was a bit too easy and boring. And we didn't need to see another revenge in the end, that was unnecessary.The First 8 episodes are great and exciting.The last 8 A waste of time.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"After watching the whole series, my impression is somewhat better than after the first eight episodes. Also, it is clear that although there are many inconsistencies in the story, especially in the police investigation, the whole plot should be seen primarily on a symbolic and metaphorical level. The relationships between the characters are well developed, and it is especially impressive to see how the characters themselves change as the story progresses and find themselves in new situations. This is especially true for Ha Do-Young.The ending is a little melodramatic, but it fits well since the whole story is quite painful. Also, there is too much mixing of plot from different time periods which just makes it harder to follow.All in all, a good series that is certainly not for those who want to watch something along the way for fun, but it is a good display of different characters with a special emphasis on evil people (that's the majority) who are irreparable until the end. No one had the slightest remorse for what they had done, but only felt sorry for themselves and looked to get out of their own problems regardless of who they hurt.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge! (I cannot understand why she is doing something like that rather than living her life peacefully? )The awful script continues with main actress's plan. To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.Moreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.Last but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.I still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it.

No help, no one says anything, this is very exaggerated.

tt21344706,"9.5/10 is my rating. This is a 2022/2023 South Korean psychological thriller with revenge as a primary driver for the main character. There are 16, 47-72 minute episodes in two parts. The first part comprises the first eight episodes which is primarily where the revenge is set up. The last eight episodes center around enacting the revenge.First I provide a unique synopsis then I review.SynopsisThe entire story consists of multiple instances of true life bullying and revenge incidents. It is all based on true occurrences but not all of any one but rather elements of multiple true occurrences all melded into one. It is representational of the full range of bullying and provides an example of the most extreme cases. In this story, Moon Dong eun (Song Hye kyo) survived her school years most likely by dropping out of school at a critical moment to survive the bullies. Others that were targets of the same group of bullies were not so lucky. Her entire life after that is centered around earning enough money, and putting herself in the correct position to exact revenge on those that caused such suffering and misery. She bears the permanent physical and emotional scars of the actions of this bully group. She becomes a teacher and steers the situation so she is assigned as the homeroom teacher of the leader of the bullies', Park Yeon jin's (Lim Ji yeon), daughter. From that position, which puts her in close contact with her targets, she plays out her revenge. By fate or chance she meets Joo Yeo Jeong (Lee Do hyun) who falls in love with the troubled and mysterious Dong eun and offers to help her after seeing and learning the horrible things that were done to her. Kang Hyeon nam (Yeom Hye ran) is a housekeeper in the home of one of the subjects of Dong eun's interest. Heyeon nam catches Dong Eun collecting and going through the garbage for clues and strikes a deal for mutual benefit. Dong eun is at first unwilling to accept the true friendship and caring from others as she is so damaged from her past. But as she widens her circle of supporters to help in punishing those who were not punished by the adults at the time, she begins to heal emotionally. Karma is coming to those that bullied helpless and innocent victims in the form of Dong eun. Can she survive her own revenge?ReviewThis is hands down the best revenge show I have watched. For anyone that has been bullied or been in an environment where there are lots of bullies, this will definitely resonate. For me those parts were hard to watch because I am an empath to begin with but also because I was involved in a situation where I was minimally bullied where someone else was bullied so severely it drove them crazy and they wound up on drugs, out of their mind, and ran over a bunch of people on a sidewalk and they are now in prison. I did my best, when that was happening to protect that person but, as the show portrays, it is hard to effectively protect anyone when you are one of their targets. But that was not physical bullying like this show had where it was severe physical bullying with a psychological component.The acting in this is phenomenal by both those playing the bullies, the victims and just everyone. It does roughly follow where the first eight episodes (first half) sets the stage and tells about the past, and the final eight are focused on the revenge aspects. I delayed watching it because I wasn't sure how well I could take watching the severe bullying, as when something like that happens to you it is not something you ever fully forget or recover from, so I thought it might be too emotionally upsetting for me. But it is just mainly those first episodes and the way she gets her revenge is so satisfying.In sum, I highly recommend this for anyone that likes the revenge trope. I would rewatch it readily if it was on as there is a lot of depth to itSpoilersThe main detractors for me were some unnecessary things people did. I think what I liked the least was that the main bullies' spouse, who had been a very likable character nearly to the end, wound up murdering his wife's lover. The guy was a part of the bully group, and had done some horrible things, but that did not excuse him pushing him, now blind, off a building into a vat of cement. I did not want to see the little girl with her murderous mom, psychotic grandmother, nor her sociopath father and thought I would be glad to see her going with the father she grew up with, but he did that and I was like great she is still being raised by a murderer. I know they were alluding that he did it so the real dad would not continue to bother them, but that is no excuse to murder someone.The other senseless murder was when the girl that was the main bullies' assistant, finished off the injured, long haired, boy bully. It showed he had raped her and they all were obviously still bullying her, but murdering him by making that final blow took her from a sympathetic character to a person willing to murder someone when they were helpless. If he had been actively attacking her again I could have sympathized but it was not an act of self defense at that moment. It did not feel as good that the main bully went down framed with a murder she may not have committed. They were trying for an even deeper revenge, because of the irony that she is serving time for a murder one of her victims committed, but I thought there was plenty of opportunity for her to go down for the murder without turning the victim into a murderer. And it is based on true events, not a record of true events, so it isn't like that was the way it really happened.The other detractor, for me, was Do Hyun's suicide attempt at near the end. During the bullying, at her young age, it showed a suicide attempt and I think they were trying to show that suicide was always an option for her and now she accomplished her revenge why not? She herself should have known how much that would hurt Yeo jeong. I mean I would hope she would know how much that would hurt all of the friends she had, however reluctantly, developed. It is just such a selfish act I have a hard time sympathizing. And, if she had gone through with it, it would have reversed a lot of her revenge as her main bully would have used it as a way to vindicate some of her actions. Like see ""she was always like that."" I unfortunately know that is likely how that would play out as I spoke with the bully that drove the girl crazy and to prison and asked her about that incident and she pretty said ""I know isn't she crazy?"" It was apparent from the very gleeful way she said it, that she was pleased with the outcome and did not feel any personal responsibility for the end result. That bully group destroyed one life and was, in my opinion, partially responsible for the death and injury that person that was bullied caused.It would have been nice to have seen the main couple together longer than just the tail end of the last episode. Some say the romance element was completely unnecessary but I enjoyed the angel that two people with psychological scars can find healing in each other.I think they left it open for another season by showing the male and female lead enter the prison where it was apparent they planned to exact revenge against the person who murdered the male lead's father. And that wasn't a bad way to end it. It didn't wrap up that particular piece but that was okay because it wasn't what we were there for anyway. Streaming platforms like to keep the piggy banks open and often end things very unclear. In this case that one piece was not even completely unclear. We know enough about our main girl by now that we can be sure she will help him get his full revenge.#SongHyeKyo#TheGlory#LimJiYeon#LeeDoHyun.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Born on the wrong side of the tracks, high school girl Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo, Jung Ji-so) got brutally bullied by rich peers. Not just with the usual slapping, hair-pulling or public shaming, but with means that would leave lasting marks all over her body. After realizing that even the school administration not only could not help her, but would even join in the bullying, she dropped out. She worked menial jobs to get an education degree and save money towards a revenge plan.In the meantime, her bullies went on to lead comfortable lives - a famous weather forecaster of a broadcast station with a sweet daughter and a CEO husband, a golf course executive and his lackey, a famous artist, an airline stewardess and an awarded school administrator.The story is intense. The bullying is horrific, making me wonder whether Korean kids are really this mean, having watched similar bullying scenes in The Penthouse and other kdramas. However, I haven't gotten drawn into any character as much as I would have wanted to. And after watching a seemingly endless parade of revenge-centric dramas, I am getting bored with this plot device. I was actually surprised at how revenge-driven this is, making it rather archaic. Even Chinese dramas, known for revenge plots, are now depicting stories that advocate love, peace and forgiveness.With a protagonist that has so much hatred in her as to hatch such a revenge plan, I doubt she can really love anybody, thus, I find any ""love"" angle in this drama implausible.I am still giving this a decent rating as the revenge was done not only for the protagonist's sake but also to serve justice for the murder of another bullying victim, though it begs the question: did the protagonist use the other girl's death to avenge herself?",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,I watched it till mid of episode 7. Eventually I gave up the hopes of this series ever picking up the pace. It's so slow it's like watching the paint dry.

The guy who loves the lead actress is so stupid I can't even put in words.Episode 1 was really really good though. It gave me great expectations so I kept on pushing till episode 7.

It is also contrived in the way it resolves many situations.However, it is easy to forgive this when the acting is sooo strong (the main heroine and the main villain are amazing, but not only them) and the story manages to engage us so intensely, touching on essential societal issues (not only bullying and associated traumas but also social inequalities, corruption and relationships).Nevertheless, I still can't see how a second season won't be a case of diminishing returns.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

I mean, you can just leave and move away. Report to the authorities and move on with life. Too much young and even older lives are wasted, whether you are famous or not. (It's a society that puts too much effort on respect, you have to be careful with your speech and actions when you visit their territory- or it's all just a facade!)But having watched The Glory (I can't believed i finished it in one day!), i saw and felt the victims anguished and how it tormented her for life. As much as I wanted to see her change and forget and have a life, I also wanted to see the perpetrators be punished- severely. It evokes emotions I thought I didn't have for such genre. The bullying scenes were necessary for skeptics like me to understand the depth of their agony.That's when I realized the actors, the storyline and the cinematography were so so so good. It's brilliant. Now I understand why Song Hye Kyo was chosen, she brought the character to life and she has done well. Her sneers and retorts make me cheer silently - hoping somehow it comforted the character although she will show she's in pain yet determined. She cunningly (yet also genuinely) made me fall for the character. The other characters were skillfully played that I just got invested with their next actions.Now, I can't wait for season 2.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I like the plot so far , theres a lot of backstory and also sometimes too many stories so I'm curious on how they will tie all this in.Firstly Kang Hyun really does have a significant role other then reporting to Dong Eun and waiting for her husband to die, so sometimes her screen time is predictable everytime she shows up.For instance Yeo Jung the doctor , I'm not sure what his story has to do with Dong Eun's other then being her headsman, but I'm sure he will be be the one in prison or doing the killing since he has a past trauma as well. They also show his father in jail , his father inmate number is his passcode to his house ; so I will pay attention to him In season 2.Other then all enjoy the show can't wait for season 2!",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Not only does the dubbing make the characters sound like a bunch of bratty valley girls in California, the lack of subs eliminates a lot of important cues from memos, tv shots, signage and so on. I'm still watching so not rating it just yet. It's no 10 but I'm enjoying it enough even with so much of the cultural info erased by this flub of a dubbing job.I've had some pretty brutalized students but no bully victims like Moon Dong-Eun. It's a bit inconceivable that injuries as extensive as those portrayed in The Glory wouldn't attract an intervention. Also, I used to teach at a national university training students on track to become secondary school teachers. The portrayal of the ease with which Moon Dong-Eun attains her teachers' certificate is facile in the extreme. It's bloody difficult to pass the test.",,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I very much enjoyed this surprising series... I knew nothing of it, or heard anything of it. I wanted to binge my way through it, and look forward to the next season that is coming in March this year. Its very dark at times.... and hard to watch the moments when the bullying is taking place in the high school, but shows you just how spiteful kids can be and can get into the minds of venerable humans who have little or no self esteem. Sadly, whats worse (spoiler alert) when you see adults behaving the same way, its even harder to watch but again, just makes it so hard to turn away. The lives of the wealthy are also exposed for the greed and though I found it hard to follow at times, it was worth the effort.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"I have watched a few revenge shows and this one is definitely one of the best ones. It's gory, suspenseful and entertaining. The Glory follows a group of people who went to high school together and their complex relationships later in life. We see many flashbacks to their life in high school, mostly bullying scenes that are heartbreaking to watch, but executed really well. The acting in this series is overall really great, especially from the bullies, there's just something so raw and almost eerie in their delivery.The complex characters and their complex relationships are very interesting to follow. This series does a great job at making you feel momentary sympathy for certain characters, only to make you question that seconds later.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"A revenge drama can be hard to watch. Especially if you allow the fact that revenge is a poor basis for justice to interfere with your going with the flow of the drama. This series largely avoids that problem through the nasties being agents of their own downfall. The victim seeking revenge does not kill or maim her targets. She manipulates them into doing that to each other.That is possible because the nasties are such awful people. Of course anyone who bullies to the extent they bullied the victim at school is likely to grow up to be an awful nasty, so I had no issue with that. More problematic for me was that they would continue as ""friends"" into adult life despite being so horrible to each other. Their constant abuse of each other was fertile ground on which the victim could sow sufficient discord for their group to implode.I also felt that one or two of the revenge outcomes were a little too easy - for example the death of the abusive teacher required little effort from the victim.The darkness of the storyline was partly redeemed by a love story - this is a kdrama after all! Gaining revenge did not give the victim her life back. She needed love to do that. If only she could have done it with the love but without the revenge.",neutral,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"Seeing all the promising reviews on IMDB and also since I was in the mood for a revenge thriller, decided to give this series a shot. The first episode was pretty gruesome and sadistic and it really set up the premise of revenge really well. But, the next 7 episodes after was just downhill. Introducing characters after characters, random plot lines and confusing scene edits and cuts. I was so angry that I invested so much time into this, that I tried to finish it, but stoped at episode 7, cos I couldn't take it anymore. The revenge plot is so slow and never picks up any pace. It's like watching paint dry. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS SERIES. It's a massive time sink with no pay off. Also, the young characters in the first episode were so good and then the odler characters, especially the main lead was so horrible from there on. So frustrated!!!",negative,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"
tt21344706,"The Glory is a 16-part Korean drama that we finished watching last week. The episodes run for between 47 and 60 minutes. The final episode is 71 minutes. It is the story of Moon Dong-eun, a woman who was brutally bullied by four rich girls in high school. The first episode is difficult to watch. Eighteen years later Dong-eun sets her plan for revenge in motion.Sometimes Netflix has a habit of stretching these shows into more episodes than are necessary to tell the story. That's not the case here. Moon Dong-eun's revenge plan has many moving parts, there is a lot of story to tell and many important characters to flesh out. A few episodes dragged a little, but most of them just zipped along.We watched The Glory with English dubbing and with the subtitles turned on. They were always in sync. People who know about these things have said that the translation was excellent.The trailers won't tell you much. The modern day portion of the story itself moves along more or less in a linear way but there are many flashbacks. Some scenes, especially in the final episode are shown out of sequence. I think it works. Some people have complained about how the girls were played by different actors in the high school scenes. At first it is difficult to keep track of the Korean names.The Glory is a dark drama with violence, an otherworldly amount of profanity and precious little comedic relief. In the final episode, near the 7-minute point, when Dong-eun says to one of her former tormenters, ""my schedule has opened up"", the viewer might feel like taking a really deep breath and letting it out.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

Totally believable story of a high schooler who was targeted for bullying (the bullies chose their targets, one after another) and ended up on the brink of suicide. The redemption of this story is unlike any other I have seen, it's totally believable, no plot holes, and the way the story moves is special. The actors are all worthy of their parts, and I got emotionally connected to the two leads exacting revenge. The revenge plot is well constructed, expertly thought out, and the finale is quite satisfying! The way that Dong-eun uses all her bullies to turn against themselves was brilliant and even better was the way she got Yeon-jin's mother to turn against her daughter.

The main character was so good. The suspense, the lightning, the sounds.. I like it so much.I was waiting so much for the revenge part and It was GOOD. Finally. Yes, FINALLY they got what they DESERVED, one by one. So satisfying✨
Especially when her mom tried to guilt trip her!Tbh I was kinda scared that the main character would end badly after all the work she have done, like ""my job is done, lemme end my life here"" but thank goodness the doctor was by her side.For me, everything was good.

There are at least one or two huge moments per episode a la breaking bad, and I was absolutely locked in for every minute of it. I watched the last 5 episodes in one day because I just couldn't bring myself to put the show down. The pacing is immaculate and every single actor is putting on the performance of a lifetime.

So many moments of fist clenching, teeth grinding, anger fuming, tears rolling throughout the series. This series depicted the norm of the world especially the vast contrast of those who have wealth and power versus those in poverty and marginalized and even in both, there are bound to be light and darkness that seemingly have their own way of justice and i can just say that i am soooo satisfied with the justice that have taken place in this series, well, at least in my head.Wished there was an end beyond the ending towards the end but anyhow it has to end cause the plot was such that it has to come to end even when i don't want it to come to an end.",positive,"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"

tt30368332,"Lee Jung-eun is indisputably the highlight of this show! She masterfully (and adorably) portrays a lady in her 50s acting like she's in her 20s. (She is known to international audiences for her roles in Bong Joon-ho's works like Parasite and Okja, which showcase the physicality in her acting. She boasts a prolific filmography and is wellknown to K-Drama fans for her supporting roles in Mr. Sunshine and When the Camellia Blooms.)The show is a slice-of-life drama surrounding a prosecutor's office but, at its heart, is a slapstick comedy with a blend of romance and mystery. It explores themes of ageism, government bureaucracy, substance abuse, and social expectations.The show shines with its lighthearted and humorous moments, but it features a darker storyline, the murder mystery, that has become quite common in K-drama comedies (e.g. Behind Your Touch). So, it's a whimsical blend of dichotomies and contrasts.I couldn't help but be reminded of Kafka's Metamorphosis when considering the central premise of this show. The physical transformation provides an amusing but thoughtful commentary on ageism.Don't watch this for realism.

In the process, she gets scammed and bumps into Prosecutor Gyu, who is harboring a dark secret in his sleeve.ReviewWhat is the benefit of working so hard?This is the question Mi-Jin asks herself when she fails the civil service examination again. In her last ten years, she did nothing other than study for it. But all she got in return was to hear that she is in her thirties now, without any experience, so getting a job is difficult. Her best friend Chon Hui is her only confidante. Her never-ending plight takes an unprecedented turn when she finds herself in the body of a fifty-year-old woman every morning and only returns to her true self at night. In between a serial killer is on the loose.Helmed by Strong Girl Bong Soon director Lee Hyung Min, the story is a perfect blend of romantic comedy with a big dose of horror. Mi Jin is strong and has an effervescent attitude. Even in the darkest hour of her life, she chose to live. This is where director Lee plays his cards. He never makes the story monotonous and cold. In the process of looking for the serial killer, Prosecutor Gyu and Mi Jin form a bond and even find solace in each other. The journey of love is not cliche but resonates with the life of this genre. The mother of Mi Jin resembles Bong Soon- she wants to see her daughter settled and is unaware of her true condition. They are sweet but self-centric. A supportive yet spineless father and an unannounced second lead in the form of idol Jo Won make the tale intricate and intriguing.Reply 1997 girl Eun Ji is brilliant as the night girl Mi Jin. Her banter with her friend, feeling attracted to the charming prosecutor - the girl brings out all effortlessly as always. Lee Jin Eun as fifty-year-old Lim Sun- the alternate identity of Mi Jin is the twist of the tale. The woman who mostly dons the character of a helpless mother has brought out the invisible kitty from her bag. Her enactment of the twenty-eight-year-old in body of fifty is hilarious and melancholic. Jin Hyuk as prosecutor Gye is remarkable. The man is one of the versatile actors in the Korean drama case. He knows what he is doing. He is effortlessly hot and equally cold - which is needed for this dark role. The supporting cast adds humor mostly, but Byung Hee Ajushhi is the cherry on top.ConclusionKorean drama directors always do brilliant in bringing out supernatural stories. This Miss Day and Night is no different again. A fantasy element packed in delving into solving a cold crime case is not just magnificent but more than that.",neutral,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"

But it's not meant to be serious which gets more and more obvious.Her parents remind me somehow to the couple in Kung Fu Hustle. It's a very weird and funny couple and well played.

It was interesting at first, but then it turned into a cliché mess. The main character became annoying and made dumb decisions, making the story cringey and overly dramatic. The final straw for me was the ridiculous umbrella and egg scene, and I had to stop watching right there.

The scene at the used bookshop are so staged it is wasting viewers' time, as if it is create there to stretch the time.The supporting characters are all useless characters, didnt contribute anything to the story.

Ummm.",negative,"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"
tt30368332,"This is another drama where the female lead is an idiot. I've watched 7 episodes and she may have put together three coherent sentences. Tops! She mumbles and looks at the ground like a five-year old. I know with cultural differences this is more normal in Korea. But, she's coming off practically mentally challenged. There is zero reason for the romance if he's supposedly an intelligent prosecutor. Even if opposites attract, I can't imagine he's going to find love with a total mumbling fool. However, the older female lead is doing a great job so far! I wish she'd be the overall lead and he falls in love with her. At least the character comes off as a capable human being during her time. I don't really know what else to add. If you are bored and want to watch something silly and don't care that the lead is feeble minded, you can enjoy it. The side characters, mostly her parents don't help much as all they typically do is try to marry her off. His partner is really funny. I have seen him act in other dramas and he's usually good.

The main and supporting characters are endearing, there's a lot of comedy, the sets and filming are eye candy, there are healthy ideas about withholding judgment and second chances and having the courage to live the life you want, the female lead feels real and genuine like she could be any of us, and the male lead's voice and facial expressions just draw you in and keep you hooked. The ensemble works well together and has a positive energy that reminds me of the ensemble in CLOY. There are a lot of commonalities actually, so if you liked the interactions between the characters there, you will probably like them here too. Kudos to the directors of My Sweet Mobster for bringing all of that out from the cast.There are a couple of details that I didn't care for (the kitty villain's character is very off to me, and I didn't like that the female lead actually accepted to clean her colleague's home and especially didn't like the low-self-esteem, ingratiating way she conducted herself in that scene; I could have swallowed it if she had handled herself differently or had cleaned anyone else's home like a normal job instead of allowing herself to be used like that by someone with ungenerous intentions). But overall, this drama has been a very enjoyable watch and keeps us looking forward with much anticipation to each new episode. Yes, it contains lots of tropes and silliness, but in a good way that is entertaining. This drama is addictive and sweet like candy and will give you the same little boost that candy does.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Chaos starts as the lives of these three different people from different worlds meet.ReviewDirected by Kim Hwang Yoon, this soft romantic story goes through the lives of people who have faced criminal charges before. Ji Hwan used to be a thug and has been in the money extortion business. His connection with Prosecutor Yeong shares insight into the dark past Ji Hwan has been fighting to move ahead. This conflict between good and bad stirs the tale ahead. Eun Ha's hard work and achievement this afr melt away at one single mistake. Another content creator Ye Na comes into action which is a blend of positive and negative light.The biggest thumbs-up for the drama is that it is very much today's story. Eun Ha's journey reflects the turmoil of every content creator who is making money in this business. Han Sun Hwa as Eun Hwa is warm and vivacious. She is trying to understand the human Ji Hwan is and the life he has been into. The romanticism identified in this character is discreet which matches up with the graph of the story. Tae Goo, the man seen in critically acclaimed films has been debuting as lead for the first time. He is soft in heart and is a clumsy person who is trying to fit in the polished world. The Goo rubs off sweetness ever since his appearance in the tale. He is someone with a golden heart and the door of his house is open for all. The way the director distinguished between the two worlds adds subtle nuances to the tale, like thugs calling Ji Hwan Hyungnim instead of Hyung. The altercation between two universes is satisfying and humorous.ConclusionThe overall story is heartwarming and light. While dueling in the past, the story goes through a laugh and love lane as two charming hot heroes vie for the innocent-hearted girl.

Son Ye Jin is sweet and pretty and makes her character likeable and sympathetic - not annoying at all. Her range is impressive. The supporting characters are sympathetic especially the scoundrel Gu with a heart and seemingly cold fiance Seo Dan. The cute bunch of N Korean soldiers are all endearing and the evil and greed in the S Korean family members is painfully familiar.Hollywood hasn't been able to come up with anything fictional of this standard.

That's why I wait."" -Captain Ri.Most people who have watched the entire series, love CLOY, which is one of KDrama's finest series, for some of the following points:1. The writer, Park Ji-eun, who also gave us ""You Who Came from the Star"" is one of the best, knowing how to balance drama, comedy, themes, and closure while keeping her audience intrigued and in love with her characters. The director, Lee Jeong-hyo, who has worked on many series and movies, kept everything focused and carefully paced so that the series steadily evolved each week.2. The cast is one of the best I've seen with immensely beautiful and talented leads, warm, hilarious village ajummas, and Capt. Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.6.

I was hooked by the first episode - the witty script, dialogue, music, songs, cinematography and the palpable chemistry not only between the leads but the whole cast - it really caught me pleasantly off guard!
I have and continue to binge watch - since mid february till now (first week of May), I have completed seven K drama series! Am on my eighth one now.
I do have a clear favourite actor - Hyun Bin and pretty sure, many other talented names will be added to this list.

tt10850932,I liked these drama. I mainly watched this drama because of the high anticipation and reviews. But I don't think it's as good as dots or goblin.I liked the 2nd couple more than the lead couple. So I DON'T THINK the 2nd male lead had to die. There was no basis in his death. I mean the main lead took so much risks. He even escaped to another country to keep his girl safe and not a single thing happened to him.😆😆😆I also hated the fact that Gu seung joo's death was not mourned by any. Not even the lead actress(he was her ex fiance and helped her go back to south korea). I think his last death scene(where the seo dan was taken as hostage) was not well written. It seemed like the writer wanted to finish this as fast as possible.The humour was great especially after they(Hyun bin and his comrades) escaped to south korea. Tbh I really liked the 4 comrades. They were awesome. It's because of them I could complete this show.,neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"I recommended this to my British friend who had script writing work experience. For the first 2 episodes, he said this isn't his style - cheesy romantic comedy. But I recommended him to be patient, if you like to write a story.Few weeks later, he texted me ""I am completely addicted to Crash Landing on You !! I blame on you!!!"" Haha succeed !I truly hope that all of you are wishing North and South Korea reunify one day.. and cry with us..",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"""Even if it breaks my heart because it's a dream that can't come true, I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.""I finished this Drama an hour ago and I am still just sitting here, not knowing what to do,...or to write, for that matter.
I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

The palpable chemistry of both actors could exploded whole North korea, albeit there was very small intimated love scenes. You kept watching laughing, smiling, picking your pillow and crying whole boxed of tissues in one episode. Probably one drama like this in ten years time.

tt10850932,"I finally finished it, 16 episodes and more than 20 hours of total running time. I'm not a fan of Korean Telenovelas, but I decided to give this one a try because of all the hype and also I thought that anything related to North Korea should be interesting.And it turned out to be quite an amazing series. In fact the hardest thing I had to do was resist watching the next episode because once you start watching it, it's pretty hard to stop.I think the North Korean setting is what makes this series unique and great, and also what kept me going thru some cheesy scenes (this is, after all, a Soap Opera). The setting bought the viewers to an exotic, new place with strange customs, and at the same time allowed the ""Fish Out of Water"" Plot Device on both sides of Korea (a minor spoiler there).Aside from that the series is also very well made in terms of Script and Plot Twists. It initially starts out as a Romantic Comedy with incredibly witty, you-will-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing dialogue, and eventually evolves into a Soap Opera Thriller towards the middle of the season with clever Cliffhangers at the end of each Episode.The pacing is fast, there are always a lot of things happening onscreen, and the Cinematography is amazing, especially the scenes in Switzerland which made the place almost look like heaven.My only reservation is that is a bit cheesy at times as I mentioned earlier, and also a bit too wholesome for me, which made it feel a bit too unreal at times. I mean, no-tongue kisses, really?And no sex, despite all those gorgeous people sleeping around in each other's apartments? I think they just wanted the series to be as acceptable for as wide an audience as possible.Despite that, overall I would say that this is no ordinary series, it is much better than much of what I have seen on Netflix so far. I think it is an Instant Classic, a Masterpiece that must be seen. Truly outstanding.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"What can I say about Crash Landing on You that hasn't been said already? For starters this drama belongs to the Premier Division of k drama IMO, in line with Secret Garden, You Who Came From the Stars, Legend of the Blue Sea. Not entirely coincidental these dramas were aided by respectively the same actor, Hyun Bin, and the same screen writer, Park Ji Eun. The question remains: what's so good about it? I think it is the right mix of story, actors & music.The StoryCrash Landing on You combines many proven genres that capture a worldwide audience from the start: action, romance, comedy, drama, tragedy, business, rags & riches. Moreover it is meticulously written according to the golden rules of screen writing:
1. Use the time of your audience in such a way that they will not feel their time was wasted
2. Give people at least one character to root for
3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water
4. Every minute must either reveal more of a character or advance the action
5. Start as close to the end as possible
6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet your characters, make awful things happen to them to show what they are made of
7. Don't try to please the whole world, this only weakens your storyline
8. Give your audience as much information as possible in order to stay hooked.
The storytelling is also rock solid: boy meets girl - they get into trouble - things go from bad to worse - there is a closure but at the same time it keeps us from knowing if new developments are good or bad, hoping for a sequel.The ActorsEven well written stories are made or broken by the cast. In this case the acting of each and everyone was on point. I can't imagine any other actor playing the lead than Hyun Bin (the stern and sturdy North Korean army officer Ri Jung Hyuk) and Son Ye Jin (the sophisticated South Korean chaebol heiress Yoon Se Ri). Also the supporting cast did a great job, with honorable mentions for Yang Kyung Won (sergeant Pyo Chi Su who speaks North Korean to a T according to North Korean defector Kang Nara) and Bang Eun Jin playing the emotionally scarred mother of Se Ri.The MusicSo, we've got our story and the right actors, but the soundtrack is the cherry on top. No surprise this soundtrack leads the Top 10 of most downloaded OST's of ALL TIME at the moment I'm writing this review.RewatchSometimes I can forget a story as soon as the clue has been reached, but I think I will definitely rewatch this drama. There are many layers in the episodes that deserve a re-run.VerdictOverall, if you haven't seen this already, go watch it, and get in line with others who are longing for The Sequel.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"This is my first time reviewing - and this is my first time watching Korean drama TV show - something I never thought I would enjoy having grown up in Hollywood, but I am Super impressed! The 4 main characters are perfect in their roles, and the supporting actors were great! I love the build up from the first episode all the way to the end. It has cute interactions as well as heartbreaking ones, and just an overall enjoyable drama in Korean. I started watching other Korean tv shows but none of them are as well made as this one, I highly recommend this if it's your first time watching korean drama and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!The story is about a South Korean smart lady boss who happens to come from a wealthy family and meets a North Korean soldier after accidentally being swept away in a hurricane. Both actors were great in their roles, although I find the female actor Son ye jin a better actor, the male actor Hyun Bin is quite handsome and cute in his role. The supporting actors are all quite good and thought the director did a good job - especially with the build up of the story.

So I had to make an IMDB account in order to write a review to this surprisingly impressionable show. Maybe it will help my grieving process.The show is well balanced, and takes you through a huge reservoir of emotions. I've cried and laugh, felt fear and joy. At the beginning I wasn't all that sure. In the first episodes I thought the story seemed to predictable, and at times whimsical. But boy was I wrong. After two episodes I couldn't stop watching. I finished the entire series in three days.The main characters have captivating stories, and the actors are able to portray thoughts and emotions in a superb manner. Even though I couldn't understand the language, I felt like I could.The script is well written. There is no unnecessary dialogue, the character say what is needed. And nothing is over explained. The main plot has many layers, and I catch myself thinking back at different moments in the storyline more than once during the day. The side stories give you a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people in a country far different from my own. Even the seemingly dim neighbors get a special place in your heart. The acting is superb. The mimic of some of the supporting actors seem a bit dramatic at first, but somehow it just fits. Everything feels natural, something that is often lacking in Hollywood productions. The main cast are able to give us a nuanced portrait of human emotions.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop here. All I wanted to say was: WATCH IT.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

Every single character was compelling with their own unique personalities and characteristics.I'm a huge fan of kdramas, but I'm convinced any casual lover of TV would LOVE this show. It's not too cheesy like some Kdramas and it was VERY well produced with a beautiful score and cinematography.I have to give them props for the realism of the portrayal of North Korea. The North Korean characters felt like normal, everyday people and weren't vilified or ostracized just based on their nationality.I don't want to spoil too much of it, but I will say that at first I was bit upset about the ending but it was so well executed that it's grown on me and I'm satisfied with it.I DO want to talk about the elephant in the room-the main leads' acting. Oh my lord, they are PHENOMENAL actors. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are some of the best actors I've ever seen-topping most western actors easily. Son Ye-jin's crying is so convincing and doesn't across as faked or forced. And you can really feel how much Jeong-hyeok loves Se-ri thanks to Hyun Bin's portrayal. Now that I've finished the series I'm gonna make sure to watch EVERYTHING else these actors are in.I give this series an 11 out of 10 stars. It's now in my top 5 favorite TV shows of all time.Don't let the run time of the episodes or the different language throw you off from watching this.

tt10850932,"Where was I till now? Why didn't I ever try any Korean Drama? Why didn't I know about Hyun Bin?
This is my first ever K-Drama and I'll be honest here. I loved it. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and an excellent series. Everything is amazing - Story, Main Leads, Their Chemistry, Acting, Thrill, Action Sequence, Star Cast, Background Score, Music. I completed this series in 3 days and I am suffering from Post Drama Syndrome now. I can't get over it. After completing this series, like everyone else, I am searching everything about CLOY on YouTube, Google.This is such a series which will never leave you. No matter how hard you'll try you can't forget it. You'll fall in love with all the characters, be it Captain Ri Jung Hyuk, Yoon Se ri, Gu Seung joon or Park Kwang beom. They all justified their characters and got immense love from viewers. You'll cry with them, laugh with them and start feeling their pain & emotions.And what to say about Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin chemistry. It's magical. You'll start rooting for them. Hyun Bin was Rustic and Rough in NK but Classic and Dashing in SK. He can be tough and cute at the same time. He totally nailed his role and I read that he learned Piano for this role. Son Ye Jin was a great choice for the role of Yoon Se Ri. She played her role as a helpless SK Woman in NK and a strong, confident businesswoman in SK. I especially loved her character development.I have fallen in love with CLOY. And I am definitely going to watch other K-Dramas now. And this is my first ever review on IMDb. I created my account on IMDb to let South Korean people know that I have fallen in love with your country, your culture, your actors, and film industry. Lots of love from India! This series made me feel like visiting South Korea and having some friends from that land in my life :) Lots of love!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"If you have been frustrated by all the recent K-dramas that have been marketed as ""romance"" films just because they include some romantic content, I am pleased to report that this one is the genuine article. Yes, the plot is peppered with lots of suspense, action & comedy as well, but those elements always remain peripheral to the unfolding love story.Aside from being technically polished, this show also boasts a great (if understated) script and cast who were respectively endearing or despicable (depending on their roles). I also loved the layered backstories, deep friendships and various inter-dynamics among the characters. Plus, despite some bittersweet moments, the unconventional ending was happy and hopeful.And although this IS a romance film, I just have to say: THE COMEDY!!! Unlike many K-dramas which might get a chuckle from me with slapstick moments or exaggerated expressions, the humor in this show comes from hilarious culture-related misunderstandings, misinterpretations, shocks and awkwardness that left me in stitches. I nearly woke my kids up a few times because I couldn't stop laughing! And that gaming scene with the ""Memories of the Alhambra"" Easter egg nearly killed me. :DOf course there were some weak points. In particular, I thought many of the hand-to-hand combat scenes seemed a bit unrealistic and looked too rehearsed. There were also a number of scenes that were overly melodramatic, poorly executed or just outright impossible (the tandem paragliding scene, for example). But considering that this show is obviously meant to be a departure from reality, I can't really count these issues as faults. No film can do everything perfectly, right?In summary, if you like K-drama, are looking for a romance story that will make you laugh out loud, cry a little, and you don't mind having to continually suspend your disbelief, you should give this one a try. Highly recommended!ROMANCE RATING: 8.5/10
I thought Hyun Bin & Son YeJin had believable chemistry and they shared 5+ kiss scenes (very generous by K-drama standards!) The more serious kisses were also quite long, and fell somewhere between PG-13 & NC-17 for passion level. To be totally honest, I felt both Hyun Bin & Son YeJin's performances in this film were a bit too understated for my personal taste, but they still delivered when it came to the romantic parts, so it's all good! :)",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

I loved Gu's gentlemanly mannerisms and charms. I was swooning over him.I hope to find a love as strong as amongst these characters one day that will last forever.",,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"This series was not really what I had expected. It turned out to be basically a soap opera, albeit partly in an unusual setting. Sixteen 80-90 minute long episodes was way, way too much to tell this story. The subplots, especially the one with Jeong-hyeok's brother, were not very interesting. Combined with too much Korean over-the-top style acting in some parts, it gets a bit dull after a while.The show can be divided into two parts: The first half in North Korea, and the second in South Korea. The show is essentially over once Se Ri is back in South Korea, but at that point we still have 7 episodes, or roughly 10 hours, to go.The first half is without a doubt the best, a solid 9. The second half could easily be summarized in one 90 minute episode, because it's painfully drawn out with plenty of slow motion romantic shots and cheesy Korean ballads blaring repeatedly, with a score of 4-5. In the end, a combined score of 7 is quite generous considering the second half which is quite a slog to get through.The pair in the lead are good. The character which turned out to be the most interesting, Seo Dan, isn't given a whole lot to do.It was interesting to see a portrayal (realistic or not) of daily life in North Korea, in the city as well as the countryside. One thing I liked in particular is that the North Koreans were portrayed as humans, and not mindless automatons.I travelled around in North Korea a few years ago, and some of the exteriors of Pyongyang were spot on (like the view from Kim Il Sung square of the Taedong river with the Juche tower in the background), others were not, especially Pyongyang at night. The fictional international hotel in the show is clearly meant to represent Koryo Hotel (where I stayed), judging from the exterior (although it's missing a skybridge). The interior however looks nothing like the real thing.6-8 episodes which focused on the actual story would have been perfect.",neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"I watched ""Descendants of the Sun"" and wondered if I'd see another series that could match it. Then, I watched ""Mr. Sunshine,"" and thought, ""there's no way I'll ever see another series like this."" Imagine the joy of being wrong twice! Along comes, ""Crash Landing on You,"" which may end up being my favorite of all of them. It's a toss-up between this and Mr. Sunshine. In short, this is one of the best series I've ever seen, and for me, the Korean Dramas I've watched have not disappointed at all as most are character and plot driven. In fact, overall, I've seen better quality shows out of Korea and Japan in the last several years than I have with American shows.The writing, and especially, the editing is some of the best I've ever seen. The plot is intricately weaved, not using some of the typical cliches and devices as some shows do when trying to get the two main characters together. In this case, we're given the beautiful wise lesson on screen: happiness is in the journey. Not the destination.Seri is a woman who owns her own company and is part of an extremely rich family. Her world, despite the money and success, is cold and empty. She sits alone in a massive penthouse. She has all of the luxuries that one could ask for. However, she has a family, especially her half-siblings, who are about as cut-throat as anyone could imagine. She doesn't realize what is missing in her life until a storm, while para-gliding, blows her across the border into North Korea.Ri Jeong-Hyeok is a North Korean captain who comes across Seri. At first, he and his unit of men aren't sure who Seri is and why she's there. Ri Jeong-Hyeok was a master pianist before joining the military, and intent on solving the mystery of his older brother's death. At first, he seems very straight-forward and unassuming, while underneath is a man full of life, passion, and love.The first set of episodes of Seri trying to adapt to life in a North Korean village are especially hilarious. Imagine a pampered woman suddenly having to go without electricity? How to take a bath...how to cook, etc. As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I know full well what this adaptation feels like!Perhaps for the first time in her life, Seri not only finds a connection with Ri Jeong-Hyeok, but also with the village women and also with the members of Ri Jeong-Hyeok's unit. It's ironic that she had to cross the border to find a group of people who were more like family for her than her real family back home!The best plots are ones that aren't forced or contrived, and this one doesn't use either one. We are taken effortlessly from North Korea into South Korea as Seri and Ri Jeong-Hyeok find themselves at the center of two sinister plots, each one contrived by people on either side (North and South Korea).Of course, the biggest question is: despite the situations they must survive and unravel, can they spend a life together? Is it feasible for two people, from the only divided country in the world, be able to have a relationship? North Korea might as well be the darkside of the moon, as communications between the people of the two countries is non-existent. Finding the answer to this question is the beauty of the journey of this series.The entire cast is simply terrific. They meticulously and effortlessly give us endearing characters who are absolutely hilarious at times and heartfelt at others. All are also able to deftly convey a range of emotions, especially the two leads in Hyun Bin and Ye-Jin Soon whose chemistry is much of what makes this series so incredible.The editing is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie or series as we are given scenes in one episode, only to realize that we were only given a partial look at the whole. Each time, we are given a joyful surprise and many, ""Ah-ha"" moments when we realize what really happened!Apparently North Korean defectors served as consultants on this series to try and make life in North Korea depicted as accurately as possible.Some might feel that the ending isn't the most ideal, but that's why I like it. It's realistic. They end up making the absolute most of the time that they have. These contrived, formulaic ""happy endings"" simply do not reflect life or relationships themselves.I have been watching movies and television series for over 45 years, and frankly, this series absolutely blew me away. It captured my imagination and my heart as I see a veritable ""Romeo and Juliet"" struggling to find ways to connect, love, and protect each other. They are such a short distance away from each other across the border, but as I stated before, the distance might as well be from the earth to the moon. I love stories about relationships, where the two people have to find a way to overcome the obstacles and pitfalls laid out before them. Two people with enough love and determination will always find a way. And that is why the joy of watching this series is in the journey and not the destination! And this journey was simply sweet, magical, and joyful. What more could you ask for in a great series?",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

Hyun Bin(Ri Jeong Hyeok) and Son Ye Jin(Yon Seri) are the perfect couple and both of them really fit in this drama. I don't know what to say anymore, but I really love this kdrama. Finally, I hope to see season 2 of Crash Landing On You especially I hope the the director will fulfill the viewer's wish that this drama will have season 2.

The whole ""paragliding accident"" can seem a little far fetched, but the story really really evolves from that. Cried like a baby during the last episode and will probably need some time to emotionally recover from this show. Don't think I've ever watched something that would get to me this much, being able to portray such a powerful love story without a single sex scene, just wow.",,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"1st part was enjoyable. It was nice though there's no way she'd land in North Korea like that. The 2nd part was cringe af. It got too repetitive. A million times of ""it was my fault"", ""no it was my fault not yours"", ""you're getting hurt because of me"", ""I will protect her with my life"". I got so bored of hearing the same sentences over and over again and the lead guy's countless 'poems'. I enjoyed the 4 friends tho the whole time. It also didn't really have a storyline. It's very basic, cringe and clingy.",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"I am a bit disappointed watching this series since I have high hope towards this series cos I love Hyun Bin very much and Park Ji Eun is one of the best writer so far.The storyline is too simple for 16 episode drama, it could have been fit to 4 episode, even can fit into a 2.5 hours movie. I find the story is so boring that I couldnt finish it and I gave up on 11th episode.Compared to previous Park Ji Eun project (ie. My Love from The Star), the story was too plain. The acting is good, the cast is good, the biggest weakness here is the plot.I dont understand about the hype of its drama, but nothing I can relate towards this drama message to its viewer. Its just typical romance story.",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

The main actors Hyun Bin and Son Jin are great with their performance and bring the real two characters to life. Cannot think of any two other actors to do these roles.
The story line which takes place in two countries make you feel like there are two dramas within one drama and therefore there is no time to get bored.
All the other supporting characters do a great contribution in bringing the story to life and i believe this is a great masterpiece and i don't have any complains about anything by far.
It has all the components (thriller, Romance, Comedy) in exact right composition. Highly Recommend",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"On one of my nights of sleepless not filtering in and allowing me to catch some Zzzz'z I thought I would take ROKU and wake up Netflix. Now I know I am an old goat of nearly 68, when I layed eyes on Ye-jin Son, the Yoon Se-Ri character, I was smitten. Just a most gorgeous woman in these days pop creations bombarding us from all sides, it takes me to need a foreign movie to capture me and hold my attention for over 4 to 5 hours straight! I told my wife that she needed to watch Crash Landing On You. It is in Korean, but subtitles are well easy to read. This movie offers it all. Greedy siblings, a corrupt N Korean officer and some FANTASTIC scores being played. Well as luck would have it, I told my wife all I required her to watch was the first episode. Today was an off day for her and we took in 6 episodes. I am peppered with questions, and there is a new, rabid fan in our home. Too boot, the acting is much better than the pinheads we are used to in the states. Do yourself a favor.

tt10850932,"This is a dramedy with absurd premisses. Very different from almost everything else we have seen, even though we watch our share of Korean movies and shows. The story is good and you'd be tempted to binge. But what makes this show shine are the great actors - we have laughed so much, cried so much, it is a rare gem.A bit of the acting is too much, as should be expected, and a few characters are quite one-dimensional. But it all comes together exceptionally well. Strong recommendation, especially good to escape the covid-19 crisis and all; immerse in this and fall in love with both main actors and their supporting cast.",neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt10850932,"After all the recommendation and the hype, I had to give this a watch. And truth is? The first half was blatantly amazing. It kept you interested and just binging episode after episode. The writing is smart, witty, and creative. The acting is superb.However, in the 2nd half, things pretty much fell apart as if the writers ran out of ideas. The pace slowed down to a drag that often I found myself skipping bits here and there. They also included way too many side stories that it was hard to follow the main plot. The whole thing became convoluted. It was extremely disappointing.Perhaps what was most disappointing was how unrealistic it became that you lose the suspension of disbelief. In the first half, every time they were in trouble or there was a seemingly impossible situation, they came up with creative and unexpected ways to solve it. For example, the boat incident that they resolved in the hilarious kissing scene.However, in the 2nd half, the writing was completely cliche. The protagonist took on dozens of armed bad guys with his bare hands like he's a comic book hero. But the disappoint was the fact he was in a jam and we were expecting a creative twist that never came.The run time also expanded in the 2nd half, running around 1 hr and 20-30 mins, almost 33% more than the 1st half. But that is not because they had more material, just the opposite. They spent so much time on slow motion dramatic shots, crying and talking, etc... It was becoming annoying, hence why I skipped bits and pieces trying to get back to the storyline.Finally, the ending was completely unsatisfying. I have already predicted they would end up back in Switzerland, but the notion that these two will just now forever meet once a year for 2 weeks in Switzerland? That was not a very satisfying ending because there are so many different and better ways that could've gone. I mean, wasn't he studying music in Switzerland in the beginning? That would mean he was staying there at least a semester to several years right? And he didn't finish his study because of his brother's death? So could he not have finished his study? That would at least allow them to stay in Switzerland months to years instead of every 2 weeks.And eventually his parents would be dead, then why not just defect to South Korea? He doesn't need to worry about his father's wealth, the girl is rich, infinitely rich.Anyways, though the major story is new, but many of the story elements are actually taken from other dramas, a lot I recognize from My Girl with Lee Da Hae. For example, the rich and poor contrast, the double lovers, the lying, and even some of the jokes. Compare to My Girl, this series is average at best. My Girl is superior by far with a consistent storyline that carries you from episode 1 to 16 flawlessly.So 6/10 would be generous.",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"The story line is very predictable, very boring, almost nothing much really happens through out the entire series.. poor performance from the lead male and female starts.. no chemistry what so ever between the leads.. unnecessarily long episodes.. very boring long conversations.. I think this drama could have ended in 5 or 6 episodes max.. but anyway the rest of supporting actors did a great job that's why I give it six",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"I don't watch much KD or Korean movies as so many are the same kind of romance drama repackaged. So far this one has kept my interest except when Yoon Se-ri stopped being the strong woman she started out as.
One reason this KD does not have a higher rating in SK and US is that it airs on cable channel/pay TV/ Netflix which normally have a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS).",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

I would have liked a little bit more action and happier ending. The idea of them meeting just 2 weeks per yeat in Swiss made me very sad. It also bothered me that the con artist died... Why? He was a very good man in the end. It was the only moment during the movie when i cried. It would have been better to leave him alive.
Besides than this, the differences betwen North and South are so well displayed. It made me search the internet more about North Korea and see if things really are like that. Good job for the story writer.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

It is well-played and portrays strongly each and every emotions and feelings of the characters. Amazing plot which is far best than ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance. I never expected this kdrama being out of the ordinary melodrama and tragic plot. This is so balance. Anyone who will watch this series will not be left heartbroken but will feel hopeful and loved. It feels so good watching it.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"One of the most well written and acted Korean dramas I have ever seen! The main couple have SO much chemistry and are such a good match despite their differences. There are multiple story lines and characters but they fit so well together. My favorite characters (besides the main couple) are the soldiers helping Captain Ri and the group of women from the military camp. So funny!The plot includes what life might be like in North Korea and it's fascinating! Power outages, hopping salespeople for when the train breaks down, strict dress/hair code, etc. They come from different worlds and it's interesting to see them each discover the other's world. Absolutely brilliant!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"Ok, so this show is simply amazing. It has the perfect pace in the show. The reason i say this is because many K-Dramas tend to lag during the middle of the season to meet the 16 episodes they want to end at. Now this show literally doesn't lag it really all connects well and is intense and you just want too see the next episode NOW but have to wait a week on netflix for the next two episodes (its so hard to wait!). The two mains are absolutely perfect. The other actors in this show do so well too. You really get involved in the characters because they give a good background even to not main characters they at least give you something about them and you really care about the characters in this show and want too see more! Def a must watch! Do it watch it now!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,The best so far...Watched the whole 8 episode in one seating. Looking forward to next episodes thinking what would happen next!! The story line is unpredictable.

Even Captain Ri's father scenes were so funny even they're not trying to.Please continue to produce more!!!,positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"The story is funny and emotional and sometimes also exciting. I really liked the first few episodes (good humor) and the development of the relationship between the main characters (in the beginning at least). I felt however that the chemistry between the main characters could have been better resp. Was not delivered. I also got bored by them halfway through the drama and was actually rather looking forward to seeing the secondary couple and their evolving relationship. Without the secondary characters (and here I mean the soldats, the women from the village and the other couple), I might not have finished the drama... although the scenery in Switzerland was so nice :) Gotta visit my own country next before going abroad #covid19",neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

I would rank these two series as the best thing I have seen on television in years.Crash Landing on You builds up such an emotional head of steam, driven by the predicament in which the leads find themselves and great central performances.

It had everything. Emotions, Perfect main couple, annoying antagonist, great side characters and their struggles. I loved it would be an understatement. This was the second time I cried watching a tv series after the red wedding in GOT. More people need to watch this amazing story.

I wouldn't even call it a flaw coz I prefer series with shorter episodes.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

I am not a K-drama fan, tho. However, this drama leaves me with such an indescribable feeling. I was laughing, crying, thrilling, experiencing lots of emotions. I didn't know anything about North Korean and doubt it to be real until I watched this, I googled the information about the relationship between NK and SK, I saw how a North Koreans react to this drama. Wow, they actually well researched, the plot was excellent, the cinematography was so amazing, and don't forget the after credit scenes. Thanks to all cast, their chemistry was beyond everything. Usually, I would find some missing details after rewatching the movie/series. But this drama is exceptional, what I found was perfection. A must watch in 2020.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

The story is amazingly compelling and stays with you long after you've finished watching, the main lead has incredible chemistry, the cast is solid and gives strong performance, and the settings (particularly the North Korean ones) are so detailed and well-illustrated. I cried, laughed, and swooned throughout the entire 16 episodes. Would definitely recommend watching!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"Let's be honest, the lead actress played by Ye-jin Son really carried the team on this one, her acting was very good but the lead actor played by Hyun Bin could barely give us more than two different facial expressions. I found it so frustrating looking at his same blank dumbfounded look the entire time when there could've been more emotions. The love scenes between these two were not intense enough on screen (it could be because if the blank looks?). The supporting actors played by Kim Jung-hyun (the con man) and Yang Kyung-won (loud soilder) were very well portrayed, captivating, and amusing to watch.
Overall, a good storyline, enough suspense and twists to be engaging, and some heart felt scenes relating to friendship and family love.
I much preferred the love story, romance and love scenes from the series Descendants of the Sun.",neutral,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"This show would be so good if the main characters weren't so blatantly stupid. Minor tweaks to the storyline would have made it a great show. For example, if you expect a military caption to try staunch the wound of someone who has just been shot, rather than cry over their body looking around for help like a helpless child. If multiple people are trying to kill you, you don't return to your house and chill out for an evening. These plot holes are so so easy to fix. But in the end it was just insufferable.

tt10850932,"I landed on CLOY by accident, a tip on a french site. I am still shocked after having watched the full serie in a few days,
The whole thing works, the alchemy between the actors, the story line, the unexpected twists, the non standard story telling, the humor , the slow pace focused on the emotional rollercoasters of the different heroes.
The further it goes, the most unbelievable sweet it turns into, that I would normally switch to a different program, but you can't escape it, You get into the Korean story line, the obvious dilemmas in the relationship that 's building up and up.There should not be a second season, the end is what it is, but it will remain one of a kind TV impact for me, as I experienced ""the breakfast club"" a long time ago.

In short, several things stand out:The quality of the plot - very dynamic, with an incredible high pace and really well written. Every episode has so much depth that could really be squeezed in a whole season. The plot also offers a really high range of comedy, drama, action and romantic stories. In most of the cases, the caracters make the most reasonable and logical actions - and this is not always common;The vibe of North Korea - a credible, deep, human and interesting dive in the most unknown culture and society of the world;The quality of the actors - some of them, specially some of the secondary actors really stand out and create an impact with a really low screen time;It was hard for me to explain to others why I was absolutly hooked to a korean drama.

I'll have to admit, this was my first Korean romance series! We needed a break from the tense political news & wanted to watch something we could escape to. After the first episode, I was not sure what to think as it was a bit slow. But after that first episode, things pick up and completely submerse you. It's everything all wrapped up into one: romance, drama, thriller, suspense, comedy. The acting is so amazing!!!! I'm in awe of this wonderful production. I laughed in the beginning & middle, while I cried and gasped in the last half. Watch all the way until the end, you'll love it!

It was quite slow moving, but had plenty of tension, action and laughs along the way. The way it ended was interesting, as I guess it was quite realistic - but also would you want to live your life like that? Well, I guess it's better than nothing right?Anyway, I'm not sure how much I can take as gospel the information gleaned about life in North Korea from this show, and I'd never presume to believe I'm now an expert - but it was still interesting to get that insight.I loved all the supporting characters as well as the main hero and heroine.

The chemistry between the leads is amazing, and their acting beyond fantastic. As for the 'side' characters, for me they were an integral part of the series and not 'side' at all. On the contrary, they gave life to the story, especially the North Korean soldiers (the friends of Jeong-Hyeok), whether with their funny side or humane side. Most important though was the beautiful love story between Se-ri and Jeong-Hyeok, which made the first drastically change in character and the second go the extra mile and do what seems impossible to protect his love... let alone the love gestures he so silently offers to Se-ri (especially those shown in the last few episodes).

I've been waiting for that dissapointing moment since episode one, and I'm baffled but still waiting. So far this show has literally been perfect, at least for me. The casting and acting have surpassed even my high expectations, the settings have been jaw dropping, the attention to detail when it comes to North Korea, even though it's not, it totally sells it that it is. You can tell the writer really took out all the guns on this one and tried to do her best work, and it shows. True, there's still six episodes so anything could happen, but it's hard to imagine how this show could miss the mark when it has done sooo well so far. Not one episode has disappointed, not one characters, not one scene, not one line delivery. I foresee this show becoming an all time best, and if it doesn't it'll be a crime. If you like K Dramas, I dont see how you can not enjoy this show even a little bit.",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

At least this was what I thought it was...However, the plot is ruined by just too much action scenes, too many unfortunate events, and too little romance&comedy which was supposed to be the genre. The starred couple is even rarely seen together during the episodes!K-dramas are normally 40-45 mins. long, yet this one lasts for 1.5 hours for some reason. It is not hard to observe that they pushed to make it this long by using uncalled scenes, flashbacks and everything.

tt10850932,"This drama is interesting as much of it is in North Korea. The North Korean accent is well done, the living style is well done, the North Korean government is also well done.However many parts of the drama are unrealistic:
-Son Ye Jin comes into North Korea after being sucked into a tornado. It makes zero sense that she survived the tornado while paragliding with no serious injury, and only had some cuts and bruises.
-The attitudes of the North Korean army members are too soft. It is unbelievable that there are so many nice guys.
She had a different accent the whole time and no one found that suspicious. Even if she is a secret agent in SK she would still not forget her North Korean accent.-The selling of SK products at the market seems too easy. IN NK people are known for getting killed in such situations, so even people from the army buying those products are too unreal.",negative,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"
tt10850932,"This is a korean drama that I am glad i saved to watch whilst we are globally in lockdown. I know it will be good as I have seen some post in social media and some online review so I already have some expecations.Usually when you have good expectation you tend to be a bit disappointed when you didnt meet it. But this one did not disappoint one bit.
Characters in this drama are perfectly chosen. HYun Bin is dashing both in his military and civilian clothes. my gosh he is a delight to watch in all angles. His cold reaction is both endearing and manly. Son ye jin is a strong street wise woman that doesnt just cry and get scared in the corner. They have a very good chemistry that you would want to be put to reality. This is not a teen comedy drama nor any other drama that is over the top. This drama is a an adult kind of love that attraction started from the very first episode and Yoon Se ri has said that in a comedic way from the beginning. The risks they take to save each others lives prove the love they have for each other. The thoughtfullness that one has for each other is remarkable. You feel their pain and happiness and the difficulties they face for not being allowed to be together just because they are in a conflicting nation. The amount of times they say their goodbyes are all so painful that you would think it would always be their last time to see each other.
The supporting characters hyun Bin subordinates played their part really well. They show how a north korean would react to the many things that are just ordinary in SK but lacked in NK. The women villagers are overpowering in the beginning but it shows that the people in NK are just normal human being capable of showing emotions doing their day to day lives in a small village. I have done some researched after watching this drama and it says the lifestyle by the north korean depicted in this drama is true to what is happening in there and I would like believe that.
There are no loose end on this drama. Everything is very well explained as to what, how, why something happen. Which is what i love on korean drama. You will not have the urge to throw a glass to the Television screen in frustration which we sometimes feel in some hollywood dramas.
The writer is very clever that no one among the main characters ended with defection from each others country. They subtly choose Switzerland as a neutral country to stay. Brilliant!",positive,"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"

tt29569035,"Okay, as an American who lived abroad in Korea for years, Korean drama shows generally are a hit. This one is also a hit BUT I will say for a drama immersion show, the soundboard effects really killed it for me :( One moment I would be completely immerged in this show, it's got an amazing and convincing cast, a GREAT plot, good character build up but the moment you become completely enthralled, it hits you with cat fight noises in scenes and other such unique soundboard effects that would grip you back to reality ,going 'huh?'. It has the hype & buildup to be a HUGE hit on its own so I'm not sure why the creators decided this would make it better. So far though, this show has the buildup and plot to be as big as hit series The Walking Dead, but those sound effects need to go imo.

I mention this, because it kind of has the feel of some of the good humour from some animes I like.

tt29569035,"I'm searching for a supernatural romance and tbh this is fulfilling for me. I don't care about the plot or how unlogical/logical this show is either. The visuals are mesmerizing and are the ones that attract people to watch and I kinda like some of the romance scenes. But sometimes the long ahh eye contact scenes with dramatic ost doesn't click with me as it kinda feels like it's exaggerated and cringe, but for me it isn't a big problem. This drama is making me excited for the next episodes even though idk what kind of story awaits in the future.Tbh I have no problem with the FL swaying easily as in my opinion it is realistic, as I sway easily either, example when my bias is wrecked by another member of a certain group, or when i had a small crush on a certain someone then changes the next day(well no one knows about me having a very abnormal and crazy mind), I think it's okay as long as we're not overly confident about it. I just hope that the FL doesn't do any more embarrassing thing because of her being swayed easily, because sometimes I kinda see it coming😨 but for know it's not that deep.I'm a fan of cliche stories as I just watched kdramas and I think this show is suitable for the ones who enjoys this kind of story.

Lack of chemistry between leads. I'm sure both of these actors are good separately but I don't see any real relationship between these two3. Annoying male main character who isn't likeable. Arrogant, superficial, silly, what is there to like I don't know.4. Not funny. I should just avoid Korean rom coms, the humour is very silly and unless that's your thing, just not enjoyable5. Slow.

tt29569035,"It seemed good at first. Recommended for someone who hasn't watched many kdramas. Because the plot is so worn out, it becomes predictable for someone who has watched other dramas about reincarnation.1) The tragic past resembles 'Legend of the blue sea'
So, I could guess that they had a sad ending in the previous life but they'll have a happy ending in the new life
2) Even the ending resembled Legend of blue sea. Female lead takes a bullet to save the male lead...meh too cliche
3) Male lead at first perishes but then returns...pretty much predictable. Just like goblin returns after perishing
4) Being reincarnated as a demon because he did many bad things in his life...this concept is the same as the grim reaper in 'The Guardian: lonely & great god'

A visually explosive scene between a confused Demon (Song Kang) and the mysterious snaggle-toothed baglady blew me away. There is a big dose of cosmic philosophy entering the picture and it quite unnerved me. This is no ordinary Korean rom-com, that's for sure. I stayed for all the lingering doe-eyed ""will they or won't they"" gazes, the rockstar Demon's high stylin' wardrobe, the gleaming CGI frozen-in-time moments, and the unmasking of a human monster obssessed with a schmaltzy-eerie k-pop lovesong.

tt29569035,"...but at least the Titanic had a band.MY DEMON is a series with no organizing theme. Is it about the migrating tattoo? A would-be killer on the loose? A dysfunctional family drama? What we get is a number of false starts that lead nowhere. It feels like too many writers were pulling this mess in different directions.Hey, everybody--your homework is to read the green DEMON'S MANUAL. The rules keep changing, but it's got to be in there. Here's the question: Can demons be shot and killed--or not?The attraction between the two leads is all about physical appearance. These generic lovers do generic things: he brings her flowers, they watch a horror movie, they ride a bike, she cooks, etc. Etc. I couldn't find any convincing individuality-or chemistry. In fact, it sure looked like Song Kang used his hand to block their first kiss.And Do-Hee isn't the brightest cookie in the jar. It takes until Episode 14 for her to show the slightest curiosity about her husband's day job. She's horrified, of course, but she sure gets over it quickly. ""Oh, you take the souls of desperate people who are then tortured forever? And one of them's my dad? No problemo.""And I'm sorry--because I really like him-Song Kang is totally miscast as a demon. For most of the series he's sweet and loving or having a fashion moment. He's just not the baddy the audience deserves. I blame the writers because Song Kang can ACT when he's got a good script (see Navillera).The secondary characters engage in a lot of silliness that never adds up to a single genuinely funny moment. As for God, s/he just bloviates about all the things she can't do. No help there, though I have a feeling she'll come through in the end.Later: I finished the series, and while a lot of the silly stuff was wrapped up, I can't see that anything important was resolved. A minor character is going to be damned for all eternity--someone who absolutely didn't deserve it. But no one in this series has a moral compass, so no one cares--as long as the big romance is saved. A lot of filler in the last two episodes. I was so ready for this one to end.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The narrative delves into this theme with a nuanced understanding, using its characters and their interactions to reflect on the corrupting influence of greed and power in society.The chemistry between the human and demon characters is the heartbeat of the series. Their love story is portrayed with such authenticity and depth that it transcends the fantastical elements of the plot. Their journey, filled with obstacles and societal prejudices, is a testament to the enduring power of love and acceptance.Moreover, 'My Demon' is a masterclass in storytelling, with its plethora of twists and turns that keep viewers guessing.

tt29569035,"Embark on a whirlwind adventure with My Demon, the latest sensation to sweep the K-drama scene. Picture this: a contract marriage with an immortal demon, a sizzling tango in the streets, and our leads beating up goons with their combined special powers. Intrigued? You should be. This series is as fun as K-dramas get, offering a thrilling ride filled with chemistry, amusing banter, and well-timed humor.Meet Do Do Hee, the CEO of Mirae F&B, a subsidiary of the formidable Mirae Group led by her strong adoptive mother, Ju Cheon Sook. When a disastrous matchmaking attempt leads her to a blind date with the 200-year-old Demon Jeong Gu Won, little does she know that her life is about to take a wild turn. A series of events binds them together, with Gu Won's tattoo - the source of his power - transferred to Do Hee.As Do Hee and Gu Won navigate their newfound connection, tragedy strikes with the sudden death of Cheon Sook, leaving Do Hee to inherit the Mirae Empire under one condition: she must marry within a year. Thus begins a violent power struggle between Do Hee and her adopted siblings, who stop at nothing to prevent Mirae from slipping into her hands.Determined to uncover the truth behind Cheon Sook's death and tired of being underestimated her whole life, Do Hee proposes a marriage of convenience to Gu Won. She'll inherit Mirae and gain a powerful bodyguard, while he'll retain access to his supernatural abilities.But My Demon isn't your typical gloomy supernatural drama. Song Kang brings a refreshing twist to Gu Won, infusing the character with humor and mischief. Far from the brooding archetype, Gu Won is chaotic yet endearing, with a youthful energy that complements his demon status. Meanwhile, Kim Yoo Jung shines as Do Do Hee, exuding steely grace and intelligence as she navigates the complexities of her new role and relationship.The chemistry between Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung is undeniable, igniting the screen with every interaction. Their dynamic portrayal of two seemingly different individuals who find common ground is electrifying and utterly captivating.Not to be overlooked is Kim Hae Sook's portrayal of Ju Cheon Sook, whose character transcends stereotypes with her shrewdness and empathy, adding depth to the narrative.While My Demon keeps viewers guessing with its intriguing plot twists and power struggles, it's not without its flaws. Secondary characters may feel one-dimensional at times, but they serve to enhance the central storyline.In essence, My Demon may not be a profound love story like Hotel Del Luna or Goblin, but it doesn't aim to be. It's a modern, light-hearted take on supernatural romance that delivers entertainment, engagement, and impeccable execution.

Chaebol adopts, orphan, which evidently happens to orphans in Korea almost as often as parents get killed in a car crash.3. Chaebol family is horrible.4. There's a demon. Happens all the time. The demon usually either has a boss who tells him/her the rules of being a demon, or in this case, has an instruction manual.5. There's a psycho killer. Because every romantic comedy needs a psycho killer. But the psycho killer only makes random appearances as necessary to create opportunities for the male lead to rescue the female lead.6. Orphan becomes the only nice person in the chaebol family and is incredibly successful.7. executives in the orphan's company are a bunch of silly idiots. Because evidently it's very common to have a brilliant CEO supported by dimwits who are department managers or vice presidents. As successful as she is, I guess she wasn't able to hire all the brilliant graduates of Seoul National University.8. Demon has silly sidekicks too.9.

Then when i saw from the start , i loved the story.Beauty catches the eyes but Character catches the heart.This drama has both. Whole drama gives visual relief.The Characters of main cast in the drama are very nice.The main cast(4 in total as I saw on wikipedia) of My demon do natural acting like if each is really into the soul of each character of drama.Speciality is that the show keeps big truths towards viewers.Many things are kept in suspense.Things like devil's heart change towards human emotions , greed of humans in their tough times , devil's past when he was a human , his transformation into devil ,etc. Are kept here ,some are in suspense.Such things need big truths to be shown as a solution. If the drama gives those to the viewers, it will become a masterpiece because it will present the truth .Truth makes you stronger. This drama can become stronger than any other drama.All is well if end is well.I gave 5 stars because only half story is before us.The best is yet to come.All the best.THE ADVICE TO THE VIEWER IS THAT ENJOY THE DRAMA AND TRY TO FIND THOSE DEEP TRUTHS HIGHLIGHTED IN ITS STORY .",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt29569035,"Korean Drama '' My Demon '' is a fantasy romantic comedy with enough comical moments, beautiful cinematography, and an enjoyable love story.The drama has a strong start, with pretty scenes and impressive cinematography that blends nicely with the comedy reliefs that the drama adds here and there. The family drama is quite enjoyable as well, with many melodramatic moments. The crime case as well has some intense moments.The love story, on the other hand, is basic and predictable. And yet, it is a guilty pleasure, with enough romantic moments and cheesy scenes to keep things interesting.The performances, in addition, were all great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, seven out of ten.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

They are professional, the performances are unlike the show, everything is like real life, the stories is beautiful and exciting and the PD is excellent.I hope that in the near future, both Yoo Jung and Song Kang will be able to create work together again.

tt29569035,"I was hooked on this drama in the first half of the series; it was lighthearted, funny, beautiful actors, and some interesting fantasy/mythology/supernatural elements. The visuals are breathtaking in some scenes and though it's tropey, if you enjoy that kind of thing it's compelling and entertaining. The pacing in the first half moves quickly, with the characters are introduced well, a couple of different plotlines and personal stakes established, an engaging romance, and it felt well balanced and bingeable.Unfortunately the good parts started to slowly fall away in the second half of the drama, when the character development took a back seat to more murder mystery / crime solving exposition. It just felt like the focus shifted too much and it became a bit boring and hard to finish. It was still worth a watch even if it was underwhelming at the end, because I did enjoy myself for most of it.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

I would recommend to anyone whether you be a fan of kdrama or not.. it got Action , Suspense, mystery and a lot more to make it such a good series..
I'm like a bit of an Anime guy so I'd say this is like the upcoming attack on titan of Anime..
It's a really great show.And I'd say if you're someone not into Kdrama at all.. this could be your first and I honestly promise you that you will not regret it..

tt29569035,"7/10 is my rating. This is a 2023/2024 South Korean supernatural romance drama with 16, 67 (average) minute episodes.First I provide a unique synopsis then reviewSynopsisDo Do Hee (Kim You Jung) is the adopted daughter and heir apparent to a conglomerate company called the ""Future Group"". She is known as a devilish, hard hitting, and ""take no prisoners"" executive who has won many awards. Her adopted mother, Joo Chun Sook (Kim Hae Sook) made it clear, when she was alive, that Do Hee would take over after she passed. This does not endear Do Hee to Chun Sook's children who consider it their right to inherit all of their mother's assets. The obvious solution to some of them is to get rid of the problem. In this case the problem is Do Hee. When a serial killer is hired to kill Do Hee, he nearly succeeds until Jung Koo Won (Song Kang) appears in his role as a Demon who strikes deals with mortals by granting wishings in return for their trip to Hell 10 years later. He originally plans to only save Do Hee if she enters into an agreement but then agrees to save her and then talk about the agreement. In the chaos that follows they both wind up nearly drowning and the tattoo that gives Koo Won his supernatural powers, transfers to Do Hee. Koo Won finds that he can still perform his role and have access to his power by holding Do Hee's wrist where the tattoo is located. When Jun Sook tragically dies a condition of inheriting the business is Do Hee must marry within a year. Koo Won agrees to a contract marriage for mutual benefit, he needs to be close to her to touch her tattoo and she needs a husband to secure her inheritance. The two have twisted fate in the present, but things get even more fate based when it appears they also had a connection in the past.ReviewWhen I looked at reviews there seemed to be those that really loved this series but there was a near equal number that did not like it well. I am in the ""did not like it well"" camp. I think it is worth watching for the two talented actors, great chemistry and interesting premise if you can relax your expectations for a sensible plot. I was actually bored at times because the progress would hit a stall. I would recommend drama fans watch it once but I wouldn't rush out to watch it.SpoilersI have seen hundreds of dramas at this point and that could be why I am among those that found this one very underwhelming. The main couple got together too early in my opinion. Then was no sense of anticipation. It did not make sense to me that she was so driven and determined to be the heir and then she just gave it up. I know they were trying for the ""anything for love"" angle, that she was willing to give up all the power and money to protect herself and the person she loved but it was out of character in my opinion.The serial killer bad guy who was hunting her died too early. I was wondering what they were going to have happen next. It was just odd to have that particular bad guy gone so early in the story.Two very annoying things in this one. Usually you feel somewhat sorry for 2nd girl or guy and I did like second guy but the 2nd girl was one of the most annoying I have experienced to date. They tried hard to gain our sympathy for her in showing how he saved her from abuse but, even that, did not excuse her toxic behavior later. She even tried to get main girl to drink poison so that the main guy, who is a demon who already lived hundreds of years, could live. Although she had hung around him for over a decade and he showed no interest she still blamed main girl for wrecking her chance. What chance? Her jealousy was misplaced and annoying.The other annoying thing was the romance between the elder couple. It was fine they liked each other, even cute, but them hiding it for so long became ridiculous. I think it was supposed to be funny and they definitely did the big reveal where they thought they were hiding it but everyone already knew. Oh ha ha! Like we have never seen that play out before. It was unoriginal and just not funny.When Netflix gets ahold of something I know it is going to be drawn out too much and there will be way too many flashbacks. That was the case in this one. The plot would already be dragging because so many of the major conflicts and reveals already happened and then, oh great, let's rehash the whole script again.They, of course, had to do the separating from you for your own good trope. I don't like that trope. It is right up there with the amnesia trope for me.I believe it was confirmed the leads were dating in real life and they definitely had that level of chemistry. It is not their fault the script was just awful at some points. Their acting was excellent but the content was off.There was so much potential in this one. With a great cast and interesting premise this could have been a great addition to the supernatural genre. I am not sure how they managed to make it so drawn out and boring except the pacing and when they chose to do reveals.#MyDemon#SongKang#KimYouJung#KimHaeSook.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt29569035,"If this was a Hollywood drama everyone would say it's hot garbage, the only reason it gets a pass is because it's Korean.I watched it with my girlfriend, for her, because I know she loves these things, but man, every single episode I found myself questioning my very existence and counting the seconds until it ended, 1 hour felt like an entire evening. We still have 3 episodes to go and I don't know how I am going to make it.The intro song is super catchy and that's why I gave this a 4 instead of a 1/10. I love the beginning of each episode and everytime it ends and I know I have an hour to go, I cry inside.This series does not know what it wants to be, a love story, a depressing tale about death and suicide, a fantasy, an action movie, a thriller, and everything in between. The series tries everything and does nothing right. There are so many plot holes and so many convenient/unrealistic things that happen for the sake of moving on with the plot. It's dragged on, and on, and on, without anything interesting happening.I have no idea who the audience for this literal garbage is but if it works it works.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

And, oh, there's The Glory this year, which was a hit but I haven't seen yet. It's not that it ain't good; it's just that I'm not into bullying-type drama or steamy scenes. Thankfully, I found My Demon on Netflix before the end of the year, and it got me hooked up and well-seated for the entire episode. It has all types of drama in one, which is very rare. It's amazing how every episode has something to it, like a mystery that I wanted to unlock. It's not your typical rom-com, nor would it just fall into the thriller or fantasy category, but it will serve you everything you look for in a drama. It's very interesting and entertaining. I laughed the whole time watching it; I was amazed by the beauty of the cinematography; I got mesmerized by the actors chemistry; I fell in love with their past; I got thrilled with some of the episodes and also made me cry a river.

It's a feel good fun and enjoyable drama, even the hard to watch scenes are still okay to watch. Because My Demon was a Perfect Demon until his powers were transferred to the FL. But what made it so fun too was after he lost his powers and the scenes where he attempt to do something but he kept saving her during the time his powers were transferred to FL. He would show up every time to save her. And that is how they really fell in love. I have watched 10 episodes as they aired and it has been fun fun all the way through, ofcourse there are serious times and issues to deal with but you will laugh more and cry less. One of my favorite scenes is when the ML intro in the series his visuals was no joke. His hair had a wet look and the front just dangled down on his forehead. That was very pretty so props to the hair & makeup team.A Little Spoiler Alert! Some of My Fav lines I will never forget:
The entire series has some amazing lines that you will never forget like ""Because you are the reason of my symptoms"", ""I am my Bodyguard's Bodyguard"", "" Guwon, my salvation"". "" You will be a perfect Demon"". And lots more!Don't pay attention to the poor ratings. That is what they do to bring down a greatly made series.

tt29569035,"Great actors can't save everything. A wonderful Kim Yoo Jung, who, although young, has acting in her blood since she was a child actor, does everything she can in the conditions of a story full of holes and unsuccessful advertising. Even for the fantasy genre, the script and direction are too bad. Guiding the supporting actors to exaggerate is a big directing mistake, given that it's about people in costume, not peasants. The story is far too long, sickly obsessed with Christmas, Christmas on repeat, Christmas leftovers, torture and food. Average special effects, which would have been successful, if there were not so many statics and replays. Material of 8 episodes, extended to 16 episodes.

You could've added more demons in the show if that's what the protagonist is. You could've given him rivals, Achilles heels, etc. Eye candy aside which is obviously the entire objective of the show, you need substance which this show lacks.

tt29569035,"Hi, so I'm creating and IMDb account just to say thank you to the team behind this show. This was one of the best shows I have watched in years. I think the writing was terrific. Every detail was thought of. There was not a dry moment. I thought the tango scene so good, I had to watch it 20 times. I loved the ending scene, the highs and the lows, the outfits of the female lead which were not overly cute but more boss workspace oriented. I think this would go down as one of the best kdramas if not one of the best TV series of all time. I am not a movie critic. I am just a casual user so I don't agree with other reviews that claim the plot's not well thought of or pacing was too slow. I think the writer is brilliant and I will watch all future shows of the writer but it also helps that the cast looks pretty. Actors were quite seasoned. I didn't like the previous roles the ML picked up haha so I dreaded watching this one until I did, and then I was hooked because of the acting, direction, and story. Thank you for giving me a good time! I can see you cared about the craft and it's taken years to perfect the skillset.

You can see that there's no awkwardness towards each other when they act, as if they're not acting anymore.The storyline is well-put. There's no wasted frame for misunderstandings. Even the execution of their past life was amazing.

Either the story was divided with something I didn't care, the ending was sad/lacking which spoiled the drama for me or some other factors that would make me not give it 10/10. But my demon gave me all the fixes I wanted in a great story. Some people complained that some tropes that are in this show are overused or copied but I strongly disagree. In my over 150 dramas that I have seen there is ALWAYS something formulaic, it's the structure of kdramas. What sets one or other apart is how they handle it and some do it better than others. Imo my demon is like that to me. And to top it off it does it with oneof the greatest visuals I have ever seen that ALSO has one of the best chemistry. Every week we fell more in love with Gu Won and Do Hee then in the next one we got behind the scenes content from Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung that made us fall even deeper in love.

Though I assume that what becomes always gets more good and bad attencion so some small group of loud people would always jump on a bandwagon to hate. Happens every time. But overall the sucess is so deserved and made me become a fan of Kim Yoo Jung (who I was already familiar with but still not a fan before) and Song Kang (which was an actor I avoided in romances because of his past characters being either done dirty like love alarm or problematically romanticized red flags like nevertheless). I hope those two will work together in the future because the chemistry was so good and effortless and hope Song Kang will go through enlistment smoothly and come back as great as he is to a sucessful career. Also great sucess in Yoo Jung's next endeavour. They both deserve it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The mix of drama, comedy, and romance is great. The cheesiness is delightful, the music is pretty much a supporting character.I was laughing at the utterly childish comedy and bawling my eyes out the next minute at the heart wrenching scenes. I loved the fantasy element - a bit of magic always comes in handy.Now to decide which K-drama to watch next. What could possibly live up to this heartbreaking and heartwarming series! Great all round, I highly recommend.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

We fans were also hoping they will become a real couple not just on-screen because they are really good for each other.

tt29569035,"Main leads need to work on their facial expressions. Delivering the dialogues wide eyed and with ZERO expressions just isn't it.Poor choice of the leads.👎Some of the reasons why I'm dropping this drama:
1) I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Poor choice of the leads. It's just the visuals of the leads that's getting all the hype. Song Kang isn't giving off the 'demon' aura. Would've been better if they went with a more menacing looking male lead.2) The female lead is weak. Easily swayed.3) The acting isn't delivering what it's supposed to. I'm not getting the emotions.4) Cliché 'damsel in distress' storyline.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt29569035,"Entertaining and involving. The demon & his love do such a great job. And none of this would work without them because it sits right on the edge of schmaltz, and the two of them manage to keep it from suicide.The world portrayed has mix of Catholicism, magical powers, reincarnation, and plot twists. I was left feeling the role of Catholicism was being held back against a strong urge to make more of it. Thank goodness for some restraint.It was a fun departure to have ""God"" played by a bag lady, who carefully explains on several occasions that she can guide events and intervene sometimes, but there is a randomness in the evolution of fate, much of it due to the unpredictable behavior of humans, randomness that can surprise her and make her aware of her own limitations.There are many attempts to lighten things up with comedic interjections, mostly way overboard. But one can take them as short digressions from the story's main thrust, which is how the two lovers manage despite adversities and villains of many kinds. And these two actors manage to contain what easily could become a viewer's impatience with long drawn out staring into each others eyes and extended exuberant celebrations of each others company.Altogether a delightful concoction admirable for how well it travels a knife's edge of overdoing things time after time.

Additional awards overall were won and nominations as well. All of this for 2023 and the series wasn't even over yet as the final wasn't even aired until January 20th. This would be my only criticism of the drama as it is also the best Christmas story ever that I have seen and some of the best Christmas scenes were shown after Christmas. I did not deduct any stars for this as I am not sure who is responsible for the timing of the release of the drama or if or why there were delays, but definitely better to end it in 2023 for both the theme and for better opportunities of awards although it didn't affect SBC. Absolutely great special effects, I can see how much work that department must have put into the fantasy part of the drama, great costuming, and make-up of the supporting character - they made him look so evil. Wonderful chemistry and romance between the 2 main leads that you will find rare.#MyDemon

tt29569035,I absolutely love this drama. It has similar plots like a lot of dramas but also different. I love the chemistry between the ML and FL. The intro music is amazing. A demon unwillingly at first ends up falling in love with the FL. The amount of trials they both go through for each other is beautiful yet tragic. Beautiful because it shows they love each other but tragic because of how many times they almost get killed because of each other.

Yes it's a kind of deja vue, but I can say this one had all kinds of styles it had mystery, fantasy, romance but also comedy which I found myself giggling and laughing like a school girl. I loved how depending on a life situation you and anyone would make a deal with a demon if it could turn your life around for the better !. Yes it's all cliche, but I think you will find that in everything from tv series to movies now a days the ideas are often recycled and cliche it's just how the actors deliver it that makes a difference and here they deliver well.

In the bustling world of K-Dramas, ""My Demon"" emerges as a nocturnal treasure, a series so enthralling that it justifies the under-eye circles from countless nights of binge-watching. The show's mastery lies not just in its captivating storyline but in the layered depth of its characters, each with a narrative rich enough to be a standalone tale.From the opening credits to the last haunting echo of its soundtrack, ""My Demon"" wraps viewers in a visual tapestry that stirs the soul. The cinematography is nothing short of a moving painting, with every frame meticulously crafted. The astonishing pictures it paints are vivid and vibrant, contrasting the dark thematic elements of the supernatural with the all-too-human struggles of its characters.The plot weaves through the lives of individuals who find their destinies intertwined with a sinister force that is both a part of them and an external threat. Each episode peels back layers, revealing the complexities of human emotions and the shadows they can cast. The demon, a metaphor for the inner turmoil and the darkness within, challenges the protagonists, pushing them towards growth and self-discovery.What sets ""My Demon"" apart is its ability to balance the supernatural with the relatable. The writers have skillfully curated each character's journey, ensuring that viewers find a piece of themselves in the heartaches, triumphs, and resolutions on screen. The actors deliver these multifaceted roles with a raw intensity that transcends language barriers, drawing audiences into a shared experience of empathy and engagement.""My Demon"" is a K-Drama that transcends its genre, offering a narrative so riveting that surrendering sleep seems a small price to pay.

Personally i'd put 6 maybe 6.5/10 because I am nice that way :) I am not sure what's so attractive of this series (other than Song Kang's perfect abs and beautiful female lead). Character wise, there are other more appealing characters in other Kdramas. I'm definitely more drawn to ""family"" orientated series. The side characters are kind of there for comic relief and that's that. Most kdrama I've watched, they have side characters who have deep connections with the main leads, either family, or chosen family/close friends. I am sorry to say, the female lead is kind of boring for me. I like female characters who have more personality (chaotic, funny). Those kind of female characters I found in Business Proposal, Destined With You, Welcome to Samdal ri, The Good Bad Mother, King the Land (this might be my least fav, but there few moments made me LOL), to name a few.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Song Kang was a little stiff initially, but he significantly improved throughout the episodes. I liked the romance that transcends times, age, social class, and education. I liked that he loved her for over 200 years, and she was always there in his heart. He even forgot her face and name because he couldn't stand the pain of losing her tragically when he was human.

tt29569035,"At first, I was so excited for this drama. The visuals are amazing. They paired two of the most amazing actors. I mean, helllooo, son of netflix. So I was hyped about watching it. The first 3 episodes didn't disappoint, but then, this drama started taking a turn I didn't like. It got slow, too slow. There were points were I was like they should have added more conflict, more essence behind the very cringe and corny plot. 16 episodes and by episode 9, we've discovered the real villain?Instead of focusing on making a great plot with amazing twists like good kdramas actually do, they focused so much on creating humour, turning it into an exaggerated rom-com. It was highly over done and most of the comic relief, easily became boring and unnecessary. Characters started losing their voice and balance because they are trying so hard to achieve comic relief.Now that they've focused only on humour, we have only the cliches to hold the plot. Evil Chaebol family. Dead parents, orphaned girl. Demon ML that becomes her saviour. Psychopath serial killer that has it out for the FL (I swear I'm freaking tired of seeing this particular one).The only unique plot in this movie was the whole ""Arranged Marriage"" idea, which they also pulled off very terribly. The romance feels like child's play, when I believe they should have given us a King The Land standard of romance because of the choice of plot. *shake head* so many, many disappointing things about this drama. So many.And thennn, episode 8 & 9 came with the kiss scene that didn't sit right with me. The flow was terribly off. But I struggled to keep following the movie, thinking it would get better.I was also very curious about what other twist would happen in the movie that would drive the story until episode 16 because everything has already happened and concluded. By right, episode 10 should have been the finale of this drama.Now, there was that big pause before episode 11 was released(a.k.a part 2 of the drama), and I'm telling you, this drama is terrible. Episode 11 was nonsense, a complete waste of time. At a point, I was like what the hell am I watching. Y'all should get serious for once. The scene about Gu won getting back his cross tattoo just didn't, and I absolutely mean it, didn't make sense.They shouldn't have produced this. I'm angry that this would spoil the great work kdramas did in 2023.I can't continue watching and tbh, I watch everything, but not this! It's pure boring trash.

Its appeal extends beyond its engaging storyline, offering a much-needed dose of positivity. The chemistry between the leads is exceptional, both on and off-screen, sparking rumors of a real-life connection.Surprisingly, SBS chose not to promote it locally or in Korea, leading to a surge in online viewership on platforms like Netflix and other OTT services.

Even now that it is over, I am still longing for more content about the two of them and their wholesome interactions. Another factor is that the drama incorporates multiple genres, even though it is labelled 'Romantic TV Comedies', the series showcases much more than that. From drama to comedy, suspense to romance, historical to fantasy - the series is all that you need to brighten up your day. What's even better is that they also include multiple tropes such as enemies to lovers, bodyguard to lovers, past life lovers, fake relationship, forced proximity, marriage of convenience, amnesia, and workplace romance. Not to forget that the visuals were top tier and on par with the well thought out plot. To think that the crew were able to pull off such a difficult concept is impressive and so worth noting.

No. It is a series with beautiful actors (oh well, really beautiful!!), who know very well how to play.

has roamed the planet for two-hundred years. Forming contract deals with the inhabitants of earth to provide worldly benefits in exchange for their souls. The source of his power stems from a tattooed cross located on his wrist. When an incident occurs, the tattoo is transferred to an icy heiress of a conglomerate, Do Do-hee (Kim Yoo-jung) whom he butts head with. They are forced to settle their differences. Ultimately discovering the common ground amongst each other. Song Kang is the reason
I was intrigued to tune into this series. He is one of my favorite actors from South Korea. Yet Jeong Gu-won is a very handsome and cunning character that is anchored by a wooden performance from it's leading man. This was one of his weakest on-screen portrayals and the lack of chemistry with Kim Yoo-jung did not support an otherwise well-crafted storyline. I felt Kim Yoo-jung resonated more with Kim Hae-sook in their mother and daughter relationship. I would have loved to see more screen-time between them because
their charisma was radiating.What truly reeled me in this series was the fascinating lore behind demonology. Human beings have formed blood pacts with demons over the centuries to accumulate worldly gain and demons have originally lived amongst human beings to protect them as their guardians. With viewers witnessing Jeong Gu-won accomplish his full purpose as a protector once he and Do Do-hee grow to love one another. My Demon is a slow burner that becomes fulfilling for those who are patient. The narrative may be formulaic and the overindulgent product placement is laughable. But there is much to appreciate such as the gorgeous imagery from the director of photography, the passionate scriptwriting from Cho Ah-Il who serves delicious character-development and the series concluding in a satisfying manner that is quite endearing for the audience.IG: thecinephilereviews.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt29569035,"The drama is just plain bad and boring, which makes me wonder what's the hype all about.1. Unpopular opinion: Visuals are actually bad, styling sucksStarting with the visuals, because apparently it's the visuals of the main leads that's got everyone going crazy, but I believe somehow the makers have made Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung look bad. Both the actors are very good looking, but in the series, their styling actually makes them look not good at all. I especially hated Song Kang's hair, they ruined it and it doesn't suit him. His costumes aren't great either, it's manageable to look at. They did Kim Yoo Jung dirty with the wardrobe, it doesn't suit her whatsoever. Overall, the wardrobe and styling seems to have tried so hard to achieve perfection that it fell flat and came out looking pretentious.2. StorylineI couldn't get through the whole drama, and watched only 8 episodes, that too with fast forwarding. It's very badly written, there are glaring plot holes and the story seems all over the place. It seems pretty much very cliched with the whole damsel in distress narrative for the female lead who's supposed to be a very strong individual. There are no stand out dialogues, or compelling narratives, which would hold viewers emotions or their attention. Our boy Song Kang is supposed to be a demon, a bad boy, he doesn't give the vibe whatsoever. Kim Yoo Jung looks awkward in the role of an adult and it isn't convincing.3. Bad actingDon't know if the bad acting by the two very promising leads is due to a bad script or just that they didn't put in any effort. But the acting is emotionless, expressionless. It's not sad where it is supposed to be, it is not affectionate or romantic either. I don't see why people are saying the leads have good chemistry, I really couldn't see anything there. I guess they are just staring into each other's eyes for very very uncomfortably long to make up for chemistry. The comedic acting is good though, the only bearable few minutes here and there during the whole series.I will end my rant now.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

One of plots is virtually identical to Destined To You.

That's not good at all.Therefore, I must separate between talking about the movie quality itself and that problem of hidden message. I enjoyed watching the film as an entertainment, one fantastic Korean series, no doubt why it is so popular. It is a well-done work with many elements fall into places just perfectly right.Nevertheless, I don't think it's right to make the audience see that the demons are those who work for God, because in reality they aren't. They are always against God. It's quite dangerous to view lightly the concept of making a pact with a demon because that is the very worst thing a person can do to himself or herself. And to create such a good-looking and charming demon who is always a hero to our female main character might make some people who don't know the truth of what demons are become interested and want to get to know one. And lastly, God was shown without much respect in this film. God seems to be one who doesn't really care, like to make bets with people and like to gamble, and always blame most bad things on Earth to human. I just don't think that a true Christian would be happy if they watch it to that part.But I'm not saying that the film is a downright blasphemy. It has its own idea about things, but it's just not nice to play with a concept of one's religion this way.One of the main reason I decided to watch this series is that Song Kang is my most favorite Korean actor. He did very good job here in the role and I hope to see more of him in the future.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Almost every drama that came out in 2023 has this same exact overused plot. This is truly hurting the global K-drama audience as most of us watch K-Drama for the unique plots and storyline.My Demon obviously has outstanding visuals like Song Kang & Kim Yo Jung but their acting is not going to save the sunken ship this time. Villians in this series operate like AI bots, you already know who and their next move.

Comparing it to other coreean rom-coms it's the most cringe and unfunny I've had watched. The caracther development it's absent, the acting it's pretty basic, nothing happens in a lot of episodes.

Beside the fact the do a lot of publicity scenes that it's take a lot from the drama seriousness. And as Muslim I don't appreciate the way they disdain God. This is an insult to all religions.

The supporting cast was also unable to capture the attendion to the series.Really hated their portrayal of a god who is horribly useless.and a beggar at best.

tt29569035,"I decided to discontinue my viewership of this series upon reaching the ninth episode, primarily due to the lack of a coherent storyline. It became apparent that the creators were banking on the visual appeal of the actors to captivate the audience, but even with a notably handsome actor, the series failed to overcome its inherent dullness. This sense of dissatisfaction resonates similarly with ""King The Land,"" as its narrative failed to captivate me despite the flawless performances delivered by the cast.As I reflect on my viewing experience, the absence of a compelling storyline in the series became increasingly evident, ultimately contributing to my decision to stop watching. The progression of the narrative up to the ninth episode left me perplexed, struggling to discern a coherent direction or purpose. The reliance on the actors' physical attributes to sustain viewer interest was a noticeable but unsuccessful strategy, as the core essence of a gripping plot was missing.Even the presence of a handsome actor, typically considered an asset for viewer engagement, failed to salvage the overall appeal of the series. The shallow reliance on aesthetics, without a substantive and engaging narrative, left the storytelling hollow and unfulfilling. It became apparent that the creators were prioritizing surface-level elements over the crucial foundation of a well-crafted and intriguing plot.While acknowledging the allure of a handsome actor in the series, it underscores the need for a comprehensive and engaging narrative to truly captivate the audience. The mere presence of aesthetically pleasing actors cannot replace the essence of a well-developed and thought-provoking plot. The realization that ""King The Land"" shared this same narrative shortcoming only heightened my disappointment, as it echoed the missed opportunity for two otherwise promising series to leave a lasting impact.In conclusion, my decision to discontinue the series at episode 9 was driven by a profound dissatisfaction with the absence of a compelling storyline. The reliance on actors' appearances as a substitute for a well-crafted narrative proved to be a flawed strategy. This sentiment, echoed in my experience with ""King The Land,"" highlights the importance of prioritizing storytelling depth over superficial elements to create truly captivating and memorable viewing experiences.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Comedy is lame, story is boring, bad direction, bad acting performances and pathetic demon, Overall totally waste of time. This type of drama Korea made so many times that you'll feel like you've watch it all before. Main story line is interesting but they focused on side stories more and that make main story uninteresting. This series maybe made for promotion of products because in every five minutes they show some new products and whenever they don't show new products they promote religion.

There is a bit of subtle humor running through the story and the relationships are touching. The supporting characters are memorable and enjoyable. Love Claudia Kim's struggles with weight and how her story was resolved. The young girl's story and mind reading is watchable too. Standout young actor and actress. The relationship of the old couple is like some married couples I know.The series however was weakest with the main couple. His time travel got out of hand and impossible to resolve. So in the end the writer gave us a happy ending in that the kid brought him back but couldn't explain why he couldn't come back himself and where he was for so long. Writers in some shows including this one get themselves into a corner with their obstacles and cannot write a proper conclusion so that was ultimately unsatisfying.Chun Woo Hee is pretty from some angles and her hard edge helps her character with the scam artist part at first but hurts the romance part. Didn't feel the love. Jang Ki Yong gives a passionate performance in a quirky difficult role but his hair and clothes are unnecessarily awful even for a depressed character.This show is worth watching because it's different and original if only the end was written in a better more complete manner.,neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

tt32166552,"This series has a sophisticated, atmospheric magic blended with real life traumas and believable characters. People in the drama are flawed, but relatable and likeable.In ""The Atypical Family"" story as well as character development expands with an atmosphere - the colour tones, the music scores as well as sound design, and the easily flowing caesural pauses allowing the viewers to take in the vastness of the scene settings, the seriousness of the situations. One could almost compare this drama to a poetry. Actors and their characters are allowed pauses to think, not to say that they're slow, on the contrary, it makes them and their choices more believable.The script and most chosen actors are spectacular in their roles. The characters are written as smart, thinking, conniving ones, not by making others extremely dull and stupid, but by letting them make smart decisions, allowing them to have multiple purposes. Not a single person here is B&W, they all have their own personal colour pallets.For now (6th episode) I could name only one major drawback - the ML's sister. Her character is overweight, but acted by a slim actress, which makes her movements and mannerisms not genuine and weird.All in all I find the story refreshing and interesting, the clashing of one dysfunctional family with a fake united one, the deadpan comedy, the pain of trauma and not managing to let go of the past.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The other ""family"" is a gang of scam artists led by Baek Il-Hong, enforcer Noh Hyeong-Tae, assistant Grace Kang, and our heroine Do Da-hae. The mainspring of the tale is the relation between Gwi-ju and Da-hae. At first they are distant but ultimately in love.The Bok family has superpowers. Mother Man-Heum has dreams that reveal aspects of the future, which made the Bok family rich by using foreknowledge to buy lottery tickets and stocks in the present that they knew would be winners in the future. The daughter Dong-hee can fly, an occasionally useful ability. The son, our protagonist Gwi-ju, can travel backwards in time. His daughter I-na can read minds.At the beginning of our tale, the Bok family has lost use of their powers. The mother cannot sleep and has no dreams, the daughter is too heavy from overeating to fly, the son is too depressed to time travel, and his daughter I-na is keeping her mind reading under wraps because she finds what people think to be disturbing.And the gang of scammers has identified that the Boks are malfunctioning and decide they can scam the family and get rich. To implement their scam they get our heroine Da-hae accepted as help into the Bok family, where the Bok family finds her to be an antidote to their despondency. She becomes key to the Boks' recovery from anarchy.That is the set up, and the rest of the tale is the uneven progress of the two families and the evolution of the feelings between Gwi-ju and Da-hae.The acting here is convincing, and there are many heartfelt moments that keep things going. So I was engaged. But I found the story confusing because it keeps shifting gears. The role of the superpowers keeps changing, so their uses are disconcertingly redefined as things move along.At first the mother's dreams predict the future. Later they are only suggestive of the future. At first the son can travel backward in time, but only as an observer. Later he can bring information from the present back with him to earlier times, where that information can be made use of to change the present when it arrives.The other confusion which is at the basis of the tale is that Gwi-ju is determined to travel backwards in time to long years ago to save Da-hae when she was trapped in a fire when very young. Why that was necessary is unclear because, as Da-hae points out to Gwi-ju, here she is in the present, so obviously she was saved from the long-ago fire.Suddenly the plot changes and the fire is now, or is it? And Gwi-ju is killed in the fire. Or was he?By and large the story is engaging. The actors do well. But the trajectory of the tale is erratic and seems to rewrite the plot capriciously time and again.

tt32166552,"TLDR; 10/10 unique, time-traveling, fantasy plot with stunning music, cinematography, and acting. Pacing is quick and you never feel bored. Main couple has me kicking my feet and giggling, while crying at the same time. Probably one of my favorite kdramas of all time.Highly underrated. Whoever gave this series a bad review clearly didn't bother to watch past the 1st episode. This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review for a kdrama in my life. I think it's because something about this series makes me strangely emotional even though it's not necessarily a sad story? This series brings me a lot of happiness.Initially the unique plot made me interested in starting it, but the pacing of the story, the characters, and chemistry of the main couple got me absolutely hooked.The casting is immaculate, I've never watched Jang Kiyong's older projects before as the plots never really interested me and I knew Chun Woohee was known for her film acting, but both were rather new to me. But wow, the emotional scenes hit hard. Chun Woohee's acting makes me choke up and the music!!! The OSTs in this series is magical and along with the cinematography it immerses me in the scene and the emotions. The chemistry of the main couple is too good and the romance is well-developed. I love how the writers take their time, but by no means does anything ever feel slow.I love all the characters in this story. Every character has their own color and somehow remains likeable to me despite their flaws (even the loan shark lady!).

tt32166552,"It's hard to believe a story about a family with superpowers could be so boring. With a couple of exceptions:What I liked:1. The special effects were good. Don't want to give it away, so I won't mention specifics.2. I really liked Bok Dong-hee, Gwi-ju's sister. She was hilarious and charming.3. The father, Oh Man-seok, also plays the dad in SOMETHING ABOUT THE RAIN.One of the reasons I like Oh Man-seok, other than his eternally cheerful demeanor, is because he's one of the few Korean actors in a major series with less than a lily-white complexion. Hey, Netflix, how about more brown-skinned Asian actors in your series? Thanks.4. A great, satisfying ending.What I didn't like:1. My main problem is that this series lacks any logical coherence. Why is there an elaborate wedding--with no guests--mind you, when A) the groom didn't actually propose, and B) the bride never accepted the non-proposal? Did either of these two ever say ""I love you""? Did I miss something? This is the stiffest, least-convincing marriage ceremony I've ever seen.And each person in the family is aware that the marriage is a fraud, and an attempt to steal their money. And everybody goes along with it. Really?2. Then there's the matter of the brother, Gwi-ju, who apparently needs to ""save"" someone. While at first, Gwi-ju is out to ""save"" a dude that he worked with, suddenly the target of his obsession changes.He's now set on ""saving"" Do Da-hae, a woman who's moved into the house under suspicious circumstances.But as Ms. Do points out to Gwi--ju, in a rare display of logical thinking--rare for this series anyway, she actually doesn't need saving as she's a healthy, fully functioning woman. Therefore she must have survived whatever horrible, no good, very bad thing happened to her in the past. You know, that thing that Gwi-ju has a bee in his bonnet about.3. Firemen don't stand around giving speeches to someone they're trying to save while the building's going down-but someone does that in this drama.4. The actress who plays Gwi-ju's daughter is adorable, but the romance between the character she plays and the most popular boy in the school is, well, hard to believe. This is middle school, folks.TO BE CONTINUED...
*************
Later: This series is so illogical it's impossible to suspend belief or care about anyone in this family. A couple of questions:4. What exactly are the rules for Bok Gwi-joo's superpower? At first, he can only revisit times when he was happy-until Do Da-hae enters the picture. Then the rule changes: he can only revisit happy times when he was with her. But then the rule changes again-he goes back to a happy moment he shared with his classmates, without Do Da-hae. Then it changes again, he watches a happy moment between his mom and dad-but wait! A very young Do Da-hae rides by on her bike. Whaaa?It sure feels like the writers made it all up as they went along.5. What side of his neck is Bok Gwi-joo's mark on? Is it on the left? Is it on the right? On both sides? ""They say it will never go away."" Who said that? I don't remember anyone consulting a doctor.6. Are we to believe that certain characters go about setting up an elaborate bogus accident in the middle of the day on a well-traveled coastal road-and nobody sees them? No cars, bikes, or pedestrians?The ending made up for a lot...but, but, but...why couldn't Mr. Time Travel come back on his own recognizance?

The plot, pacing and characters were inconsistent but I couldn't stop watching and I'm glad I stayed until the end. It's very much a character driven show and I think the writers wanted a gradual process of character development instead of it seeming to come out of left field, which I appreciate. However, I also couldn't help but pity Bok I-na because her father couldn't change for her, as he was only motivated to change himself after meeting Do Da-hae. Like it was sad! But I was glad that Do Da-hae kept pushing him to think about his family. My favourite thing about this show wasn't even the romance. In fact it was the unlikely friendship between Bok Dong-hee and Grace. They were so funny and I really liked their interactions.

This drama presents superpowers in a refreshing way, diverging from typical portrayals. It delves into mental health, socio-economic challenges, family dynamics, relationships, and the concept of destiny, exploring how we perceive and respond to it.Despite mixed reviews, I guarantee that those who dislike this drama likely don't grasp its essence. It's not for fans of conventional romance dramas, love triangles, wealth struggles, or standard fantasy plots. Instead, it caters to viewers who enjoy time travel, fantasy, power dynamics, and time paradoxes. If you have the mental acuity to understand its intricate plot, you'll appreciate the genius behind its writing. This drama is rewatchable, packed with easter eggs and details that spark engaging theories and discussions. Criticism that it ""doesn't make sense"" often stems from a lack of understanding, not a flaw in the drama itself. It simply isn't aimed at those seeking mainstream narratives.In essence, this drama is simple, relaxing, and fun. It boldly portrays an unconventional family, a deeply depressed male lead, and a female lead who is a cheat, defying typical sad drama tropes.

Honestly, it took about 4 episodes before the dramatic undertow broke down my ""you've got to be kidding me"" barriers.Bottom line is it's not a show for a k-drama beginner.: It would tigger too much crazy-making culture shock. But once you've seen a lot of k-dramas, you get used to a lot of really strange stuff. Like how a tiny 12 yr. Old girl, who seems to be legally blind without her glasses, is allowed to walk to school (and all over the whole darn city) ALONE.But if you can get past the clueless child neglect, ""Atypical Family"" might just pull you in like it did me. Btw, This is maybe a 7 star series, but I gave a full extra star for the top-notch performance of Jang Ki-yong, who plays time travelling Gwi-joo. His character slowly sheds his comatose stone-coldness, frays and unravels, then unleashes a range of nuanced and cagey emotions. Jang's 4D acting definitely unveils itself as a cut above his costars, whose emotive capacities are either borderline passive, over-the-top, comic-bookish or just blah. (The actress who plays Grace deserves a small shout-out too. She's a cool combo of sly and fierce.) Anyway since the whole super-power thing was slow getting started, maybe we get a cliff hanger and a Season 2? I Hope so.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Her son Gwi Ju jumps off from a cliff and power does not return. Does Da Hae comes in for the rescue?

Interaction with normal humans does not help them. Then what is it to build their power again...Highs of the drama:

This 12-episode drama deftly avoids the usual pitfalls of drawn-out storyline and unnecessary side plots.Let's talk plot: Depression, obesity, insomnia-yup, they hit our heroes too. Who knew superheroes could be so... relatable? Gwi-ju's time-hopping adventures are a visual treat, thanks to some killer color grading. The past and future twist together in a way that makes time feel like a playground, showing us destiny isn't set in stone. And that chemistry between the leads? Pure, swoon-worthy magic. Real, raw, and refreshingly natural.The background score? An absolute vibe. Soothing, calming, and hitting all the right notes to tug at your heartstrings. But let's get real: Gwi-ju's haircut? Total misfire - Post-depression makeover? Nonexistent. I mean, I've got love for him, but - Do Da-Hae stole the spotlight in this one. She's the real MVP of the show, hands down.Skipping the whole ""we met as kids'' cliché would've been nice, though the show handled it better than most. The final scene where Do Da-Hae doesn't move away from a falling wall? I get you but girllll, you've got a kid to protect! Well, every drama has its hiccups.Watching Do Da Hae's family morph from shady to shiny is pure character development gold. No real villains here, just complex people getting their acts together. Ji-Han causing chaos? Again just an accidental anti-hero.I-Na growing up? Acknowledged without the unnecessary makeover.

tt32166552,"My 1st review for iMDB b/c I was so struck by this show.This show takes some common character archetypes but gives them surprising twists: a rich family of people with superpowers, but instead of running wild with using their superpowers for happiness, each is profoundly tortured and broken by them; a scheming gold-digging con-artist who is paralyzed by her real affection for her victim; the predator is actually a past victim. Nothing is as it seems because each character is used to show us the touching, human side of each character.Similarly, each plot twist is not what is expected, and the viewer is constantly surprised by each successive beautiful facet of each character that is slowly revealed as the show progresses.I must admit I wasn't sure I'd continue the show after the first episode. However, with each episode, the viewer gets pulled deeper into the twists and turns that have you rooting for every character, even the villains.I won't give any spoilers because each twist and turn, each layer of the onion that is peeled away reveals a beautiful humanness that is such a pleasure to watch, and I don't want to rob the viewer of the joy each episode brings.Even when I expected the last episode to be a cliché wrap up of the show that simply ties up all the loose ends in a boring, pro forma conclusion, the show keeps turning out new twists that make even the end a surprise,A warm-hearted show that made me sad that it ended because it was so good.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The chemistry between the main couple is so amazing, and I literally could not put down the drama at some parts because I was so invested in the plot.

The plot centers on, if we really are to believe it, the endemically CORRUPT upper echelons of S. Korean society. Is it a coincidence that many of the systemic abuses of power and institutional vice that constitute Vincenzo's Main Plot are now also going on, this very moment in the USA? It is certainly food for thought. A clear advantage this Korean drama has over mediocre US shows, however is a much softer-handed use of violence, resorting more often to satire to keep the plot moving as opposed to gratuitous savagery now so common in so-called ""hit"" US shows.

I won't spoil anything, but I'll give my thought on some of the different aspects of the show.The story (10/10):This show grabbed a hold of me within the first minutes. The beginning really set the atmosphere and painted the main character as a cold, calculated and mysterious person. I mean; who does not like a beginning that glues you to the screen right away. I have to be honest and say that I binged the whole show in a week due to the never ending captivity of Vincenzo and the story that unfolds around him. I'm hope I'm not biased, but this show had me from start to finish and for that I have to give the story, a top rating.The characters: (10/10)
As the show goes on, we get to know all the different characters, their personas, their believes and what their values are. All the characters are great and gives the show a perfect balance of excitement, comedy and sadness. I can honestly say that I was just as interested in Vincenzo as I was in the other characters. They all had their story unfold like a present thought out the show.The protagonists were great, the antagonists were very good and all the other side-characters were interesting. What more can you ask for?The music: (10/10)There is nothing more to say than ""Bellissimo!"" The music was used in a perfect manner, the choice of songs at certain moments were spot on and they really gave the show a good feeling of Italian and Korean. Much respect the the people who worked on the music for this show.This might seem like a very biased review, but I still can't shake the feeling I'm left with, now that I've finished the show. I want to watch it again! I want to experience the opening sequence, I want to hear the music and I want to see how it ends all over again! Brilliant show! Just brilliant! If you haven't watched it, then do it! I promise you won't regret it. I laughed, I cringed, I cried and I enjoyed my way thought this masterpiece!

The first few episodes need a bit of time to shake out, but when they get going, it's wonderful. Favorite scene to date--the corrupt judge who is stung by hornets in his classroom.

tt13433812,"I'm not sure how many times I have to repeat myself. I'm a writer of eight novels, and one of the most basic elements of writing is that you never sacrifice character for the sake of the plot. In other words, you don't make a character do something that goes against the character in order to make the plot work. And writer Park Jae Bum makes a very rookie mistake in Episode 19 that carries over into Episode 20.For the most part, Vincenzo is an impeccable series that is nearly flawless until those terrible 20-25 minutes-the end of Episode 19 and into Episode 20. We are extremely fortunate that this doesn't ruin the series. As I said in the series ""Mad For Each Other,"" if you ruin the ending of a series, you destroy the series itself.Vincenzo is a character on par with Jason Bourne or dare I say it-Batman (the comic character, not the live-action depictions) in which he's like a grandmaster chess player. He's always two or three moves ahead of his enemies. He's also a master of assessing a situation and making the smart choice, not to mention his nearly infallible ability to predict what will happen next based on his enemies' last move.Choi Myung Hee has just arranged for herself to take the fall for Jang Han Seok. Despite the fact that we know why she's doing it, it should be equally obvious to a character like Vincenzo. And yet, neither he nor Hong Cha Young can see the obvious: that it's to get Jang Han Seok out of prison. That was rookie mistake #1 by Park Jae BumJang Han Seok has abducted Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo is purposely brought to Jang Han Seok's house in order to kill him. During the ensuing struggle as Jang Han Seok's brother-Jang Han Seo-jumps him. Rather than helping Jang Han Seo subdue Jang Han Seok-who has a gun-Vincenzo rushes to free Hong Cha Young instead. Vincenzo would never do that. He would realize that the best way to keep Hong Cha Young's safety-as well as Jang Han Seo-is to help Jang Han Seo take out Jang Han Seok. Now, if in the ensuing struggle, Jang Han Seok manages to escape, that's all right. But I sighed with disgust when Vincenzo rushes over to Hong Cha Young instead. He would know that the best way to protect her would be to disable and take out Jang Han Seok. That was awful. And again, it's something Vincenzo would never do. It goes against the intelligence and nature of the character himself.Things briefly go from bad to worse as Vincenzo, who is now tending to the wounded Hong Cha Young, is literally watching the two brothers struggle with the gun-and only a few feet away-he still doesn't rush to help Jang Han Seo. He sits and watches. Again, I was rolling my eyes with disgust at how ridiculous the entire scenario played out. It was obvious that they wanted Jang Han Seok to escape to set up the showdown for the rest of Episode 20.As I said, the series was running smoothly, for the most part. Aside from some inconsistencies from the residents of the plaza and their fighting abilities as they go from an inability to fight to suddenly being experts, even though the so-called boxing winner can't even throw a punch mirroring an actual boxer (a true boxer would know how!) the series runs like a fine oiled machine.One more small issue--which most movies and shows take extreme liberties--is moving the gold bars. We see the bars being put into a piano, taken around in pockets and bags, sometimes 3-4 bars at a time. Gold bars weigh over 27 pounds each! (12.4 kilograms). While it made for some funny moments, it was highly unrealistic.It's difficult to pen down the actual genre of this series, which often plays out like a black comedy and then transitions into a drama-thriller and then back again. I've marveled at the Koreans' ability to fluctuate and do it seamlessly. It speaks to the genius of their writers, despite Park Jae Bum's lapse in judgment and writing ability.Vincenzo is a Korean-Italian consigliere-essentially one of the highest ranks in the mafia aside from the head man himself. He makes no apologies for his methods of dealing with those who would prey upon the weak and the helpless, and he brings his own sense of ""justice"" to bear against anyone-from lowly thugs to those sitting in power, bathed in corruption. Little do these people in power know who or what they are up against, nor do they realize what Vincenzo is capable of until it's too late. It's like watching very good chess players who think they can hold their own-finally meeting their match against a grandmaster. Vincenzo easily exposes their inabilities, and they find out soon enough that Vincenzo isn't someone who makes idle threats. He means to do exactly what he says he'll do. Jang Han Seok and his nasty den of lieutenants look at Vincenzo and laugh as though he's just some character in a movie. But he outplays them and outdoes them at every turn.""24""'s Jack Bauer-a special field agent for the Counter-terrorist unit once tells a panel of senators, ""It's sad that we live in a world where someone like me is necessary to do what needs to be done."" Vincenzo is of the same ilk. The higher-ups in corporations and political machinations believe they are all but untouchable and that they can do whatever they want. Someone like Vincenzo is able to prove to them just how wrong they are. But it also takes someone like Vincenzo to deal with them in complete and unforgiving ways.I have always marveled at characters who are smart. I love Jason Bourne because of his ability to outthink his opponents. Batman is the same. And Vincenzo has those same qualities. Oh, he can fight and hold his own, but it's his wits that make him formidable and such an iconic character. Song Joong Ki masterfully plays Vincenzo-who at times-seems light and almost playful, and other times as an absolutely scary opponent you would never dare cross if you understood him and what he's capable of doing. He doesn't play Vincenzo as a simple thug. And despite his background, Vincenzo becomes attached to the people of the plaza and will do whatever it takes to protect them. He calls himself a ""villain"" and yes, he often comes across that way, but he's essentially a good man who simply finds himself using terrible methods to get the job done. Much like Jack Bauer, as I stated above.The entire cast was nothing short of fantastic, and if it had not been for the major letdown of those 20-25 minutes, this series would have easily been a ""10"" for me. But, alas, those minutes put a big dent into a story that was running along so smoothly and so effortlessly. It's just too bad that the ball was dropped temporarily. Still, it doesn't torpedo the series, and it's definitely worth a look. It's not as great or as tautly written as ""My Name"" or ""Stranger"" but it's most certainly good enough.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"From the very first episodes, it's easy to find the story, plot work, pacing,... was all done perfectly. From how Vincenzo is introduced (I hate how unrealistic the fire spread though) to the schemes, how strong Babel is build as an unpenetratable image.. All could've been something more than this. Yet it might've been this brilliant style which killed the show.First of all: Everything was done perfectly right-on-time like a 2nd grade fomula. Yes good pacing can sometime do great, like how it hyped people's feelin when Joon Woo show off his identity (uwu gud stuff). But what's unforgivetable is how it breaks the beautiful setting that this show provided. We all know lucky moments and coincidences are sometime acceptable as it's reasonable to happen and will only make the scenes more awesome. But bruh not in this case, bc they freakin spammed it! The amount of oopsie moments that were created only for the shake of helping the protagonist and his companions are immesurable. Remember how Vincenzo and plaza owner closed the shelter's door right on time in ep ? Or when he arrive just b4 main girl of the show have her face punched? These little but ugly details totally ruined my experience as it's bland out unrealistic.Secondly: Weak character building followed up by weak script. Seriously, Paolo the gangster boss is nothing but a bullied child who dare do nothing, even can't take revenge on Vincenzo's driver when his master is abroad. And I was totally dissapointed seeing how Vincenzo easily kidnapped, tortured, got information from frankly any bad guys. It's like his aura of a normal build little baby face man and some weak measures of suffering could scare the f*ck out of everyone. Not to say no guard or security plan is effective against a korean mafia boy who works alone to invade Babel's domain and employees. Also, the poducers liked to spam backup saveboats that litterally turns the tide of the show. Oh Vincenzo is in trouble? Don't worry, he's rich and knows martial art at a superior rate! Oh plaza civilians are in danger? Don't care cause all of them know how to fight, and some are even masters of brawls. And you won't need me to speak out loud how trashy nerfed Ant Company was, right? (Although I hate it when the members of goverment and important people keep showing up to help willingly for no particular reason more)
Hmm, at this rate I think further criticism is unnecessary as you may've all now capable of looking at that overrated mess called Binsenjo Cassanova with a more precise perspective. For me myself, well the only reason I watched it to the end is 'cause of Joon Woo's actin, plot and role (as it's acted brilliantly with some manners of being the most realisticccc and No.1 part of the whole show uwu)

tt13433812,"I've watched Vincenzo until ep.18 (out of 20), so I guess it's already acceptable for me to write a review. My feeling about this series : unfortunately, really really disappointed.The reason why I watched this series is because I was intrigued by the genre : a mixture between politic, thriller, action, and comedy. The first few episodes are quite fun. But that fun only last for approximately the first 10 episodes. Even in the first 10 episodes, I already found several issues that bothered me. For example, why is Cha-Young fighting against her dad in the first place? There's no backstory whatsoever about why she chose to work in Woosang despite how corrupted Woosang is (only for the money? I dunno). Then, there's Myung-Hee. What is her motive? What is the reason for her total support for Han-Seok despite their constant losing? Is she just downright 'evil'? And for Han Seok, I just can't believe the writer just explained his character as a psychopath. Don't tell me that this is not a lazy way to create an antagonist character.What annoyed me the most is actually what she and Han Seok keep on doing every single episode : an empty threat ""You'll regret it"", ""What if I kill you first?"" blah blah. Their method of winning is apparently : A doesn't want to cooperate? Kill A. B knows something he/she shouldn't? Kill B. C is acting annoying? Kill C.But of course Vincenzo will always outsmart them and win. If this only happens for like 2/3 episodes, I won't be so annoyed. But this pattern of handsome-and-perfect main lead that keeps winning against the 'bad guys', no matter how cliché it is (yes, Inzaghi, I see you), for every single episode, is just.. underwhelming.Han Seo is at least a more interesting character than Myung Hee or Han Seok. He shows change : once a shadow for his brother and was always afraid of him, but now finally has courage to fight against him and even becoming wittier.I mean, this series can be great, with a proper storyline. Probably a less perfect Vincenzo that can make mistakes sometimes. Probably a smarter and cunning antagonist that's actually 'do' something instead of just talking big and failed miserably..Don't get me wrong, I love the actors and actress. They saved the show. They saved the poor and lazy story writing. That's why I give the rating of 5 : despite the meh story writing, the CGI of Italy (and Inzaghi apparently) is beautiful and realistic, some of the comedic scene is quite funny, the cinematography is amazing, and the music they choose do compliments the atmosphere.But, in the end, nothing can really save a poor story.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"This show has the best of everything. It has action, comedy, just the right amount of romance, and incredible characters. You even find yourself loving the villain because the actor is that good. Jang Han-Soek and Vincenzo are great because they are both villains. There is no real good guy or bad guy. I'll be looking for other shows these actors are in because I was really blown away. 10/10. Do yourself a favor and watch this show.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

His acting is maturing and gets more seasoned in each progressive show. Dunno how he's got such flawless skin, but definitely a joy to watch.

tt13433812,"While it takes around 3-4 episodes, Vincenzo is undeniably an underrated series that gets overlooked due to the fact it's a K-drama. Although the medium has a reputation for having excessive amount of romance (from what I've heard), Vincenzo is nothing like that, the mild amount of romance does not affect the story in any way.The first 4 episodes are slightly predictable, the rest of the show is a Rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of the seat.The main character of Vincenzo - Vincenzo Cassano is also really great. Well-written, charming and a straight up overpowered badass, he takes on multiple foes using his wit and experience as a mafia accompanied by a great cast of side characters who are equally as likeable.The show touches on the subject of human greed and Vincenzo must deliver Justice while at the same time tries to grow into a more humble person despite his past life.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

I like the plot of how each villain ended. I was shocked of how Vincenzo's character was really dark but I guess it will not make sense if it is not related to Mafia. The supporting characters had each unique contributing roles that came as a surprise. Overall I really liked this kdrama but it I think Joongki's acting can still be improved.

tt13433812,"Korean Drama "" Vincenzo "" had a good concept but there were times that it didn't make it work.The main problem with this drama is the length. It's not only twenty episodes long, each episode also was about an hour and twenty minutes. However, the story was not for that length. Therefore, there were episodes, especially the final ones, when the story was full of fillers, unnecessary twists, and ridiculous situations that were trying too hard to be funny. The blend, though, of action, comedy, and legal themes was an interesting combination that worked for most of the cases. Most of the characters were also pretty interesting, though some of them, like the piano lady and the female lead, were annoying and it was obvious that they were written to be eccentric, but that was presented in a way that screamed try-hard. The villain was a boring character in the second half of the drama. However, it must be noted that the big twist was an innovative one and pretty entertaining.As for the performances, everyone did a great job, especially the male lead who finally found the right character for his proper comeback after the big hit DOTS.So, overall, six out of ten.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

tt13433812,"I often see many K-dramas being overhyped. The audience tends to give perfect 10/10 ratings, making it difficult to find unbiased reviews, seeking a fair evaluation is futile, as everything is hailed as a ""must-see"" and the ""best drama"" of the year.The crime/mafia theme falls short, with the main character failing to convincingly portray a mafia figure, I even find him cringe. Excessive use of plot armor is overwhelming. The ML is depicted as smart character, but when plot armor is needed he suddenly lost his brain.The FL character lacks development. Despite being a supposed top lawyer defending a company that has a lot of dark secrets, she consistently depends on the ML. Her character is no different from a sidekick.The most interesting characters are probably the Jang brothers. Especially Han Seo. However, his death felt cheap. I understand the desire for emotional impact, but it could have been more purposeful. His death didn't contribute to the plot, could have been prevented, and left a gap in the ML's character. Some might argue that it makes him (the ML) human and realistic, but come on... From the first episode until the last, when has his character ever been portrayed as realistic?The show's world-building is almost childish. An intelligence organization fails to notice a mafia member's activities, despite his interference with prominent people. The person investigating him becomes a fan, the agency chief becomes a pawn, even the Interpol is being depicted as joke. The justice system is easily manipulated by ML, making it hard to believe. They didn't success in making him a smart character but rather went ahead and lowered the IQ of his enemies and law enforcement.The only redeeming aspects are good looking people dressing to impress.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

tt13433812,The best part is watching the boyish faced SJK in elegant suits do mafia like things in Korea. I just want to laugh whenever he does his thing. The classical music and opera is well used. The end of each episode is funny and something outrageous usually happens to get you to tune in to the next episode. The first episode was strong with the contrast between how he deals with bad guys in Italy and Korea. Timely nod to Purdue Pharma narcotic issues in episode 3. Episode 4 is quite grand and past things come together.The bad part is subsequently the humour is often painful and the unnecessary overacting of Jeon Yeo Bin is hard to watch. Ok Taecyeon is almost unrecognisable as the goofy intern but his hairstyle changes as he does. Excellent supporting actor Kwak Dong Yeon is a memorable here as a bad guy.I'm still hoping the series will get better and things will get funnier and less painful. They try for jokes when it isn't necessary and it often fails. Even Itaewon Class was funnier and it wasn't mainly a comedy because they reserved jokes for when it counted. Culture clash has the potential for much laughter but it isn't well used. The reactions of the actors are too exaggerated. So many scenes could have been cut.,neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

tt13433812,"8/10 is my rating. This is a 2021 South Korean Action and Crime drama with 20, approximately 80 minute episodes.Park Joo-hyung (Song Joong-ki) grew up in Italy. At eight years old he was adopted and harbors resentment towards his Korean mother who he feels abandoned him. He later becomes part of the Italian mafia and is such an asset the head, Don Fabio, adopts him. As a member of the Cassano family Joo-hyung is renamed Vincenzo Cassano. He becomes a lawyer and utilizes his skill as he works as a representative for his adopted father in mafia dealings. When the father dies, the biological son attempt to kill Vincenzo and, after taking revenge, Vencenzo flees the country back to South Korea.In Seoul, Vincenzo goes to the the Geumga Plaza which is a site where he helped a Chinese tycoon hide 1.5 tons of gold and install tenants to disguise the real intention of the building.The Chinese tycooln is dead, and ownership of the gold now falls to the Cassano family, and Vincenzo plans to recover the gold for himself. Of course, the building has been taken over by a South Korean crime organization in the form of a pharmaceudical company, the Babel group. The Babel group has been strong arming the tenants so Vincenzo decides to team up with one of the tenants, a lawyer, to take down the Babel group. The lawyers daughter, Hong Cha-young (Jeno Yeo-been) was originally represting Babel but after her father is murdered by them, joins up with Vincenzo to exact revenge on the Babel Group. Sparks had originally flown between the two but as they unite toward a common purpose those strong feelings evolve to something more.Overall, I liked this series a lot. All of the actors, and you had a pretty much all star cast with a few exceptions, did an amazing job acting out their characters. The storyline was exciting and the villians were incredibaly villanous. The whole ""it takes a villian to catch a villian"" axiom was true throughout the series. The chemistry between the two leads was not immediate, which made sense to me because they did not start out liking each other but developed a deep friendship through working to take down a common enemy.*Spoilers The pros were the incredible acting, great locations and filming, and appropriate but not too invasive musical scores. Who doesn't love Song Joon-ki in action, he is incredibly handsome and charasmatic. The sense of community with the building tenants was both refreshing and engaging. I loved that Cha-young was a tough, no nonsense lawyer with a bit of a dark streak. It made her the perfect pairing for Vincenzo because she did not have an issue, if justice would not be served, with going outside of the law. I loved that there was gold hidden in the building and how disturbed Vincenzo would get whenever someone would pursue his gold. He reminded me, in those cases, of a Leprechaun guarding his gold. One of the most comedic scenes was when he had to pretend to be gay to lure in a bank that was willing to work with Babel. Whether you are gay trying to be heterosexual or heteresexual tying to be gay if you are engaging the sexuality that does not fit - it is cringy. I was laughing, so hard during that part. The funny thing, was he seemed to turn all the guys around him gay. The men seemed to love him as much as the women did. It was like everyone's dark fantasy, apprently, to be in the mob. So there were bromances galore.The cons were the times that Vincenzo failed to stay true to character. What it seemed, was he was a South Korean child, adopted into the Italian culture but was old enough to remember the language and most of the culture of his original country. His anger at his mother for ""abandoning"" him, and the death of his foster parents through criminal activity, led him to embrace the dark side for revenge. I got that. Made sense. But, it showed, in so many ways that he was very humane and caring and had conscience and could love and all that - not even a sociopath because he wasn't simply ""blending in"" his feelings appeared genuine and he underwent an evolution through meeting and falling in love with Cha-young, being mentored and befriended by her father, and just forming so many friendships in South Korea. But then, his mother, who he was on the precipice of a true reunion with, is murdered and it is like it flipped a switch. He backtracked on all the progress he made and the brutal element fully came back in him. The fact that he had flashbacks and nightmares of past incidents clearly showed that he had remorse to that point. But then it was like he became a slightly different person after his mother's death. I thought the way he killed the Babel villians was just a bridge too far. I cannot reconcile burning someone to death with someone who is a good person. Although the chairman was evil and had done horrible things, drilling someone to death is just the next level of brutality. Becoming as evil as the evil you are punishing does not make you a good person. I was disappointed when he blew up Cha-young's father's killer. He broke his word in my opinion. HHe told him once he did this thing the debt was fulfilled and he could go free. It was dishonest and it seemed even Cha-young felt he had gone too far. But she never said that although her response to the news seemed as if it bothered her.When he killed the female lawyer he broke his morale code which was no women and children. She even said you are going to do this to a woman and he said, basically, you are not a woman, you are a monster. Still, burning her alive was the next level up brutality. It took him from a batman like, superhero justice seeker, to just a murderer little better than the people he was ""punishing"". I also could not buy that the law enforcement friends in his circle were so okay with him brutally murdering those people. They helped him get away with it and even shook hands with and hugged him when he had the blood on him. It was a bit like ""Dexter"" in that dark anti hero type persona but I am just not a fan of that level of ""eye for an eye"" because his treatment of them was even more brutal than the way they treated their victims.The ending also fell short for me. Perhaps they are setting it up for another season. I did not like the very ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" end where he can only come back when on a diplomatic mission (diplomatic immunity). It was over obvious in the postcards he sent that he wanted her to come find him - yet she didn't. To me it seemed as though her emotions toward him took a turn. I did not have the sense she would be willing to leave South Korea and go join him on an island off the coast of Malta. I had no care for his Italian family. We never got to know enough of that piece to care that he had reunited and was now ruling that family. And, we were reminded of his brutality when he mentioned the revenge he took on a rival family and that their remains were fertilizing his grapes. They confessed and kissed but then parted ways with a somewhat sad and whistful look in both of their eyes.His behavior, as other reviewers have pointed out, was not even consistent with what is often the case in organized crime. I knew a situation like that once - one of my best friends in high school let's just say her father was a retired person in a very well known organized criminal entity. In those situations, usually the lawyer is very valuable and also high up in the crime organization. They do not have those folks act as ""hit persons"" they are too valuable to the organization. And they typically have done their dues and don't want to get their hands dirty that way. Not that they have suddenly grown a conscience, but they just don't do the dirty work anymore. So that did not make sense. He was a lawyer and the second in command - the family would typically not risk such an individual by involving them so intimately. Even if he, himself, wanted to be involved, unless there was a compelling reason he would usually be ordered by ""the boss"" not to.That being said - I would still recommend it and might even rewatch it at some point. It is unique and so well acted that the flaws are not a complete deterrant. Others really liked it and did not consider these things flaws. Cha-young had just enough darkness in her to accept a lot of what he did. It was very ""Game of Thrones"" in the darker elements and how most of the characters were not completely good or completely evil but various mixes thereof. And how you were rooting for anti heroes. The ""Queen of Dragons"" in Game of Thrones reminded me of Vincenzo in the way their characters evolved and the sudden switch down a much darker path. But I wasn't a fan of how that ended either. I like redemption and character growth. This followed the opposite trajectory. If there were a second season I might watch it. I am extremely disappointed in the brutality of the murders so I can't think of a way back from that but would be interested to see where their relationship evolved.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"Best kdrama I've ever watched, the performances are good and make me laugh for having good humor, the intelligence of the characters are captivating, the construction of the series was very well elaborated. The jokes are very well used and are not made every 2 minutes, the director and his colleagues knew how to enjoy each episode, I could say that the real president of Babel made an extraordinary revelation and that at no time did I think it would be him, his personality change and the way he showed interest in every moment after the revelation was unique and the actor is to be congratulated for his performance.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"If the comedy isn't for you then fair enough. A comedy will never favour because not everyone has the same humour. However I personally think this show has a perfect balance of thriller, action, comedy and suspense. Those who judge shows after watching 1 episode I think are rather stupid. Obviously you're not gonna fully grasp the characters in episode 1/20...that's why there's more episodes. The acting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography is great, some parts you're not supposed to take seriously because they're for comedic purposes. I love the character development too it's amazing. I also love the storyline and the idea of a Korean - Italian mafia...it's quite interesting. I don't wanna give away too much but at least watch til ep 3-4 til you judge. It's definitely worth watching. I like how the romance between the two leads isn't super cliché and isn't the main focus either but it's still there, it's more of a slow burn romance between them. The action scenes are well shot and quite realistic too. Omg I could go on and on about this show I love it so much.

tt13433812,"It was such a good series to have ended so open.After so many episodes, viewers would have liked to have some type of uplifting ending. So, this is my creation for a more ""fanciful"" ending.After leaving Korea, using the ""one year later"" time jump, Vincenzo - who has a wealth of information on corrupt dealings - has now been given some type of position with Interpol. He goes to the Korean-Italian conference and reunites with Hong Cha Young and they share that ""kiss moment"" under the stars and he leaves, only to return to Geumga Plaza and surprises all the quirky residents for some over the top sentimentality, with each resident having their own astonished encounter with Vincenzo. The Plaza and surrounding area is reborn so the city becomes revitalized thanks to the stash of gold that is being laundered and the funds are used just for that.Hong Cha Young and Vincenzo are married in the Buddhist Temple with the Plaza residents in attendance. They establish a law firm for those who have no political or social voice.In the revitalized building, Inzaghi the pigeon of karma returns to the window with...a family!I'm sure I missed a few other things, but I think viewers would have wanted that uplifting and well-done, tear-jerking finale.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"This is not a fan-friendly review. Although the series is not the best, it is a good series that several chapters can be rescued but not all. At first we are used to very long chapters, a bit empty, they have top moments that hook you but a thread is lost in the critical attention of those who see it. There are chapters that I consider to be really good like some initials and some endings, but 20 chapters are not necessary, chapters that if you skip, you will still understand the plot and you did not miss anything, clearly it is not a piece of art, because it does not have The best photograph is very long, there are characters that do not have nuances, such as the antagonist, who dehumanizes someone only to have feelings of evil, or to hook up with a character who practically only at the end realizes the love he feels for the girl , which we must question because at this point in history it is not healthy to continue having this type of concept about love as a couple. Now, there are chapters that are really good for the nuances of some characters, for the Korean humor, for the impeccability of the script, for the photography of some landscape scenes, for the costumes. But I insist that a maximum of 10 chapters would be good, not 20 because I feel that in addition to saying good, some are not so good but I already invested a considerable time I have to finish it to see the outcome that is anticipated in the acting of the characters from the initial chapters .The development of the relationship between the characters is seen throughout the story, but I question the way a character is idolized in this case a man in the role of savior. In short, it is not a bad criticism but a constructive and obvious one, I love this actor and many of his characters, I like many things about him as an actor and seeing many characters from other series that are still really incredible in their acting roles.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"This is one of the best shows I have watched in a long time. The writing, the casting, the flow, and the crossover between drama and comedy was genius.

tt13433812,"The show has a super handsome hero, perfect in all aspects, good to look at, rich, an attorney, well dressed, and that's just about it. There is nothing else going for the show. The female lead is also an attorney, but she behaves in the most un-lawyerly manner, more like a drama artist who routinely goes over the top when acting. The bounce in her gait had me flinching every time! Not only did she overact, she actually had very little to contribute to the story, no wonder the drama was named just after the male lead. Another headache were the silly tenants, who wasted most of the screen-time allotted to them. No offence to the actors(except the FL, of course), the actors were all good and I've seen a few of them in other shows acting well, perhaps the script written for them was unnecessarily loud and full of too-much-drama. The lead villain was too handsome to be cast in a negative role, and though his role was also written to be an over-the-top excessive one, he did justice to it. I happened to watch this show twice, once by myself and next time with my kids, and the second time I kept wondering why I endured it the first time :)
I cannot stop ranting about the FL though, was she some relative of a producer, and she had to be cast no matter what? If that's the case, it is understandable and my sympathies are with the casting team, but if not, then the casting team needs to really improve their practices, especially when they are casting someone opposite a stalwart like Song Joonki. And I pity Song Joonki for having to put up with the terrible acting of his female co-actor and some other actors, who could have been dropped from the show without making much difference.",negative,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

So what if she likes money, everybody does that.Speaking about the plot, well what do you know full of twists and turns till Ep 4 atleast. To be honest some things are predictable but still you can't create everything a new.",positive,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
tt13433812,"I initially went into this drama not really sure what to expect, but hopeful to see how the plot of a K-drama would deal with a mafia element.For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed myself while watching the show, it really didn't begin to feel like it started to drag on until the last couple of episodes. I really did enjoy a lot of elements, but there were also some things I felt like could have used some work.PROS:
-- The acting was quite good, specifically (for me) the main villains Lawyer Choi and Chairman Han-Seok. The little nuances they did here and there in their body language, especially Han-Seok with his killer facial expression changes, was really enjoyable to watch.-- The Scenery was nice
-- A few of the plot points were quite funny (the ones that were done in a good way)
-- Multilingual (So many switches between Korean, Italian, English, and Mandarin I think at one point was very cool)CONS:
-- Vincenzo's ability to get out of almost every single problem with ease was quite frustrating for me at time, to the point where in the latter episodes I was literally hoping that the villains got the upper hand in some way. To me, I just found it very unbelievable that he was ALWAYS a step ahead or that he ALWAYS knew more skilled fighting techniques. Like, I get it, Vincenzo is supposed to be one of the most feared mafia men in Italy, but he's not a superhero so I just feel like losing a fight here and there would've humanized him in a good way.-- I didn't care for a few characters: mainly most of the ""good"" guys lol. The tenets we are supposed to be rooting for are incredibly annoying and self righteous at times in the beginning. Then towards the latter episodes, it's revealed that they all have some ""superpower"" that aids the lawyers in their quest for ""justice"". I also found it very frustrating that they were all able to hold their own against trained mercenaries and assassins. I didn't care for the ""muscle"" that the baddies kept hiring because they were cartoonish in their lack of know how when it came to hurting literally anyone besides themselves. And lastly the lawyer/leading lady the lawyer Cha-Yeoung. She seemed to annoy me to no end with her self-righteous haughty attitude when it came to the villains. She never lost a case when she worked for money, then when she worked for the side of ""justice"" she still never seemed to lose. I did enjoy her funny moments though and the development of her romance with Vincenzo.--The PIGEONS! I have to mention the pigeons coming to the aid of Vincenzo in his hour of need, distracting the gunmen long enough for him to get the upper hand again. That one moment literally made me drop a star in the rating, so out of place and forced and cringy.-- Lastly, the ending. Too unbelievable and DARK. Vincenzo went too far with how he punished Choi and Han-Seok. I didn't enjoy how they didn't stand a chance. Han-Seok is quite a large man, and there was no reason he should've been taken down so easily. None of the ""good"" guys died because once again they were more than capable of fighting off all the trained killers. Han-Seok stabbed Lee twice and the guy was fine, but he gets kicked in the face once and is knocked out long enough to be strapped (by Vincenzo alone) into a Russian mafia torture chair. I also found it hard to believe that the multiple cop cars literally stopped their pursuit of a wanted Vincenzo because a tiny car a little bigger than a smart car blocked the road. Then Vincenzo manages to get out of the country only to sneak back in for an art exhibition a year later with ease just to meet up with Cha-Yeong and finally admit to the audience that he is a villain. I just kept asking myself by this point, ""HOW IS NOONE ABLE TO CATCH THIS MAN? SURELY THE AUTHORITIES HAVE HIM BLACKLISTED FROM ENTERING INTO KOREA AT THIS POINT?!""Overall, I still enjoyed it though. It was a wild ride. The cards were clearly stacked for the main leads, but I just put that off on the sometimes cliche k-drama formula. It was still quite frustrating at times (to the point where I found myself rooting for a win for the bad guys sometimes), but I still like it enough to happily sit through 20 movie-length episodes.",neutral,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

tt13433812,"I wanted so much for this to be a 10 star rating after watching the first episode. I was complete blown away by Song Joong Ki's multilingual abilities in playing Vincenzo, the real Italian backdrop, the international mafia storyline. It really seemed all so promising.However, all this comes to a lukewarm plateau in the next few episodes, where Vincenzo ends up in South Korea and begins executing his mission of extracting gold from the basement of a rundown shopping plaza. It was heartwarming to see the him be reacquainted with the Korean life he had left behind as an orphaned child adopted by Italian foster parents, but I had already been sold on the hard mafia opening in the beginning.What was most disturbing for me was that the entire series opened with the scene of him bombing the shopping plaza where the gold was hidden, but in the end, this was never realized. I was really looking forward to see how he would manage convincing the residents of the plaza to move out so that he could destruct the plaza and extract the gold, but this was never realized.In fact, the entire plot became lost in a mushy romantic comedy between him and Jeon Yeo been's quirky yet lovable character Hong Cha Young, instead of the international action thriller it promised to be in the first episode. It became a story of how an Italian Korean reenacted his love for his countrymen, and how much his countrymen revered the Italian mafia, rather than a high intensity shootout or face off between him and his enemies with Italian mafia involvement on both sides to increase the tension.At the end of it, I felt not only lost but deceived.

tt13433812,"When I read the summary of the show I was expecting a show which had elements of thriller, mystery, action and a well made mafia plot. But all I got was a wannabe mafia or legal drama which had comedy all over the place. It wasn't even a proper mafia or legal drama as there were hardly any courtroom scenes or any real mafia elements. The writers dragged this show for way too many episodes and most of the times Vincenzo doesn't even think like a consigliere who worked for the mafia. Even after so many attempts of accidents and killing, he doesn't think that it's wise to hire more amount of bodyguards for the people who are close to him. There are so many incidents which he could have avoided if he actually behaved like a consigliere. In the ending of episode 19 suddenly Vincenzo was dumb and weak. If you are a fangirl/fanboy of the lead character then you will love this show. But if you wanted to see a well made show like ""Vagabond"" then this convuluted mess isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching the show because of the geumga plaza people and their comedy, but I was expecting something serious.

tt13433812,"How to best describe Vincenzo? On the surface it seems like the Godfather meets Korean drama and the premise looks promising. In practise, I can at best describe it as a strange mix of black comedy, mixed with action and horror elements. Truly a strange mix, which ends up being confusing and you end up on a rollercoaster, but one that is moving in all directions!The whole story did not make any sense and was far from credible and may be culturally insensitive. A Korean adoptee who can speak fluent Korean and Italian with a heavy Korean accent. Right...! The development of the characters was stale and the plot twists may be surprising, but totally ridiculous.The sub-plot where Vincenzo was gay baiting someone was truly offensive. In this time of inclusion, I found this highly cringe and insensitive. It may be normal for a Korean audience, but in the rest of the world this is not done.We see through the episodes the violence escalating. Where it starts relatively innocent, it escalates into something increasingly more gruesome and gore. Culminating in the torture and demise of the antagonists: stabbing in the neck where we see blood pouring out, live burning of a woman and the slowly drilling to death of the ""end boss"". It intends to shock and wrap up the story, but I found it unnecessary, unsatisfactory and out of context with the vibe of the other episodes.The acting of some characters was quite good though, notably the main protagonist Vincenzo (Song Joong-ki) and the antagonists Choi Myung-hee (Kim Yeo-jin), Jang Han-seo (Kwak Dong-yeon) and Jang Han-seok (Ok Taec-yeon). I can appreciate their performance. It is just that everything else was incoherent and a confusing mess.And what about the take home message of Vincenzo? There is no justice in this world.

The fact that it's so unpredictable, cope with great scripts, amazing acting, that by itself make it a 10 out of 10 for me. Believe me, there is so much to its arsenal. Smart, gritty, bloody, heart warming, heart wrenching, to name a few. Oh yeah let's assemble one of the most diverse and powerful casting I've seen so far, in a Korean fantasy show.

I have been watching korean series for some time and they are really good. And this one is one of the best. Normally, I fastforward some of the series if it gets a little bit boring and I have watched Death's Game without any fastforwarding. I hope there will be other series with this quality. Strongly recommend this series to everyone. I gave this series 10. I would give more if it was possible to do so. Death's Game is one of the must watch series of korean tv series.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"I'm happy I've been able to keep discovering new shows intermittently from South Korea. I watched a lot of SK horror and Park Chan-wook films for years before I even considered watching K-dramas. My experience of such were briefly gazing at the TVs in the jjimjilbang, which seemed constantly tuned to soap operas little old ladies were watching that looked no better than their American daytime television cousins. I dismissed K-drama as an art form as beholden to either the latter pattern, or alternately sappy shows for teens who are obsessed with pop stars.Fortunately there are intriguing and entertaining shows like Death's Game. I'm hooked on this one, to my surprise I actually caught a series in process and cannot binge watch this drama at will. I have to wait until January for the next episode! I recommend you join me.Park So-dam from Parasite plays Death, and she's wonderful.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Wow, the story is really good, even though it's a fantasy genre, it's still tense, creating a tense atmosphere. The story line is fresh, someone who has died many times and been reincarnated in the bodies of different people. This series also features other famous actors who are no less cool than the main character. One of the series at the end of this year with almost all of the players being visual. I like the setting of the scene which is quite pleasing to the eye, not monotonous, arranged in such a way that it doesn't feel boring. Honestly, usually I don't really like films with fantasy genre stories like this because it will be boring and there are too many talking scenes in each episode, but this series actually provides an interesting story because it has a touch of real, exciting action and also has a mystique that makes me want to keep watching. I hope there is second season.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Just when you thought you've seen everything,here comes a Kdrama that breaks every rule, by creating a situation never seen before in television...then turning said situation on its head. It has been said that in the catholic religion if someone commits suicide it means your automatically destined for hell, well in ""Death's Game"" it also means you are seeking an audience with the Grim Reaper, and Death thinks it's disrespectful to seek it out... so it punishes you by putting your poor soul into 12 different people that will inevitably die... all the while giving you hope that if you can some how beat said inevitable death you'll get a chance at life. Seems simple enough right? But you would be totally wrong if you think you can assume how all this will shake out. Worth it!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

Not only was the acting/character portrayal was amazing, but the lessons I got out of it hit me to the core. Effects wise was also jaw dropping. I would watch it again and again. Once you started watching the show, there's just no point of stopping. I wish they would release this to other streaming platforms so more people could watch it. How every episodes are connected and the twists revealed only showed that this was a well thought, well directed show. Worth binge watching it!!!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"After watching so many kdramas, and reaching episode 6 and then 7, I was pretty much convinced that this is no doubt the best Kdrama I have seen, and also among my all time top 20 shows. But episode 8 just ruined everything for me.The best parts.Show is thrilling, you can pretty much assume what will be the end because of the premises of the show, but that makes it no less thrilling as several different characters and how it all ties up is brilliantly done, top notch thing there. It was pretty much given that after all that suffering ML will be given another go at his own life, this time to make a different choice.But then again, the last episode negates everything and also sort of contradicts it's own message and premises. There's another review that mentions this and I couldn't agree more with it.First of all, after going through all that, coming back to his own life, and remembering everything that has happened, ofcourse he was gonna make a different choice. So that just kills the point of the show, anyone contemplating suicide, if he/she knows the consequences of it will obviously make a choice accordingly, there's no free will to choose here when you have already learnt what's gonna happen.Second thing , bringing him into the body of his own mother was just too weird for me to accept, I completely understand the point makers wanted to convey as to how people who are left behind, suffer. But it was unnecessary, as earlier we have seen how his mother and Ji Su have suffered following his suicide.Along with this there are major plotholes. As now at the end our ML is brought back to the point where he commits suicide, and now he decides not to and the show just ends. But what now, will he be able stop the psychopath painter cum serial killer ? Will he decide to go against the rich heir who is also another psychopath killer in the making ? Will his gf die again ? Because according to death that was always supposed to happen that way, but would she be on the road if it wasn't for the soul of her dead bf now in the body of a model who was walking her back home and stopped midway to tell the story ? But death says she never lies and this is how his gf was supposed to die. But if now the ML never commits suicide , she wouldn't be at that point.And the other lives? The guy in plane, the schoolboy, the cop, the old homeless guy, the model etc etc. They all got to their point of death because ML soul was inside them. What's gonna happen to all that ?All of this never happened, and the ML was either just dreaming or forgets everything in the end, which makes the entire show even more pointless.Or he remembers, but how all the events through the show will take place if ML never commits suicide?The makers botched everything up with last episode.A much better ending would've been where it all started, and not where ML commits suicide. But when several years back, the second last life of ML was inside a middle age guy who runs on the road to get killed by the rich guy, that triggers the psychopath in him, and also is the starting point of where ML life starts to go down.The ML never commits suicide, he never ends up in the body of middle age person, never runs in the middle of the road, never the ML trembles and fails his interview, and he never gets to the point where he has to commit suicide. That's where and how the cycle began and should have ended.Again the show was good upto a point. But got completely ruined by the way it ended. Leaving several plotholes and contradictions. There have been other shows about suicide, which makes similar point, one is Tomorrow of Rowoon, and it deals with this point in much better way. Or there have been shows where the ML dies, but is given another chance to do different and better, such as Reborn Rich and Again my Life.The makers tried to do both points here and ended by ruining the show.I wouldn't recommend the show. Watch it only if you have nothing else to watch.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"This show is phenomenal! It is a must-watch for its cutting-edge storytelling (based on the acclaimed webtoon) and intense emotional journey. But viewer discretion is advised for its stark portrayal of death, suicide, and related disturbing content.It is a gripping psychological K-thriller along the lines of Netflix's The Glory. The work probes into dark themes related to the struggle to survive. It explores mortality, love, family, and regret. The suspense waiting for the lead's next demise is balanced with gallows humor, and there is tremendous emotional depth to the story.The production features an ensemble cast, similar to this year's Moving. Their performances are amazing! Writing is tight. Cinematography is beautiful and meticulous. For example, watch for an incredible one-shot action sequence reminiscent of Birdman. VFX might not match top Hollywood quality, but there are masterfully choreographed set pieces that keep you on the edge of your seat.For fans of the genre and newcomers alike, this is a series that demands attention.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Let me first say that I enjoyed watching this series. The ideas used were really pure and well arranged. The fourth and last part was very rich and emotional. However, every great work might have a few bugs that stay with the audience until the end.The first contradiction that I could not digest was related to the second part. ""Death"" in the series makes a rule for Yi Jae that if you kill someone, I will intervene. But at the end of the second part, when the character of the killer tries to escape from the truck, several people were actually killed! Why didn't ""death"" intervene there? Why did the bridge escape scenes look like Indian movies?It was pretty hard to arrange the bodies in the fourth episode when Geon Woo's character had an accident. (I understand that it is necessary to do this for the limitation of presenting violent scenes, but it would have been much better to satisfy this limitation!) What if the car hit two characters, and then the car came back, with Ji Soo's character beside the wheel? How? No matter how logically we look at this sequence, the mistake cannot be covered.I won't mention a couple other small things that aren't so unjustifiable. We can't wait for the second season of this series.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I used to love kdramas.. and to be fair, there are still some that are up to standards with intelligent script and mostly with HEART. This latest violent slap stick is certainly NOT that.Death Games is Typical VERY violent crowd pleasing Korea gone USA show. The feelings, when portrayed, are maudlin and heavy laden. Please! How disappointing that subtle, intelligent k-dramas have ended up this way. The ""meaning"" of this show ? Enjoy life while you're living, and love your mama. Couldn't get more basic than that. And if you enjoy a LOT of gratuitous violence, all the better. Pathetic. I feel sorry for the otherwise excellent ML.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"

I was really excited to watch this show asap after seeing the cast of it. With only 4 episodes of it I'm really satisfied with the cast together with their really good performances. Full of thrill that would engage you till the end. The protagonist's life along with deaths and reincarnation series is perfectly weaved and of course Death is as brutal as expected, no mercy! Be it visuals or individual acting or the plot even the ost is engaging. I binge watched it and was so in awe with the talent everyone has. The chasing scenes, the mother son emotion, the lovers emotion, the anger towards death's (character) talks and actions everything is portrayed perfectly. Perfect casting! With astonishing visuals and filming angles all the actors effortlessly catch our attention. Really waiting for the next group of episodes to see how it's going to justify the storyline further. Btw I've read the WEBTOON version also, there're a bit of changes here and there but it doesn't make any big difference and brings it to next level of perfection in drama version. 💯 recommendations!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

Those who haven't read the webtoon are in for a treat-it's one of the best out there. The cast choice is spot-on, and they're doing justice to the webtoon. Even though I've read it, I'm still eagerly awaiting the final four episodes.

Kudos to the whole team. The acting was so good, I found myself crying, laughing, getting angry - it triggered all my emotions. On top of that the cinematic effrct was top notch and the script was also well thought out. I'm not sure anything I watch after will fill that ""after a good drama void"" that I now have.

tt26225038,Gotta be honest lost my love for Korean shows for some time now and thought they don't make them good anymore for the last 2 to 3 years. But wow oh wow they truly have with this one. Absolutely amazing. Thus has rekindled my fire for watching Korean shows again and will be looking around to find something similar. I recommend you give this a show ASAP. Can't do justice by explaining so watch it and let everyone know. Best part is thay it's not made by netflix so doesn't have that typical netflix control. Hope they make a season 2 but can't see how. But nevertheless amazing start to end. Wonderful!!!,positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"The show could have delved deeper into the unjust circumstances (having to be a wage slave for all your life) driving people to make life-altering decisions like suicide or crime, while also engaging in compelling debates with death or god, questioning their inconsistency, hypocrisy, and foolishness.The ending was disappointing, especially after the promising direction in episode 6. It seems the show oversimplifies by suggesting one should endure poverty for the sake of loved ones, neglecting the underlying conditions leading to the character's struggles.The resolution of him 'winning' by accepting a life of extreme hardship raises questions about the portrayal of selflessness. The missed opportunity to address the root causes of suicide is regrettable, focusing instead on irrelevant matters.I hate that death's constant expectation from him to accept his fault feels unjust, resembling an unreasonable parent-child dynamic where the parent has high expectations and negative involvement, constantly taunting them for not meeting their unfathomable expectations.The show's metaphor of 'live for those you love' comes off as a flawed and simplistic message, as it considers the unjust system as acceptable.This could have been one of the best shows if it simply recognized or at least even portrayed once how it is actually the system at fault or 'god' for inaction in instances of injustice.",unknown,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"It is the case when not everything that is heart-touching will be useful. IMO, suicide is definitely not a subject for movies, even showing a suicide on a screen does harm.To be honest, actors performing is pretty well, and decorations look real, so the series is rather convincing.There are many ways to show that life is valueable and wonderful, so why choose suicide for that purpose ?And one more question - why so many suffering ? Authors wanted to show us that life is hard but it worth to live anyway? Why so much focus on death, suferrings and suicides ? Why not show us that the world / god loves us, why not highlight that people should assist each other, should appreciate every moment. Not. Only woes, homicides, head-shooting, tears and sufferings.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Wow... is that the first to say the series is Gore ... it hurts the stomach with every death... but the stories slowly get longer ..... (maybe that means more minutes of Mr. @jaeuck.kim )....The actors: you can tell they took care of the transitions between lives and deaths , in fact it took me several minutes to realize it wasn't the same person and that the actor had changed....The story: it reflects the core of the Webtoon, and what is different, is that the characters have a depth and a back story that makes you feel even more moved (I already cried), and hooked and it is that it is very well told.What I've seen today is a strange and very dynamic mix that becomes easy to understand and digest until death comes and it's over sooner than one would wish, you're left with a taste of little and want more and more.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

For a moment, I thought I had downloaded the wrong series. I wasn't initially drawn in by the first episode, but I wanted to continue to see why its rating was so high. Because of that episode, I gave it a rating of 7. I should also add that the main actor didn't perform well at all, and the characters didn't suit them. It's like they didn't even come into character. I hope the next episodes will continue to be this good.Kim Jae-wook has really changed.

tt26225038,"K dramas are usually known for having interesting, eccentric and out of the box plots but very sad to say that this show ( for which i had such high expectations!!!! ) Turned out to be so so so disappointing for the following reasons:
1. Lack of connection in the story. The show seemed to pursue so many different angles of story that it just keeps confusing you as to what is the real plot ?? Is it a murder thriller ? A true self realization plot ? Is it vengeance and romance ? What is it ???2. A predictable story. So called "" Death "" in the show tries to show our protagonist the true consequences of his actions ...throughout the series she keeps hinting towards an answer that he is supposed to reach ...and guess what ..that answer is so bloody obvious. I kept hoping for a "" OMG i never saw that coming"" moment , but i was utterly disappointed in such a low note ending. It does not give you closure at all.3. Just a bad plot. The story could have been so much better with such an amazing cast. There could have been a secret link between the multiple lives or a mysterious reason for the protagonist to go through all that he did. But no. The show kept pursuing several angles with none of the angles having a satisfying end or making sense as to why this subplot is part of the whole thing.UGH I am utterly annoyed after waiting for so long to watch this show with all my fav cast members.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Absolutely amazing.The journey, the cliffhangers, the castings, the acting, everything is top notch. Throughout the show i got to refelect on my own life and thought process. Being someone who herself struggles with such thoughts, i really got some purpose and insight through this show. Every single lifetime beautifully shows how even after having the aspects he was devoid of in his own life, the only thing that could make him content was being who he was and being with his loved ones.

Am not familiar with the webcomic so I have no idea what's coming down the plot chute. First episode was so damn harsh that I almost didn't come back for another round--but the high creative production quality hooked me enough to return for more of the insanity that constitutes many human lives. The acting is excellent across the board. Very interesting contrasts between dark and light visuals tied to states of mind and contexts. The motorcycle ride is wild and crazy and beautiful. A great deal of disturbing human violence both physical and mental is in play. Those with mental health issues might want to stay away as this offers none of the positive outreach 'help' of. Daily Dose of Sunshine. Bottom line though is that this is a great drama four episodes in.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"Due to failure, depression, loss of self-confidence and emotional breakdown, many choose suicide. Suicide is the only solution to survive all kinds of mental turmoil. At that moment no one thinks how difficult and painful life after his death can be. His family does not think about his loved ones. Many say when they are mentally broken - life has become hell. However, if I had known how terrible and painful hell is, I would never have compared hell with life.The main character of the Death's Game series is given the painful punishment of being executed 12 times for committing suicide. He is made to realize the life of family loved ones after his suicide, which he has lost.At the end of 2023, a unique plot, wonderful making, Park Soo Dam's great performance in a dark character, along with the casting of all popular Korean stars.

tt26225038,"So-so kdrama if you're looking for something to bingewatch over the weekend. The star-studded cast of various reincarnations weren't enough to lift the poor storyline and pacing. The cast is the only reason I'm still giving this 6 stars, else it would be lower.The show was adapted from a webtoon that wasn't really popular in the first place. Wasted opportunity since the show's writers could've just made it loosely based on the original story and developed something really new and tight, like ""Weak Hero Class 1"". Instead, we're left with a pathetic main character and his disparate reincarnations. You're expecting well-written interwoven/intertwining stories like ""Crash"" (2004). Instead, the MC just reads about his failed reincarnations in the news.The lack of continuity is jarring. So EVERY episode just ends up pitting a new celebrity actor/reincarnation vs the original weak main character. This goes on and on and diminishes his role further and further until you're actively hating on the main character.I find myself skipping ahead entire segments of the show just to see the MCs next miserable end just because I'm completely disinvested.There's no tension in anything because the main character is written to be an utter imbecile. If you've ever watched Final Destination, you know that impending doom and fear of death causes the cast to constantly be on their toes. Instead, the imbecile MC just goes YOLO swagger all the time, despite the high stakes of falling eternally to hell if he fails. Utterly STUPID.The premise of ANY suicide being a severe punishable sin which ticks off the omnipotent/omnipresent Death god is pretty silly as well. Feels like you're seeing a thinly-veiled Korean religious notions creeping into the show.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"

It changes the genre every 3 episodes. First it has a horror vibe to it.. Then it morphs into an action series....then it changes to sentimental nonsense.The idea is nice and the visuals are also good.. But like I've said, it looses it's track and gets really boring. The last three episodes are that boring, I almost didn't wanted to watch it.

tt26225038,"What an amazing drama with top tier actors! I actually experienced anxiety from watching the first episode. The first scene with death was horrific! I was on the edge of my couch watching all four episodes. Death herself was definitely frightening and believable. Everytime she shot him I cringed. The 4th episode was really excellent and sweet. The feels were really there and just when the conversation was getting good death struck. I literally jumped when that car hit them. I loved how all of the characters were introduced and connected with each
Other. Seo In-Guk is always exceptional with any role he plays. Heck I wanted to kill death too in episode 4.I had so many emotions watching episodes 1-4. I am not familiar with the WEBTOON but now I want to read it. It's going to be hard waiting for January 5th for the next 4 episodes. But this drama is worth the wait!

I really enjoy following the protagonist through his different new lives. I started out not caring too much about the characters. It unfolds as the show progresses - still, the characters don't really grow on me. But part of the beauty of the show is that this doesn't really matter too much as we get snippets of many different characters, which beautifully translate into a bigger picture. So far, I'd say that it isn't a ""deep"" show yet. Some moral clichés get filled to a foreseeable degree, other situations surprise. What I can say for certain is that the show draws me in and is definitely fun to watch so far.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"First of all, it's a must watch. Got me crying left and right. It is just so well made that you dont even feel like blinking because you might miss something. It is so exciting and keeps you wanting for more and it delivers exactly what you want. This kind of genre is different in k world but im glad this was made. A huge applause to the whole team and top tier actors.The only complaint i have is the narrative of suicide. The main lead who dies by suicide is made to realize the decision he made was wrong because the people that loved him suffered afterwards. The main lead shouldn't have been made to look like a coward or a bad person just because he decided to end his miserable life.But again, if a suicidal person watching this series decide to seek help from their loved ones, then its the success of the narrative.I loved the dynamic between death and the lead. Also the ending was super satisfying. But there are some cliffhangers. Like what happens to the female lead? Or all the lives he had already lived? Can he interfere or change them? It provokes curiosity. Who knows how the main lead's life change because he now knows too much. He has too much power and knowledge with him. I hope he gets to live his life happily with his mom and start a new family with the female lead, like he have always wanted.At the end of the day, after these dynamic lives that he have lived or the fantasy that he had to go through, the moral is that ""there is only one YOU in this world"". So lets live it even if we fail at times. Lets keep going together<3.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"Really nice
ep1 wasn't that good (if u compare it with other eps)
but as i had watched the trailer already so i went to the next ep too, after that its just amazing,ep4 cliffhanger is nice too, cant wait for next part (would resist the urge to read its webtoon till then)What I like about the show? It's pretty unpredictable, and from some movie maniac like me, that is saying something.Cast i snice too ( I heard they all top actors/actresses)
the action, drama, cinematography all peak
might be my next fav kdrama (depends on part 2)
i would really recommend watchingC'mon shoot me already.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I loved this series. Everything about it was really well done. The story was really unique and interesting, and when I really thought about it, it kind of reminded me of a Dogs Purpose, but much darker, and a twisted game.I loved the lead, he was perfect in his role, but the actor Kim Jihun, is living in his baddie era, and I'm not mad at it.It was so much fun watching each episode and not knowing who the guest actor would be, so that added an extra element of excitement to the story, but I feel like there was a missed opportunity in the last episode.SPOILER AHEAD FOR LAST EPISODEI would have loved to have seen a final showdown between the Yee-Jae and the antagonist (Tae-u), or at least some final closure. I didn't like that he got the last laugh, literally.Had the final episode not been such a giant bow that nicely wrapped it all up, I would have given the series a 10, which is rare for me to do.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I've watched a few tv shows that were adapted from webtoons before and I'm not saying that they're bad but I've always found something lacking about these tv shows. I think this show in particular has a decent concept but I didn't really like the protagonist. In terms of his characterisation, I think it made sense with how the plot was developing and that the writers wanted to write a more realistic character. Although he thought of the entire thing as a game, it was still kind of weird that he wasn't more traumatised by the numerous violent deaths he experienced. His main objective was to get more money, which yeah. I mean, he died because he didn't have any money so with this rare opportunity given to him, wealth was imperative for him.The way Part 1 ended made me drop the series though. Like why did that Taekang guy suddenly hit Yee-jae and Ji-su with his car? It didn't even seem like he nor his lawyer/driver was drunk. And they were on a sidewalk, not in the middle of the road. The hit and run was so random and it turned me off so much that I couldn't see the point in continuing Part 2 anymore.",negative,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"It's a wow series. I got a goosebumps actually. It felt like real. Nowadays everyones life like this, they think only for themselves and a silly reason they are doing suicide. They even don't think if taking this suicide decision how their parents live, obviously parents always care their children. The content was superb. It's a lesson to those who are taking such decision. Everyone should watch this series last episode was superb, how he struggle for just to fulfill his mother's bucket list. This can't be happened in real life so live your life happily with your parents. All the crew who did effort to making this series success...",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"I watched several Korean,Indian and American shows. I liked some,I hated some but with this one it is loved and I will always treasure this experience. The Acting is spectacular. The cinematography is on point. The choreography of action sequences are so unique that will blow your mind. There are some special effects too which doesn't bother me even though you can complain about it but with very limited budget with an extraordinary sound designing ,superb storyline and out of the box direction it is highly unlikely and very clearly cruel to judge the VFX or special effects. I respect,admire and particularly grateful to all of those VFX artists for their hardwork. The soundtrack will not disappoint you although it's not a 90 min soundtrack like other Korean shoes but still it works very well. Now about the screenplay I will say it is something so phenomenal that it will suprise you in every second and you can't predict anything about what will happen next .The twists will blow your mind completely and with each episodes it will exceed your expectations. The director capture the human emotions on whole other level. Now at last I can say that a huge group of talented artists create an art which have unbelievable action scenes,heart teaching emotional scenes and whatever you wish it will fulfill.

You cannot have asked for a better person to be the ML or FL or even the mother of the ML must get a mention here.I have enjoyed watching this. Even through it's main focus is dealing with a very serious matter of ""self inflicted death"" , it is done tastefully without the ultimate doom and gloom but then gives hope to those who are contemplating such to think again, there's always a way out, ""self inflicted death"" is not the answer there is an alternative.I pray that this reaches those who need it most and may it save a life.

We as audience feel like she deserves more.The show's cinematography and visual effects are also commendable, as they add to the overall suspense and thrill of the show. The cast's performances are also noteworthy, especially Seo In-Guk's portrayal of Choi Yee-Jae, which is both heartfelt and convincing.Overall, Death's Game is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys thrilling and suspenseful dramas.

Of course as given with most Korean Shows acting is superb, from a teenager schoolboy to an adult MMA fighter, they do a good job. Although sometimes I would find some scenes ridiculous and unrealistic (motorcycle chase through the supermarket), which to be fair deals no harm, it's just entertainment.All in all, 8/10 nothing more and nothing less than it deserves. There are way better dramas out there, I'm not hating, just saying. I still loved watching this miniseries.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

I haven't seen any movies that can touch my heart since I watched this one. It deserves more popularity. How can it underrated? With 12 lives and all of them talk about different topics, reflecting painful problems in current society. It seems that the director has invested a lot in this movie as the content is so meticulous, even the actors in the movie are all very famous actors.

tt26225038,"Began binge-watching this series last night...held back on last few epsodes. This is an excellent, stellar series; so glad I checked it out - my initial reason being Lee Jae Wook, an excellent young actor - but from very beginning this story just kept moving forward and becoming more and more absorbing. As usual, the entire cast, from main actors to supporting actors sprinkled everywhere are all talented professionals and unique in their parts - I have found this in so many of the k-dramas I have watched over last couple years; sometimes you even love the Bad Guy! Learning some unkown things about Korean culture through their productions, there is love and comedy, but the dark side of poverty & despair; rich or poor, expectations of children, the extreme bullying and physical abuse of school children by peers and adults, which also carries over in the workforce, corruption - but redemption. Hell, how can you not make good dramas with all these elements sitting there. Give this one a try!",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"One of the best produced K-drama. Hands down. From the acting to cinematography to direction, everything was perfect.Until the end. Like others, I also wanted a happy ending but this wasn't it.Issue 1:
Living as his own mother part is just odd. But it gets weirder when he gets back to his own self in the end, he has the knowledge and abilities from his past death experiences. That's why he was able to ""choose"" not to die again. This invalidates the message of this drama which it was trying so hard to convey. People who are struggling don't and won't have this luxury of knowing how to ""fix"" things.Issue 2:
This one is related to issue 1. But before that I want to say until episode 7 (part2, ep3) the story build up was just amazing. The school boy, prisoner, model, serial killer and detective plot points were beautifully executed. But what was the point. In the end all of this went in vein as now he is back in time and continues to live again as himself at his 13th life. All while knowing that a toddler, school boy and most importantly the love of his life will be murdered very soon (according to death it's inevitable). So what if a serial killer artist is chopping people and a psychopathic rich mf ruining other people's life! Death being so vague didn't felt she knows what she's doing, it felt she's being vague because writers couldn't give her enough reasoning why all the reincarnation centered around Park Tae Woo.Was it all a dream? If so, this drama achieved nothing. If not, these issues should have been clarified, as the entire point of the plots from episode 1-7 is nullified at the end. Perhaps another part after his 13th life could have explained how he changed things for better or worse. But pretty sure it will not happen, so yeah bad ending although its a happy ending.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

The cast are amazing, A lot of famous Korean actors and actresses. It is worth to be watching even you have to sacrifice your night sleep.

tt26225038,"Death's Game blew my mind. At first, I thought it was like Quantum Leap, where you had to try to find out how the person will die but try to prevent that from happening. But at the same time, it teaches the audience a beautiful lesson that ""life is precious.""First first few episodes were really there to explore Jee-jae's selfishness, how he was someone who couldn't bear living to being swooned by money once given a second change. But he was soon able to become serious once he witness his girlfriend die in front of him. Then the second half is like an elaborate plan to get revenge on the man who wronged her death.That alone makes for a really good plotline; that death has come full circle to watch Mr. Park, the villain, suffer for what he has done. But I think the real beauty in Death's Game is that it symbolizes that life is too precious. To throw it all away through death would not only make you regret taking your life, but it brings great pain to those around you. It really was beautiful, even if the show was seen more of some horror/suspense. Definitely a lot more different than those K-dramas that do tackle these types of issues. At least you got an action-packed sub-story that ties in well with the message it tries to bring to the audience.Definitely watch.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

that's the reason for my rating of 8.As some episodes became too hard to watch.But over all a good series.The end was alright too.Maybe I would have liked another ending better.But this wasn't too bad either.Some episodes were really good like the part where the girl friend is shown - (only too be killed off in such a horrible way)I also liked seeing Lee Jae-wook (my love from Alchemy of souls) - again for him to be killed off :(The cast is huge.

It hits with the force of a freight train, and keeps kicking even after the victims are down. I don't think I've cried so much since watching 'Sell Your Haunted House'.This show not only surprised me, but it also moved me profoundly.I cannot recommend it strongly enough.

The last body he has been entered many of you can imagine it but just feel it what will you do if you face Ye Jae's condition in your life. That's the most important thing, I think. I can feel the pain, the pleasure, the anger, the vengeance and thus it make this drama a pure masterpiece. I can relate the situation.

The story is original exciting delightfully entertaining and also profoundly meaningful and touching. Every cast member is perfectly cast to suit the character they are playing. So glad all these top actors took part. The show starts out strong with some movie quality effects. The plane crash and car chase with Jang Seung Jo are done with such high standard. But it's not all excitement. Each episode is different and with just a few quick scenes gets the viewer involved in each character. Some familiar K drama scenarios are so expertly incorporated from school bullying with superb young actor Kim Kang Hoon to prison with Lee Jae Wook. There is terrific black comedy with the baby and sky diving with Sung Hoon. There is one episode with Kim Jae Wook as the artist which is particularly violent but the viewer is in the unique position of rooting for one bad guy over another. The emotional episode with Lee Do Hyun is heartbreaking. Go Yoon Jung is quite the beautiful love interest. Kim Ji Hoon of Flower of Evil fame as the rich villain is totally convincing again, really the best villain actor on TV now. Oh Jung Se again shows his versatility. As does Park So Dam as a kind of grim reaper.Unlike Squid Game this isn't just violence without much meaning. This story is so much better. Really admire the way everything comes together and the viewer is rewarded for paying attention. Not a single wasted scene. I only hope more people will see it. Because it was released on amazon prime not sure that many people will have access to it. There is a very strong anti suicide message here. As the protagonist learns about the pain he caused to those he left behind. So poignant in the light of the late great Lee Sun Kyun. This show is so much better than anything Hollywood has come out with these last years. Kudos to the cast director writer webtoon creator and all involved. This is a series that will leave an impact long after you have finished watching it. So glad this was produced in 2023 when K dramas are getting enough budget to do it justice.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"Fascinating story full of lessons of life.Watch it before you die!All of dear staff, thanks a million for making this movie. You are the best.This movie shines as a beacon of excellence. From the opening scene to the closing credits, it weaves a tapestry of storytelling that is both captivating and profound. The characters are not merely players on a screen; they are living, breathing embodiments of human complexity, each with their own dreams, fears, and struggles. Through masterful direction and superb performances, the cast breathes life into these characters, inviting the audience to share in their triumphs and tribulations.Visually stunning, the film transports viewers to worlds both familiar and fantastical, each frame a work of art unto itself. From sweeping vistas to intimate close-ups, every shot is carefully composed, every detail meticulously crafted to evoke emotion and provoke thought. But it is not just the visuals that leave a lasting impact; it is the depth of the storytelling, the layers of meaning that unfold with each viewing.At its core, this movie is a testament to the power of cinema to inspire, to provoke, and to unite. It challenges us to question our assumptions, to confront our biases, and to embrace the beauty of our shared humanity. In a world increasingly divided, it serves as a reminder of the things that bind us together: love, hope, and the enduring power of the human spirit.In short, this movie is not just a film; it is an experience. An experience that transcends the boundaries of time and space, leaving an indelible mark on all who encounter it. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, deserving of its place among the greatest works of art in cinematic history.""",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

It goes so smoothly that you won't get bored and fast forward. The story is not watered down unnecessarily just to have more episodes.Acting was superb, special effects was great.

I love them all, watching them in other gems: HEALER, MASTER SUN, GLORY, ALCHEMY OF SOULS, etc.Welcome back, super kdrama DEATH S GAME.i have just finished it and I realized i haven t done anything else but watching it. Not even a mistake in the script, which is so rare. In other series is so obvious that there were a few writers of different value, experience. But here it s not the case.

Truly one of the best series out there and I confidently marked it 10/10 and strongly recommend it.The casting is great, the pace is amazing, the way your mind changes from the first episode to the last is a stroke of genius in writing and everyone in my work watched it within a few weeks as they could not help but binge watch it.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"WEBTOON's original story makes more sense, this drama doesn't make sense, there is something wrong, I know he is desperate and was thrown out of his rented house, if I were in his position I would do the same thing, if there was no one I knew who cared about me, would I have to beg to survive? It's still in vain. And the question is why didn't he stay at his mother's house first, he still has a mother who loves him and he would rather die. Secondly, how long has he been dating jisu, why doesn't he know that jisu has an older brother? Even if this scene were changed and Jisu was really cheating, it would definitely be painful, because I know what it's like to break up in love, that alone is hard, let alone the life problems that befall you.I also don't understand the plot where Park Taekang's plane suddenly has a bomb and explodes. Who planted the bomb? And why?When I see people committing suicide I feel like I'm not alone and I want to do it, but I'm a coward, I'm too afraid of death, now I just pray so I can die quickly without committing suicide even though it's painful and tiringThis film is quite motivating for me, being in Yijae mom's position is not easy, her life is surrounded by sadness and loneliness, but she never gave up, she's very strong.For this film, I like the visual character, Yijae's mother looks young and old with the same face, the editor and make-up artist are very professional.",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"

Quite, it's another high-quality korean drama series, if you've seen one or two of them you'll know what it's like, overdramatized moments, with a bunch of good moments, now I would say it's better than most, its format gives the benefit of allowing multiple perspectives and lifes, how people live and their circumstances, there were also a couple of surprises I didn't foresee.But while the journey itself was nice enough, the main character had too many moments that were... dislikeable to me.I'd still recommend this, while it wasn't quite as good for me, the series itself is on a pretty high-standard, and the negatives don't quite detract from how entertaining certain parts were.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt26225038,"""Death's Game"" is more than a movie; it's a profound journey into the essence of life and the repercussions of suicide. Its narrative resonates with those who've faced the shadow of grief, offering a raw, unfiltered look at the aftermath of loss. Having personally experienced the devastating impact of a close one's suicide, I found solace in the film's authentic portrayal of sorrow and its chain effects. It reminded me of the intricate web of lives interconnected by our actions and the profound consequences of choosing death.The film not only explores the depths of despair but also offers a glimmer of hope, aiding in the healing process for thoughts once consumed by darkness.

tt26225038,"Just finished watching this series after a few disappointments that had high scores here on IMDB. Has zero expectations as my trust in ""high scores"" had been quite shaken.This one was totally worth it though. Original concept (for me at least), excellent production quality, great actors. No open mouth chewing haha, and no ""plot fillers"" to stretch the series to the usual 16 episodes. I really liked that they skipped multiple sub-plot lines and chose not to create endless flashbacks like some other series.The plot moves along fast, I literally binged the series in a couple of days. Made me think, too.My only gripe is that the last episode is kind of slow and some emotional scenes are a little too melodramatic (had to hast forward all the soggy speeches). I really like the final resolution, though.Well done, team! Bring us more of your genius! :)",positive,"Drama, Fantasy"
tt26225038,"This series is so unusual that it is always interesting and sometimes surprising. It also manages to find a degree of emotional resonance through the inter-relationships of the characters visited by Death, or rather by the person she is punishing.Some of the early characters are vehicles for action rather than emotional resonance, which is fine. But as the series progresses its focus shifts and each life builds upon the previous ones in a way that sucks you into wanting to know what will happen in subsequent episodes.I am sorry that my comments are so ambiguous, but I am keen not to say anything to spoil the surprises this series delivers along the way.

What's in the store for Choi, when he starts reincarnating and whether he will be able to beat death in her own game, forms rest of the story.It took an entire episode to get used to this story and the narrative kept getting better with the second episode onwards. The twists paid off really well and that is solely due to the writing. 8 episodes was perfect for this particular K-Drama as opposed to the usual 16 episodes. The action and visual effects stood put but the characters getting introduced with each episode had a gripping storyline which ensured I was invested with each of these subplots which gets tied up pretty well. Just when I thought, the story is getting relied on beating the protagonist, the episodes 7 and 8 stand out with the twist that got me surprised. The emotional 8th episode truly won me over and though I wished the climax to have ended with the last life, followed by his surrender to death, I wouldn't pick on the climax much as overall, this was an extremely satisfying watch and I strongly recommend this K-Drama to everyone.",neutral,"Drama, Fantasy"

tt12451520,"EDITED REVIEW-
I wrote my earlier review after watching the second episode, and am editing now after watching the last episode.
I am in tears and the joy I am feeling right now is heart warming. This drama was so beautiful and fabulous... I have no words.
The story line is so good, you will be in tears and you will think again about K dramas, its that beautiful. Every character development is smooth, and its not complete 360 change which usually is shown. Its just becoming better. The costumes, music, scenes, dialogues, actors, editing, production... everything is so perfect I-... Its just awesome.
This show didn't disappoint me even for single second. The last episode is so beautifully, you will be crying that it ended and be happy about the ending the characters got.
And Boy did the actors act?! Kim Soo Hyun is famous I get it, but Oh Jung Se?!! Major shout out to him and Yoo Sae Ji!! these two acted so good that I got moved for real. I have seen Oh Jung Se acting as support actor in so many dramas, but this? This is how a good actor makes a supporting character into a Lead character. Its brilliant. New respect for both Oh Jung Se and Yoo Sae Ji.
This show is a must for everyone who thinks they are 'Not Okay'. This show will show you that being 'Not Okay' is 'okay'. You can have flaws too, and you will see that everyone has them too. You will see that being not okay is what makes you human.OLD REVIEW-
I have watched many k dramas, and this is very different.
Maybe because it's a Netflix original, but it has the touch of more than just k-drama. Whole production idea is different, including the story book display. Great concept. It's not the flowery, lovey dovey k drama fairy tale. It's a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes k drama's concept of childhood friends meeting again and dark deep dialogues. To say it's playlist is good, would be an understatement. Just two episodes and I am already in love with it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes.

tt12451520,"Okay, so let me start by saying I loved the whole concept of this show. The slightly ""other-worldly"" feel of it makes this show feel very different from anything I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, from Soo-Hyun's heartbreaking performance, to Ye-Ji's feisty, sadistic-but-fun anti-heroine, to Jeong-Se's unreal acting as an autistic man that is on par with Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. The music is lovely, and the slow-build romance between Moon-Young and Gang-Tae is so wonderful to watch.Now for the flaw - the ""villain."" I absolutely HATED the whole plot-line of Moon-Young's evil mother. It would have been fine if she had remained dead and was just this haunting, painful roadblock for Moon-Young to get over. But instead she somehow survived a fatal fall down a staircase and being thrown into a lake by her husband? And no, this miraculous survival was never explained. Also her face completely changed, and apparently she just got plastic surgery to change her appearance, but somehow no one knew about this? Don't forget she is supposed to be an incredibly famous and popular author. And she was perfect at faking being a really nice and wonderful nurse at the psychiatric hospital that her husband just so happened to be admitted to - how did she even get the job? She just had a fake name and resume? Did no one ever check up on this woman? Honestly it was so dumb and unrealistic, and when she finally showed her ""true colors,"" she was just so over the top ""evil"" that it was laughable and totally ruined the whole mood.The show was saved by the performances of our main characters, but I'm glad they left the reveal of the mother till almost the very end, otherwise I might have stopped watching altogether. I think its worth a watch for the good reasons mentioned above, but the mother story line is something you will have to just ignore.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"Let me start by saying this is an excellent acted psychological drama/love story, with the main protagonists scarred by events or situations they have been in during their life. The main setting is a psychiatric hospital & I will not go into the main storyline details b/c that can be read in a synopsis.I wanted to give this drama an 8 or 9/10, but there is one RIDICULOUS plot twist that I cannot forgive so I've only given it a 6/10.*****SPOILER ALERT******Okay, let us talk about the mom of the daughter still being alive. It really goes off the rails on this ""twist"" in Episode 14. In Episode 13, the mom was shown explicitly being thrown off a 2nd story balcony by her husband & directly landing on the side of her head on the below stairwell. She suffered SEVERE hemorrhaging that would have killed her; but let's say for ""creative license"" sakes she survived this event. She would have had a SEVERE traumatic brain injury & would be eating through a straw the rest of her life! But there is more. Her husband then throws her body that's inside a bag into a cold lake. So basically, she's now dead X 2.But nope, she's been alive the last 20 yrs. & is now the head nurse at the psychiatric hospital! Say what?? It's explained that she looks nothing like her younger version b/c of plastic surgery; and by looking at the difference b/t the 2 mom actors, extensive/multiple plastic surgeries! I don't know how she found time to go to nursing school.If that isn't enough bad writing, it's shows the mom/head nurse helping a patient kill himself that occurs in Episode 1. But there are surveillance cameras in his room. A detective with more than 1 brain cell could look at the surveillance camera to show her helping him commit suicide! But that would have been the end of this drama after 1 episode.To me, this type of writing is an insult to the viewer. I understand in many dramas you must suspend belief to a point. But this ""suspension"" is Friday the 13th Jason type-suspension. And this is not a Friday the 13th type drama. Overall, it is a beautifully written drama showing how 2 scarred individuals fall in love while one grows a soul & the other finds life beyond helping others.My recommendation is to watch this drama but have your favorite hard liquor of choice available in Episode 14..........it might make the ridiculous plot twist go down better.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"The main leads' acting in the emotional, dramatic scenes was very good. The scene that stand out for me are when Sang-tae cries out that his older brother wants to kill him in the hospital in front of the mural.

The drama shows various patients with a variety of mental health issues including PTSD, trauma, childhood abuse, autism, etc.Moon Gang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong's kiss scenes were really, really hot. This drama mentioned sexualities, condoms and even showed the two of them assumedly naked under the covers holding on to each other.Ko's fashion style - I love her designer clothes and gothic kind of style.

tt12451520,"I love Kim Soo Hyun, let's get that out of the way first. He's the reason why I watched this show. He's a remarkable and versatile actor and devastatingly handsome. I've followed his career since Dream High and loved every one of his dramas...except this. I can see the premise of the show, and it was actually promising at the beginning. As someone who suffers from mental health issues, I could relate with that aspect of the show, although as one of the reviewers mentioned, it glamourized mental illness...that part of it I didn't like. I do appreciate the healing side of the show and how the characters eventually experience growth and transformation. I also liked how they related every episode to a fairy tale. The concept was there, the execution, not so much. Sometimes the acting was too cheesy. I even felt KSH hammed it up in certain scenes. I liked the Sang-tae actor, he deserves an award for his portrayal. I also liked the secondary characters like Juri, Jae-Soo, and Manager Lee. KSH and Seo Ye-ji did have chemistry off screen (I watched BTS too many times to know), but I personally felt something was missing from their on screen chemistry. The plot was predictable-I already knew, for instance, in episode 2 or 3 who her mother was-and the script was pretty basic. It didn't give me anything new or something to ruminate on. It was literally just a CW show with Korean actors, and one of the reviewers on here actually mentioned how the appeal of kdramas is that they are for the most part more chaste...this was pretty daring, I must say. Very Hollywood, indeed...and I guess that's the effect of kdramas becoming more internationally known, and with the Netflix crossover, one can definitely feel the Western influences on the show (e.g. music soundtrack which I felt didn't match the show's mood). There were many ship-worthy scenes, which I would like to go back to, but the beauty of Gang-tae and Moon-young's relationship was ""the chase"". Once it got to ep. 15 and 16, where the two become an item and do their business, it lost its appeal for me. It seems like the show knew what the audience wanted and gave it regardless of whether the quality was good or not. Some scenes could have been done differently or left to the imagination, but I'm obviously the minority on this. Then the villain which **spoiler alert** the show built up to be this super evil and scary witch-once she makes her reveal, she's eliminated in the same episode like a pesky fly lol a little anti-climatic. I laughed because she waited, what was it, 25 years? To have her revenge. It would have been better if she just tormented her daughter from afar. She got caught by the police so easily and wasn't much of a threat. Finally, never in real life would I buy a book by Moon-Young for a child lol what crazy parent would? And ep.16 was unnecessarily long...even felt longer than the Lord of the Rings 3's ending.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This show itself is an apology letter to people who are mentally different from the society we have created thinking they don't understand us but it is exactly the opposite.
This show gives its audience what we expect from a classic yet different drama. The transaction from one scene to another is so smooth that you don't realise the effect as anything dramatic.

They are undoubtedly the best original Drian romance story and their representation is convincing and realistic without making a frequent occurrence in all the other Korean soap operas.

tt12451520,""" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

And of course the main lead actor- the BEAUTIFUL and TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun
I gotta say for someone who hasn't done a new series or movies in awhile came out strong with his acting, but of course that's why he's the top korean actors in S.Korea.. Watching him ""work"" this character in details, you can see he has his entire heart/mind in this for the next 16 episode, the connection between him and his brother (oh Jung-Se) melts my heart, the sadness in his eyes, the love, the laughter, we can see it through his acting.. so far just 4 episodes, and I see awards coming their way!

tt12451520,"The series offers an interesting story set in the format of a fairy tale. Fairy tales only end well, but are cruel overall (therefore, many modern generation parents even refuse to read classical fairy tales to their children). So the film reflects this element and the atmosphere well. The story is a slow churn, but interest and a certain level of suspense are maintained. Overacting by the female lead, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft (from Harry Potter) style mansion setting and over the top clothing of the female lead to me personally were annoying elements which distracted from the story, although they did play a role in depicting the fairy tale element and character development. Very realistic depiction of the character of the brother by Oh Jeong-Se. Well thought out titles of the episodes.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This drama's high rating is absurd. Viewers were continuously exhorted on fan sites to rate this show 10/10, never mind the forced acting, the dragging pace and the appalling lack of originality of the series. Fans have even been shamelessly trying to grab the ""most-watched Netflix series in 2020"" crown, based on inaccurate statistics in a site not affiliated with Netflix that tended to give dramas shown later in 2020 higher points than those shown earlier. Official Netflix reports have given that crown to other kdramas.The idea of fairy-tale themed episodes is merely a copy of ABC's Once Upon A Time TV series. The storyline where the leads turned out to know each other in the past is so overused in kdramas I could not help but roll my eyes when it also came up in this fan service. Excusing a person's rotten behavior because of things that happened in her past is a rotten cliche. There are countless brave and strong people who have survived much worse trauma than what the spoiled annoying female lead went through without becoming witches. But hey, dress her up in gorgeous clothes and serve up more sex and fans would go gaga. Just turn a blind eye to the harassment the male lead suffered from the female lead. Had the genders been reversed and it was a female being harassed by a predatory male, the outrage would been deafening. But no, the harasser is dressed in designer clothes and you have to understand, she is sick having been through a rough childhood, so let her be. In fact, shower this drama with awards. Sicko predators out there could take a pointer from this drama on how to get away with bad behavior. (sarcasm alert)Another proof of the ridiculous adulation this drama got - other kdramas are slammed for product placements, yet, the signature clothes blatantly and glaringly worn by the female lead even garnered awards!To fans of performers, please rate responsibly, not blindly giving top marks just to put your idol's show up some lists or to influence awards committees. This has already discouraged people I know from watching more kdramas, wary all kdramas are as bad as this or even worse, since this has such a high rating. Rhapsodizing this as a family show is really going overboard unless you wish to raise wannabe predators. But they would all get cured in the end, right? So, rhapsodize away. (sarcasm alert 2).",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"So many things about this series are exceptionally good. The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist.
Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Much better than The King Eternal Monarch where there was little chemistry between Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun.
Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching.
The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. For all those who have been disappointed by unsatisfying endings in K dramas this one helps to makes up for some of them.

Yes she had a hard and toxic childhood, but that does not give permission to be cruel and spiteful as and when it suits her. I could have been won round had the scriptwriters not included a scene where she tears the butterfly's in half, but after seeing that scene, I just could not see her in any other light but cruel. As others have said there are many who have had a tough childhood and a turbulent relationship with her parents, but they grow up to be compassionate people regardless of their issues. If you dig deep enough you can always find reasons for even the most ruthless person, but that does not make it OK. As for being a famous children's book author - what parent would allow their children to read such dark storiesThere are some light and humorous moments, the autistic brother and the Director of the psychiatric ward are fantastic, but at times I found it very slow. I am at episode 8 and struggling to keep going. The premise of the story is good and it has some interesting themes, but I think the scriptwriters didn't take into account that once you present a character in a cruel light they risk losing support for that character.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"It's Okay to Not Be Okay is a K-drama exploring the challenges of childhood trauma, the difficulties of mental illness, and the potential for love and familial belonging as healing mechanisms. The male lead is the caregiver Moon Gang-tae who looks after his autistic elder brother Moon Sang-tae, while the female lead is the fairy tale author Ko Moon-young. United by a tragedy early in their lives and dealing with their individual demons from the past, their re-acquaintance and growing attachment to each other enables them to face and overcome their suppressed fears.Artistically, It's Okay to Not Be Okay is phenomenal. The set design, the costuming, the cinematography, the animations, the soundtrack ... they are all incredible. The story's use of dark fairy tales to convey lessons is creative and the psychiatric hospital as a setting enables the spreading of awareness regarding different mental health disorders. The acting of the cast is also excellent; Oh Jung-Se is the highlight in his role as Moon Sang-tae but the lead couple's chemistry is also evident.Unfortunately, the show also has some serious flaws and failures. It falls into the trap of romanticising abusive relationships and does not propose good ways to manage mental health issues. Moon-young's manipulative nature and stalking behaviour in the initial episodes almost seem to be excused instead of maturely addressed. Therapy is barely featured, with practical solutions circumvented in favour of unrealistic ""love heals all"" and ""destined connection"" tropes. The inclusion of the one-note evil dead-but-not-actually-dead mother who also orphaned the brothers and was somehow hiding for years as a nurse ... that entire plotline only serves to diminish the coherence and emotional impact of the story. Finally, secondary characters like Jae-soo, Ju-ri and Lee Sang-in are lacking in their development and have unsatisfying story arcs.In conclusion, It's Okay to Not Be Okay excels in its aesthetic qualities and has some strong themes and poignant scenes. The show however disappoints in its overarching plot and lacks nuance in its depiction of mental health. It can still make for an enjoyable watch to lovers of well-produced K-dramas, especially those who favour tear-jerking romances.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""This line from ""Rocky Balboa"" seemed to ring loudly in my mind as this series concluded for me. Indeed, no one goes through life unscathed, and some take even greater lumps than most. However, no matter what we've suffered, it's perseverance that matters most. Not giving up. Always push on.To my mind, K-dramas are dominating the television airwaves. While I have watched a few bad ones, most have been anywhere from great to superb. ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" certainly fits the ""superb"" bill for me.As several reviewers have already mentioned, this is a very unique series that deals with the mental and emotional suffering that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. Perhaps that is what makes the series so relatable as well as profound with the central question: when do people finally acquire the courage to take responsibility for their own lives?For so many people in this world, we blame our parents for our misfortunes and our sufferings. Why didn't they love us more? Why did they mistreat us? Where was that unconditional love we were supposed to be showered with?Unfortunately, the answers we tell ourselves are filled with as many lies as the questions we come up with. Perhaps we weren't worthy of that love. Perhaps we simply weren't good enough. No matter what answers we contrive in an attempt to ""makes sense of it all"" we, too often, play the victim.Gang-Tae is a caregiver at a local mental hospital. His body is riddled with scars given to him by patients who have lashed out at him. However, his physical scars pale in comparison to his emotional ones. In short, he truly believes he is not worth loving.Sang-Tae is Gang-Tae's older brother with fairly severe autism. He suffers from a moment in the past when he was present for his mother's murder. The murderer threatens to kill him should he ever tell anyone about it. So scarred by the event, Gang-Tae placates his brother by making sure to move every autumn of every year. He somehow wants to be free of his burden.Ko-Muen Young is a woman who was touted as a princess by her mother; someone who is head-and-shoulders above everyone else. And people should be treated with disdain and contempt for being so beneath her. This is a woman who has no idea how to interact with people. She had no filter, and therefore, speaks her mind and her feelings, both good and bad. She is a little girl desperately wanting someone to love her.The irony is that all three characters, in some way, shape or form, represent some of the most common fears and desires of every single person on this planet: to be worthy of love, to be relieved of our fears and burdens, and to simply be loved for who we are.The series masterfully navigates how all three characters are able to find peace with themselves, and perhaps, even some joy culminating in a last episode that will have you smiling and crying at the same time.Yes, it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to fall. It is okay to be knocked down. It is not okay to give up and stay down. Everyone must find the courage to get up and keep going. That is the series' central message.The performances in this series are top-notch all the way around. However, accolades must truly be given to Jeong-Se Oh (Sang-tae) who turns in a performance that easily rivals Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" In fact, to my mind, Jeong-Se Oh's performance surpasses it. He is truly deserving of any awards he might acquire for one of the best acting performances seen in a long time.This series has almost everything: a mystery, laugh-out-loud moments, heartfelt moments, cringeworthy moments, and plenty of relatable moments, depending on who you are.I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It should almost be required viewing. For perhaps, you might find some ""healing moments"" of your own as you watch this show, and be presented with the question: will you blame others for your problems? Or will you find the courage to begin living your own life?",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The storyline is there but there are also a lot of scenes that are just time filler.Basically most of the characters in the drama have a troubled past and come together in this hospital. Seo Ye-ji has a slightly annoying yet bearable because of her stunning appearance character. Soo-Hyun's character is the best part because he is pretty normal and balanced and Oh Jung-Se acts superbly well for his role but the character he plays can be a little frustrating. You need to be patient with this Drama because some parts can be outright boring.As far as the screenplay and the visuals its awesome. The dialogues are pretty good, nothing crazy but some memorable messages. There is hardly any action and very little comedic relief.This drama is definitely darker, creepy, and on a more serious note than your typically kdrama.

It's like a void that will never be filled, in the most beautiful way possible. I love it so much and I really hope they somehow renew this for another season, although unlikely. The chemistry between the actors kills me, each scene they're together hurts me even if it's a happy one. I loved the magical realism and the little details they put into the plot, which just further enhanced the great acting of all the actors. If you're planning to watch this, I recommend preparing yourself 'cause you're gonna feel empty for a while after finishing it. Try to not miss anything and dedicate your full attention when watching it - that's how you'll enjoy it the most. I don't think I have ever shipped a couple so much, the dynamics and their backstories and the way they healed through each other are just perfect. The tension and the stares during those sweet and intimate scenes are what really pushed me off the edge. And of course, the funniest faces and lines at the most unexpected moments. I am 100% sure that this will probably be my favorite k-drama forever, I got so lost in their world and I find myself going back to it every now and then. I find comfort in them and I've gotten so used to it all. The familiarity you'll develop with the show is the best part of everything.

Luckily they just stream it on their platform so its not a cheap PC production like the usual Netflix stuff.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"As a psychologist and critic, I say do not miss this wonderful series in any way. Everything in this series from screenwriting, directing, acting, editing, costume design and so on It is amazing. All the actors played amazingly well, both with their eyes and with their limbs. Everyone's characterization was so great, including all the sub-roles, That you understood all their morals and behavior. The look and character of each one was full of words that you fully understood. This series was so great in the field of psychology. As a psychologist, I was amazed that they were able to master the details of the human soulShow that I really have to admit I have never seen it so accurate anywhere. You have to watch this series many times and very deeplyTo understand how much the series has small points and thoughtful dialogues. Add to that the soundtrack and soothing songs of the series. It is a masterpiece. About directing and editing and designing costumes that. Which is indescribable at all, you will realize that it is absolutely amazing with one episode. In my opinion, the score of the series should be even higher. Imdb , Raise the score of the series.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This has got to be the most overrated kdrama ever. It's okay but definitely not better than other kdramas that have lower ratings like Crash Landing On You, Descendants of the Sun and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin). It glamorizes mental illness, condones sexual harassment, has hammed acting and an unbelievable storyline for a villain.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"Actually I am not a fan of either the main actor or actress. I am a typical person who chooses to watch a drama because of the cast, while watching this drama my desire is actually just to fill my free time, not to wait for the comeback of the actor or actress. It could be called just an accident, but dang! even from the first episode I was very much in love with this drama, the main actors were equally very strong, their wives were very good, the storyline was not common and boring, it tells about someone's mental state, they have a good moral message. To be honest, since I became acquainted with the world of Korean drama, this drama has been included in the best drama of all time, in my own opinion. Look at this drama, I guarantee you will not be disappointed",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This is a series for 12+ of age. It's mostly a series written for children. Very childish. I wish some Korean series drama/romance are for the older target groups. It wasn't bad, but the series consists of 16 episodes. I only found it most interesting when something major happened and that was towards the ending of the series. It's a very soft storyline, nothing really exciting. All I was thinking during the first 6 episodes, okay a big spoilt woman with problems is harassing the man with words. The man is also having problems and you have to wait like 10 episodes until something romantic happens. Before this it's only staring eyes and some soft/romantic music while they stare in each others eyes. If you have plenty enough time and like slow and soft series you can watch this. If you are an adult and also like more adult series and a little bit faster paced series don't watch this. It will bore you.",,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"The acting, the script, the whole thing is high school level stuff. Actors who think pausing in a sentence is acting. However, Oh Jeong-Se, acting as an autistic adult, is amazing throughout the series. Truly great. I think he should be considered for an Emmy. What a role and what an actor. The rest, the acting, the script, the whole thing, is just so-so. If they cut out all the long scenes where people stare at either each other or off into the distance, the series could have been shortened by half. Still, Oh Jeong-Se is worth the price of admission.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"The intro is good, but I didn't find the first episode interesting as a whole. The camera shots were awesome as well as the transitions. What I like about the series is the way the female lead expresses her thoughts implicitly. The children stories laid out for each episode also contributed in making this series better. This drama also let you see the two sides of a story as well as the characters. All characters are flawed and made beautifully. A suggestion for improvement is to lessen the dull moments and fill each episode with more happenings. It was ended well though, I really like it. The female lead is also funny especially in episode 9.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"This is such a great show!! It got me obsessed within the first two episodes. The main characters are both so good at portraying their emotions! I LOVE that the character of the main actress is so different to other main characters to diverse K-Dramas. Ok so let me explain. In most Dramas its always this quirky, shy, innocent girl that has no idea about life or whatever and that always needs the help of a man to achieve something. In its okay to not be okay though, the female character is strong and independent. She has more like this personality where she knows from the beginning what she wants and tries to get it by whatever means. And can we just take a minute and appreciate how visually pleasing the main actors are like omg they are GOREGOUS !!!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"I don't get the hype really. I watched 4 episodes so far. For me I wouldn't mind if the leads were just annoying. but glorifying these annoying behaviours, I can't accept it. FL with Antisocial personality syndrome, a dark past, Different from the usual fairy tale nature of the romantic dramas. This would have made a great plot. but they focussed on the dark side of it. For eg, The assembly man's son ran away with the FL and caused a big scene at the election campaign. They showed that as FL done a good thing. I get that his father is not a good person. but what she did was not the right thing. Also Violent portrayal of scenes in a children's storybook. FL leads says it has deeper meaning to it than what is shown on the outside. But how children are supposed to understand that. But that would have been okay because the character can't really understand peoples or emotions. But the writers chose to glorify that. It is okay to not be okay. But it is not okay glorify the factors that makes them not okay.
I am gonna watch the show anyway. will update this then.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt12451520,"I don't usually comment or talk about something I watched, but this is a very highly recommended series. I haven't watched something that is very well made like this in a veryyyyy long time. And, honestly it is now one of my very favourite things to watch.I was kind of worried at the beginning because it seemed a bit different than what I usually watch since I started watching K-Dramas; however it came out to be exactly what I needed to watch.Whether you are into K-Drama or not, this is something you really don't want to miss.. It discuses a whole lot of issues and topics. Especially, for those who are suffering from mental issues. I am in love with it 💯.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt12451520,"Just so you know, I can't remember the characters names well so I'll be using other names that are not of the charactersThe cinematography in this drama is very good. Even by just the cover you can just see how well it's shot and gives the overall vibe of this drama. Many of the scenes were shot well to capture the severity of the situation. And the use of cartoons was well executed to explain the overall theme of the episode. For example they can say repunzel, and throughout the episode they might explain how ko moonyoung(FL) was trapped by her mother in the castle with long hair, waiting for her prince charming to save her. So each episode has its own theme relating to classic fairy talesThe three main characters' acting it immaculate. Ko moon young was this antisocial woman, who did not care about anyone but herself, has a dark aura to her and seems like an empty shell on the outside. She is so different from other FL as she is very blunt with her emotions and what she wants. She makes the moves in her relationship with the moon gangtae(ML). She has showed the most growth in her character with is very nice to see as the story develops.Moon gangtae is a younger brother that takes care of his autistic brother. He is a caregiver and has no parents as his mother was murdered. His life revolves around his older brother and has never had anything to himself. He always felt as if his life purpose was to take care of his brother and nothing else and felt neglected by his mother. In this drama, he will become a great support system for the FL and also heal his inner child in him and find purpose in life besides his brotherMoon sangtae is the older brother to the ML and is autistic. He is the only witness to his mother's murderer. Becouse of his mental disability, he was unable to express what he saw and only said butterfly as it was the only key thing he saw at the time. Becouse of this butterfly that promised to kill him if he tells anyone, him and his brother had to travel town to town whenever spring came. The acting of this character so great that I can nolonger see this person not being autistic. His disability makes him lack emotional intelligence but as the story progresses, he grew to be more emotional and cautious to people around him. He was always dependent on his younger sibling but he grew to be independent and more like an adult.None of the characters in this story felt useless. I loved the stories of patients becouse all of them came for different reasons but they all really needed to be loved.This story taught me alot about trauma. It shows we are all adults who still want to be loved and love like children. Each of our wounds are different and will heal differently at a different pace. No matter how you get there, all that matters is you are happy with your lifeThe ending could've been any better. Just soo good. This is my all time favourite kdrama.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It shows so much compassion with its difficult self-sabotaging characters and has such a patient and motherly way of holding them in tension with each other just long enough to give them- finally- the chance to find eachother....it shows how much we all need the loyalty of others to hold us long enough untill we find the strenght to be brave again. To risk getting hurt again and to hold on the a new hope of deserving love....trauma frezzes us inside and its impossible to warm yourself up again all alone. This series shows how we can find healing if we let other people in, slowly, very slowly....

The storyline, the acting, perfect casting, the location, even the in story fairy tale books/stories were brilliant!!! Just brilliant. I am just blown away. And for someone who loves korean horror/zombie shows (i.e. kingdom, train to busan, etc) - that is a big thing. I am absolutely amazed by the three main leads. The supporting cast are also top notch. Its the most well cast production Ive seen so far.
This is a k-drama that I can definitely recommend. It is a brave show that tackles mental illnesses and I am so very proud how this has been done thru this show. Good on you for doing this. We need more of these shows!
I wonder if those fairy tale books are actually real books? If not, then they should be. Loved the storylines there too! and the artworks!! Love it.
And last but not the least - the female lead's outfits! OMG - just for her outfits I would watch the whole show! I dont know who she is but she carries them so well, i love her acting and i love her voice!!!! Hope to see more of you in the very near future!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

What a character development!!...The big brother sang-tae,he is most promising character. This role actor act his role perfectly.when I saw him first ,I find him annoying,but eventually I understand his contribution to this story.Other actor was good too...

tt12451520,"Secondary characters are nothing special. The much vaunted ""path of recovery"" that should be noted throughout the series is interspersed with completely superficial events that have nothing to do with the plot and in some cases do not even affect the characters themselves. It's as if the characters have changes in completely random phases, due to events that never happened or simply because someone told them a single thing. This dynamic occurs predominantly between the two protagonists. The final part in which they had to force the mother out with a ruse that was childish and not very credible to say the least disappointed me to say the least. There are ideas in this series and they are all very interesting, too bad the realization is not the top. Pros: The sequences in which the fairy tales are told, the settings and simply PERFECT the interpretation of Seo Ye Ji. Good but could have been epic.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

You must be strong to watch this and even I cannot binge it.

tt12451520,"People can dislike my comments all they want but I will still go ahead and say it. This show was the worst kdrama I've landed my eyes on, for a couple of reasons. As a mental health advocate and psychology graduate I worry people take this show seriously. The way they portrait the female character as doing all these very despicable acts and portraying it like a badass character normalizes mental illness. There is no real message of psychology or self care. The mental illnesses showed were not very realistic and very stereotypical. The girl gets away with doing everything because she has ""trauma"" or she's just too badass. I also don't think it's okay that they portrait her as someone that can do whatever she wants around the main guy and gets away with it.The couple has no chemistry at all and the guy has zero personality nor he stands for himself and everything she does to him. This the perfect example of RUN AWAY from a relationship as it is a very toxic one. The only thing I learned about him was that he really cares for his brother, and that was it.Besides the cinematography this show was a huge disappointment and I don't recommend it.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

While this is very important for everyone's psychological health. This theme is beautifully depicted in this series.

Just like twenty five twenty one drama.. Sparkling Watermellon will make you recall your first love which could either be a heartwarming or a heartbreaking experience. Nonetheless, you'll feel nostalgic for the past and its simple joys!The show is still ongoing as I write this review, I'm on episode 9 and I still don't get its title?!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"This Korean drama is at turns delightfully light and emotional. The music is superb. The actors are adorable. There are elements of coming-of-age, rom-com, and fantasy time travel. But, foremost, it embodies a celebration of life -- especially of aspects that are sweet and sparkly like the title, Twinkling Watermelon.The emotional core involves the enduring dilemma faced by young people: whether to live a life that makes their heart beat or follow the lead of their parents. The main character Ha Eun-gyeol, a CODA (child of deaf adult) youth, grapples between following his passions and serving the needs of his family, when he is presented with an opportunity to change the trajectory of their lives by slipping back in time when his parents were his age. We're also presented with the question, would life really be better if the past changed to our liking?As the story transpires, we see some of the joys and sparks of youth, its conflicts and uncertainties. It delves into teenage anxiety and mental health issues and the pressures from parents and society. The show also portrays beautiful friendships and loving, albeit sometimes misunderstood, family relationships. The deaf character portrayed by Shin Eun-soo is a gem. And Choi Hyun-wook is a master at capturing the spirit and zest of youth.In a way, the show follows some of the winning formulae of other recent successes. As in the movie CODA, it peers into the lives of the deaf who face many challenges but lead meaningful lives. As in Someday or One Day, it makes you dream about rewriting the past, preventing accidents, and letting go of guilt and resentment. As in 2521 and the Reply series, it taps into 90s nostalgia, when times were simpler, when you had to run to a pay phone to answer urgent beeper messages and could drop by your friend's home anytime. So, in a way, it is not groundbreaking but a good story nonetheless.If splitting hairs, the series is not without imperfections. Time travel presents logic problems. It's apparent from the proficiency of signing that the actors are not deaf themselves. And there is a reliance on common tropes to create obstacles for the characters. But I recommend you watch this for its emotional journey and uplifting message.The main character's parents are deaf, but they are 'cheerful, healthy, and happy because they could communicate with their eyes, their hearts, and their hands.' We all have problems, but we can also grow, adapt, and have fun. The show promotes embracing music and loved ones: Seize the day, its joys and opportunities! ¡Viva la vida!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

It was such a heartwarming drama and it has definitely got the spot in my top dramas list.

The girl doesn't deserve the guy at all. Thankfully twinkling Watermelon is nothing like that. The characters in this show are given a real indepth back ground and helps you to understand them better. You can see the real emotions in the characters and their journey of highs and lows we see them in their growth. This story will make you laugh, cry and dance.

Then it's beautifully romantic and you will love the bond and loyalty of all of their friendships.And the most special part is of course the value of family and how our male lead is doing everything he can to make his loved ones change their fate to be the happiest they can be.There's so many complex subjects and subplots as well, but it works so well. Story is well paced and the twists are great and not predictable. The characters are well written and rich in layers and development.Honestly, the writers of this drama deserve recognition for this work.The chemistry amongst the cast is fantastic in general but the main pair and their bromance ( or better said father and son) is unbeatable. I had moments where I was honestly crying of laughter.I have been following Choi Hyun Wook and his impressive acting for a while ( specially in Weak Hero Class), and it's just very unbelievable to me that he is only 21. I can't wait to see more of him.But I do have to make a special mention of Ryeoun, the display of emotions he shows playing this character is amazing, he made me cry a few times and his eyes were just pure emotion the whole time. What a performance.Overall was an amazing watch and the only reason am not giving a 10 is because I feel the entire ending was a bit rushed, otherwise it is truly an outstanding drama.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt27446493,"TWINKLING WATERMELON is one of the best Kdramas of all time in every aspect. Well, this is my first time writing a review!! I've come across many beautiful dramas but this drama has my whole heart because it was so comforting. The way this drama portrayed each character and their emotions was just mind-blowing. From start to end, it got me on the edge of my seat, and the character development was just WOW. You will feel like you're a part of the drama where you giggle wholeheartedly, weep like a child, and feel sad and happy with every moment. I felt a mixture of emotions while watching this show but it felt comfortable, soothing, and warm inside. Kudos to the cast and crew for coming up with this beautiful drama. The screenplay and the narration of the story were just fantastic. Ryeoun (Eun-gyeol) carried the whole show to the next level with his natural and nuanced acting. He was soo cute in every way. I enjoyed Ryeon and Choi Hyun-Wook's screen time. This father-son chaotic duo made every episode funny and beautiful with their versatile acting. Choi Hyun-Wook (Ha Yi-chan) will be my favorite character of all time. He showed how to turn someone's shortcomings into something really beautiful with his outstanding delivery of emotions. I've never seen any of Shin Eun-soo (Cheong-ah) dramas, this is my first show and I was stunned to see her performance. Though she was deaf and dumb in the whole drama, her twinkling eyes spoke every emotion that can't be described with words. Whenever she smiles, you'll feel her joy, whenever she cries, you'll feel her sorrow and her silence will shatter your heart. Mother-son duo screen time will break and mend your heart at the same time for sure. The endearing love between Omma and appa, and Ajussi and ajumma will make your heart flutter. Seol In-ah's (Choi Se-kyung / On Eun-yoo) chemistry with Ryeoun was at top notch. Seol In-ah did a great job with her acting and showed that everyone has flaws and struggles in their life and that ending our life is not the only solution. Though the ending was bittersweet, it was the perfect ending that we all wanted. It ended with the note that everything happens for a reason, hold on there, and live your life to the fullest without pondering over the things.🍉 WATERMELON SUGAR.... VIVA LA VIDA 🍉",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"The characters are lovable and they played their part well. You'll fall in love with the main cast and hate the villains. It's a time travel romcom but this doesn't focus on the technically of time travel but rather the simple ""if you change some things in the past you change the future"" kind of thing. I did not read the details and trailer and just straight up watch this series. I was disappointed after finding out this is a time travel movie since I just finished watching ""A Time Called You"". Honest take, it is way better than this. I just don't get the very high rating. Probably because I saw A Time Called You first and thought it was brilliant. It's like you're coming in expecting part 2 of a movie to be better than the first however for this series it's not. It was dragging. A Time Called You only had 12 eps. This series has 16 eps but lots of filler scenes. Don't get me wrong, it's fun but this just doesn't deserve a 9 to me.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,Anyone who has seen Back to the Future will recognize the concept and premise. A teen goes back to the time of his parents youth. The K drama element is that it is more emotional and that is where the drama shines. There are some really touching scenes with the son and father and mother. He sees his parents own difficulties growing up and sees things from their POV.Also it's exciting to see if and how the future can be changed especially trying to avoid the accident that caused the father's deafness. Although irritatingly it seems too hard to stop the accident. Went on too long. The abusive teacher is a dramatic plot line. There have to be villains.The cast is exuberant and acts well. Ryeoun is good and Choi Hyun Wook is enthusiastic. Seol in Ah isn't as pretty as the character suggests as the prettiest girl in school though.The main faults are the length and the lack of funny moments. The drama should have been 12 episodes. There are lots of unnecessary and repeated scenes. And unnecessary dialogue. The first part is actually very confusing. There isn't that much story. Another fault is the comedy is often not funny. In fact it is just never funny. So it is like a musical drama but not a rom com. The writer just doesn't have a good sense of humor. Don't recall laughing at any joke. Did not like the ending that much. Rushed without a lot if explanation of the positive changes. Could have shortened the previous episodes to show more detailed explanation. He could not prevent his father's deafness and he had no memory of his better life. There is no way to explain time travel changes to everyone's satisfaction but in this show not enough of an effort was made.,negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"I just finished watching it and I can't stop the tears from falling. ""Viva la vida"". I realized I'm just really happy to be alive because I got the chance to watch the amazing drama ''Twinkling Watermelon"". Each and every single thing of the drama was so beautiful that the cocktail of feelings seeped into my chest and my veins, filling me with warmth from the inside out. It's the best healing & comfort kdrama ever existed. Everything of the drama was so perfect. The casts, songs, soundtracks,storyline,acting... every single thing was beyond perfect and beautiful. I'm just really thankful to watch the beautiful creation.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"Really good drama that lets its four leads sparkle. Twinkling Watermelon features themes of family and identity at various times in the characters' lives, and while it looks like a fun ride on its nostalgic surface, this series has bigger emotional payoffs simmering just under the surface. Boy, do the final two episodes serve up the full force of the writer's prowess. In the end, each character develops the tools to help them communicate better whether through signing, music, or simply summoning the courage to ask the questions they never could. The male leads are excellent especially in the finale episodes but it's Choi Hyun-Wook, who has shone in everything he's done to date, demonstrating again why he'll be the next big thing in Korean tv.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"It's not long since I started watching Korean dramas. But I can boldly say that this series was so different and special for me both among the Korean series that I saw and from the series of other countries that no matter how much I say, it is not enough.Eun Gyeol's character with Ryeoun's amazing acting captivated me so much that it is impossible to express. Also, the acting of each member of this movie is indescribable.Apart from all this, the story of this series was so honest and pleasant that I don't think there will be another series like this. Yi Chan and Cheong Ah's love was infinitely pure and beautiful. Also, Eun Gyeol's passionate love and feelings for Se Kyung.This series made me feel good from the first episode to the last episode and I really fell in love with it.With this series, I laughed from the bottom of my heart, I cried hard, My heart felt real happiness, and most of all, it taught me a great life lesson.And I must also mention the music of this series, how amazing it was. I can't stop listening to his songs. They are great.Thank you for making such a unique series that I am sure I will watch again and again.I want to have a twinkling youth like this series... a memorable youth for myself.Forever... Viva la Vida.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"There didn't seem to be any mention of the core of this story, which is the many ways that love can be expressed. And communication is a foundation for all to learn. I am a Coda and totally found this KDrama to be warm and well thought out.My deaf mother used to always buy a car that had a radio and good speakers ! Just because she couldn't hear didn't mean she didn't want me to appreciate music. She did always enjoy the vibrations from music.So I loved that they showed this in the story.And there are several gems of wisdom thru out the story line. I think I'd like to watch it again to highlight those moments to write down to remember.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"This is a charming show, with wonderful leads and a fine supporting cast. Time travel shows are always hard to pull off and while there are some plot holes, they are tolerable. I would have liked the final episodes to tell us more about the return to 2023, especially Eun-yoo's story but this is a minor complaint.In this show, a boy (Ryeoun) and a girl (Seoul In-ah) travel from 2023 to 1995, the boy to meet his father (Choi Hyun-wook), make sure he meets his future mom (Shin Eun-woo) and save him from a serious accident, the girl to escape her dysfunctional parents with the idea of changing the past so she will not be born. The two romances that ensue are heartfelt, even if many obstacles must be overcome.Much of the show tells of the band formed by the father, a high-schooler in 1995, which his time traveling son joins, the father's objective being to capture the heart of the girl (or her mother - you'll have to watch) and the son's being to prevent his father's accident. Comedy and drama intertwine. The series delicately and compassionately deals with the challenges faced by deaf people and CODAs (children of deaf adults).If there are to be some criticisms, perhaps some of the pantomime villainy of Shin's step-mother (Kim Joo-ryoung) could have been omitted. Also, while I find it, er, unpalatable having to watch another series enslaved by the all-powerful Korean catering industry, I also must offer up my respects to the inventor of the fast forward button that allows one to skip over the eating scenes without losing any of the story.I don't want to give away the plot, but it all works pretty well and the leads will keep you engaged throughout. Light fare that is eminently binge worthy.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

This drama made me understand my parents better!!! It's the best drama for 2023. Even though there is time travel involved, the story is more about parents and children understanding each otherand having a healthy and loving relationship.I love the cast. The chemistry among them is wonderful. I wanted to go hug each one of them. Keep shining. Viva la Vida! It's one life live to your fullest.

I was waiting for some k drama to break the record again , and dude this is it.""Recently, some of the K-dramas released aren't that good, but at last, this masterpiece just broke out.""If you enjoyed the vibes of popular dramas like 'Youth of May,' '21-25,' 'Hometown Cha-Cha,' 'Beloved Summer,' and 'Reborn Rich,' then this ones a must watch

tt27446493,"Firstly,I'm gonna say that despite of all the negatives that I'll write below,I still think that this drama is interesting and have some of very lovable cast. But it simply doesn't deserve such a hype and high rating.This show brought kdrama-known slow motion to whole another level. It isn't even slow motion anymore,they drag some slow motion scenes to the point that you think that your screen is frozen,cause it probably is.The deaf girl,second FL has very sad and lonely life,but why does she have to be so rude and cocky to apsolutely everyone exept the boy she has a crush on? How can she fall in love with the person she never had any contact with but isn't capable to develope any kind of normal emotion with anybody else? I get why she is angry but she is way to rude and I simply don't see why would such a bubbly guy like Yi chan fall for her.And the last but not least,I just hate when kdrama writers put some average looking girl and present her as a epitome of beauty and every boy in every school is in love with her and I'm like,why? Are they blind? But I still try to like her but I CAN'T cause she has a role of some forced arrogant beauty. And not to mention her haircut;OMG.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"It was so highly rated and so much talked about, but I couldn't bring myself to watch it as I didn't find the plot too exciting.Finally I gave it a shot, as I love time traveling cinema, although I knew this was supposed to be less scifi time travel and more life emotional drama based.But I haven't seen such overrated kdrama. It nowhere deserves an almost 9/10 rating. It's a below average show.For starters, it is supposed to be an emotional depth drama with teenage fun and issues, and understanding our parents as teenagers. But sadly it falls flat on those parts. The two male leads, though had good chemistry and you can see them as friends, but couldn't connect on an emotional level, they hardly had any deep emotional exchange, except maybe a couple of scenes, one on the island and one in the end, but even those weren't impactful.The two main couples, neither of them had any romantic chemistry, neither they felt like a couple, if you are hoping this to be a romantic kdrama, then it isn't by any means , so don't watch it for romance reasons.A large core of the show is music, but I personally didn't like any of it, none of the songs made an impact and I didn't bother to even look them up to add to my music playlist, on the contrary after a while of same repetition of songs in their band practice sessions etc, I even skipped a few scenes of just same rock music playing and nothing else happening.A whole lot of ultra slow motion scenes, sometimes so slow it feels like your screen is frozen. Again, none of such slow motion scenes had any impact or depth. Usually kdramas are good at that. Not here.The only scenes which felt emotional, were between our ML and his now teenage mom who he meets in past, and they were introduced so late in the show, like happens around 7th episode, and the emotions and feelings were instantly visible, but they were so less, way too less. The amount of time spent on son and dad, not even 1/10 of the time was spent on son and mom, and that should have happened more, because she was in much more need of his help than anyone, learning sign language and getting bullied at school, from being a completely shut off person, to home abuse, she needed help in everything, and it would've been a lot better of a show if it was focused on these things. Instead of wasting so much time on creating band, and music and festival preparations etc.The biggest plothole for me was the FL part. She comes back, and in trying to set up her mother with her first love instead of his father, what was that ? Like she thought if she imitates her mother, and make the second male lead fall for her, and then she disappers, her actual teen mom comes back from US, , and then she'll magically become a couple with the second ML? She obviously knew that her mom never comes back from the US till years after she was born. Even if by any chance her mom comes back, she won't be a couple with second male lead. It was so rubbish that even explaining it is bothersome. That whole part that happens in first 11-12 episodes is absolute garbage and stupi and senselessThe acting was subpar with ML being good in emotional scenes.I won't even mention the details of how time travel happens, because that's just a tool used here without any explanation.Also, it falters in a very important reason. Why were both leads made to time travel? I can understand FL reason, as to why she was made to time travel, and it feels justified. But problem is that hers wasn't the core of the show and not even shown in the end. Hers was like a sub sub plot.The ML reason to time travel and then comeback wasn't impactful at all. ML and his family were already decently living, not ultra rich, but well settled. Both parents were loving, bond between brothers was great, ML wasn't having any major life altering issues, except that his dad found out about his guitar music love. And then he goes back, and then comes back to present. All he managed to do was make his family ultra rich. Their love and bonds didn't change, because there was no need for any improvement. His love for music found out by dad could've been easily resolved , as ML parents were so loving and understanding.On the contrary FL reason to travel back in time, understand her teen mom and come back to future, what changes she made, that wasn't even shown in the end, how her bonding with mom and her father, and between her parents improved or changed, it wasn't even shown.This show is totally messed up and plain garbage. A Time Called You, is way way way much better than this and so beautifully executed. Twinkling watermelon is the most overrated kdrama. Not at all recommended.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The acting in it is superb and the bromance between father and son had me more captivated than the love interests. Although, they did very well with the love interests as well for sure. This was such a heartfelt show and Choi Hyun-Wook had me obsessed with his acting. Ryeoun paired so well with Hyun-Wook that I loved ever minute of this drama. I loved the story, I loved the acting and it had a great ending...what more could you ask for? Because of Hyun-Wook's acting, I am now watching every show he has starred in and I am blown away by how good he is. Now I see why he won a best new actor award. I look forward to seeing him in many more dramas.Honestly, there is nothing I didn't like about this drama. It was engaging from the first episode and tugged at my heart strings the entire show. Not to give any spoilers, so I won't say who...but when one character does a solo song for someone...I about had a complete breakdown. The most beautiful thing ever!! It was one of the most perfect moments and this person solidifed themself to me as one of the best actors I have ever seen. All the actors on this show deserve some awards. This show will go down as one of the best kdrama's have to offer. That coming from 3 generations of us watching it. My mother, myself and my 17 year old daughter...all of us were obsessed.

The characters played by all 4 main cast are just to the point. Choi Hyun work is what the twinkling stands for. All the seriousness and soft supple element can be brought by just one being - Eun Soo. Ryeon and Seol are obviously flawless and carry the plot by themselves when it turns into a slice of life at moments.A must watch for all folks even if they never watched KDrama before.

Well, the series IS that in a way, but the first chapters were funny, the acting was delightful, and the addition of the music topic kept me interested. Being Latin-American and the mother of a deaf child, both the visceral playing of a Spanish guitar and the introduction of signal language kept me interested.Later, I found the development of the characters and the intricate three-generation children-parent histories both brilliant and mesmerizing. Pure entertainment, but the message of ""not to give up to giving up"" was powerfully conveyed even amid the funniest comedic scenes.I strongly recommend this series, which is very universal and ""visual"", easy to be followed with subtitles.Kudos to actors, directors and writers that created such a well-adjusted woven of emotions that will appeal to everyone!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Storyline and Good actors are the most important for the drama. In my humble opinion, Sparkling watermelon has done so well in telling the time travel scene, interesting enough to let me wait for another episode. Eun Gyeol has done so well telling us what FAMILY means to him. Same goes to Yi Chan where he treat his friends so well. The romance between the Eun Gyeol n Se kyong also interesting to watch as both actors show good chemistry between them. The memorable scene would be when the two met at the airport and confronting each other later on. I love the drama overall. It inspired me little bit on things i should do in 2024.

tt27446493,"I love every bit of this show, except for tiny one. Yeah time travel is an incredibly complex plot to cover and yes this show makes it seem like a child's play, therefore you should NOT except consistency in that case whatsoever, you'll understand me if you've watched 12 Monkeys or Dark. But this show isn't actually about time travel anyways. It's about friendship, love, family. It's about forming sincere bonds. It makes your heart melt in some scenes, makes you laugh out loud in some others. Not only do characters bond with each other but you as the viewer also bond with them. It can easily become anyone's comfort show. THAT is the reason I love it so so much.But...
Spoiler comes here, don't read if you haven't finishedI really couldn't bring myself liking their ultimate end. I understand that Cheong-ah comes from a wealthy family and she made up with her father in 1995 and that means her new future could change in a way. But I don't think they needed to become this forefront successful ""business"" family to be ""better"". For me their former family was also so sincere, lovely, and just as enough. They didn't have so much money before, but they had everything else. Did they really needed to be ultra rich and famous to be happier? In fact when I saw that they happened to become such big famous people as a family, I kind of dissociated with them. That is my only criticism and hence my rating. I wish we could see their new future condition in a more sincere setting rather then being exposed how they became high society. The writers really must have thought this is the most fulfilling ending: seeing them rich and having power. I couldn't disagree more.

tt27446493,If you liked Twenty Five Twenty One then you will love Twinkling Watermelon. I went into this having a vague idea on what the synopsis was. However what I did not know is how hooked I would instantly be. It's a good thing I started watching this on a Friday rather than weekday as I would've had to call in sick. I binged watched all 16 episodes Fri-Sun...It was that good.I loved the whole leading and supporting cast. As I watch a lot of Korean shows. I was already familiar with a lot of their other work which made this a wonderful reunion. TW is just beautiful in every way possible. Not a lot of fantasy dramas are executed as wonderful as this series. It's a beautiful roller coaster ride which will leave you wanting more and more. It was nostalgic and simply Euphoric!!!,positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"So I will be honest that I LOVED LOVED LOVED the series !I can say I flew through it and literally binged it.But after being so invested in the character of Ha Yi-chan it was beyond my understanding that WHY the whole time travel and series took place if he wasn't going to be saved.Ha Yi-chan character is the life of the series. That laugh, that singing, that lively personality. I was watching the whole series hoping to see him saved.But after watching 15 episodes - they went and showed in the last episode that IT IS WHAT IT IS.So he had gone back only to make them rich ?There has always been a lot of comparison between twinkling watermelon and lovely runner. Atleast in lovely runner the girl gets saved from getting injured and the guy gets to live. So we understand the whole reason for back and forth travel.Here it became pointless if destiny cannot be changed.And then not to mention the girls character who travels back and pretends to be her mom.How exactly can she change her moms destiny by pretending to be her?Her actual mom is in america doing what the original past is.So her pretending may complicate things for the characters in Korea. But does nothing to her own history.So that whole story line was baseless and silly to say the least.And they didn't even tell us in the end that HOW did her future change.She wasn't in the same house as before. So where did she go?So from being a 10 - it dropped dropped dropped until its at a 7the more I think over it - the more annoyed I get :(I would have loved a happy ending. For me this wasn't one.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Good Triumphs Over Evil- Yes

The journey is so full of realism, charm, delight, turmoil, lots of twists, turns, dead ends, danger. He learns important lessons and tries to change history. Watch it and see what happens.

He deserves lots of accolades.His past dad, Ha Yi Chan, played by Choi WonYoung is phenomenal. Bright, witty, embraces Eun Gyeol as a friend.Then there is the 40+ Ha YiChan, played by Choi WonYoung with passion, perplexity, anger.The entire cast, from the very evil stepmom, to the girlfriend, brother's friends, grandmother, mom's dad, mysterious music shop owner, parents, give unique, spot-on and compelling performances.This is a story of love - first loves, family love, friendships, love of music ...The only downside is the name, this drama deserves a better name.

This drama gave me excitement every Monday and Tuesday knowing that the new ep was coming and became my comfort drama. They did an excellent job in the casting. Especially Seorina. I found myself smiling, watching her <3 I liked how energetic she is and chaotic at the same time and her chemistry with Eun gyeol was the Best Part. Han Eun Gyeol amazed me, The way he would do anything so his parents can sparkle and If I had a chance to go back in the past I will do the same as he did. I also enjoy watching Cheong-ah and Hi-chan the chemistry was perfect and the band, It's fun to watch their friendship. I guess all the cast is perfect. I learned a lot from this drama. One thing that I will never forget ""You don't have to try so hard to be impressive. Continuing to live is already a great feet. And no one has the right to judge others pain.

tt27446493,"So, Twinkling Watermelon... the first thought that would've come to mind is ""What a weird name"". A normal reaction because even if we are used to weird namings of K-dramas, food has mostly never been used in titles.But be that as it may, Twinkling watermelon brought on a flurry of emotions to anyone watching it.It was tough at times, having to wait an entire week for the continuation of the story haha, but we all got through that somehow.Twinkling Watermelon was like a breath of fresh air to be honest. Contrary to a typical K-drama romance, this one involved Time Travel and boy did it help enhance the story.Meeting his father when he was younger and becoming friends with him must have been a surreal experience. Learning about the life of his mother and father before they got married, experiencing first hand the hardships they had to go through, and learning about his father's accident and his mother's struggles all helped EunGyeol realize that his Mother and Father were not always as happy as they were during the present and that what may be shown on the surface is not always true.The show had many emotional parts that had us on the edge of our seats too sometimes, haha. But it also had had it's fair share of enjoyable parts, especially how the relationships between the Main Leads changed over time and how Eungyeol tried his best to match his mother and father up as soon as possible, even at one time being misunderstood (due to his actions) that he ""liked"" his father.As we got closer to the end, I was always anxious as to how/what the ending is going to be but safe to say, I wasn't disappointed. The ending was well executed and the buildup during the last episode was EXTREME to say the least. The uncertainty that went through every watcher's mind as they watched the last episode was completely eliminated during the last few minutes of the show. But well done Writer for making us so anxious during the episode!Overall, Twinkling Watermelon had an amazing story, proper development between leads, a good pacing, and a well executed ending and for that reason I'd recommend it to anyone interested in watching it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt27446493,"I really must say that this was amazing!?!I must admit that i though, Eun-Gyeol was the father when i saw the videos on Tik Tok. He always took care of Yi-, so it just seemed natural to me.After i found he wasn't, it also made sense. I could also see it from the other perspective now. How he wanted to protect his father at all costs, since his father still was (Extremely) wild. I liked that i could see the fatherly side from both perspectives.I loved how this series really made us wish that the future would change, but then we hoped it didn't. We got to see how happy they were, but also how Eun-Gyeol had such many difficulties.I was so concerned when, he began likin Se-Kyung , since it was in the 1990's, so I was extremely relieved when she also turned out to be a time traveler.It was also nice to see that they didn't figure it out in the first couple of seconds. Even after she took her moms place, Eun-Gyeol didn't notice. I really liked that.The end of the series was a bit depressing, but also necessary. We of course always knew, that Eun-Gyeol had to go home and that he couldn't stay in 1995 with his father. It made me so sad to think, that he had to leave his whole friend group behind, and i was so scared to see the ""Real"" world and how i turned out. We now of course know i turned out amazing, but it just felt a little rushed.The scene where he looks at his mother and his friends and remember them as teenagers literally made me bawl my eyes out. I really wished, we would have known what the others thought when they just disappeared. And after Eun-Gyeol dropped the thing with the song on?!All of this to say that, i loved this so much. I really has become one of my comfort series of all time. And yes, i really would like a season two, thank you very much! S2.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

All at once I just realised I completed the series.So the thought that went through my mind the whole time I was watching each episode was ,if it was just a normal people living in real world and someone unknowingly captured everything. Actors were acting they came straight from the real life. I assumed many times as if the writer just had a long dream and decided to make it into a series.Surprisingly first episode had cry like a baby.

I love time travel themed shows, and this one was such a heart warming story, of family, love, friendship, dreams, love and loyalty! I loved all the characters, especially the ones from 1995, and I felt the dilemma, confusion, happiness and sadness with every character, especially the ML, right with him. The actress who played Cheong-Ah in 1995 was super cute and I simply loved her innocence and expressions. One discovered that the disability of the ML's dad was not congenital, rather due to an accident at the age of 18, but even if it was 1995, hearing aids were available to people who could speak but just couldn't hear. I mean one can understand how Beethoven became deaf and couldn't be treated in the 1700s, but it is beyond me why Ha Yi Chan couldn't be given a hearing aid!

But I wish they got more screen time. But asiide from that this is such a good drama.

The story was also very self-contained; a second season wouldn't fit at all.In the end, although you didn't really get to see Lee Chan work through his deafness with the help of Cheong Ah, which definitely should have been added, I feel like it wrapped up all of the major plot points very well.I will say I was a little disappointed that Eun Gyeol's life had changed so drastically when he went back to the future. Personally, I thought his life was already pretty good. It would have been more satisfying to see his parents as normal people, but very happy and with many more people in their lives. Just my personal feeling though. I think they did an amazing job with the music, the characters, and the feel of the story and would have changed very little.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

All people related to us aren't mere side characters in our life, they have their own life in which we are the side characters for them. We can't live their life for them. Nor can they do so for us.

I loveeee choi hyun wook and he slayed this role. Also the FL was amazing, her role was challenging but she slayed it and her sign language was beautiful and i really felt bad for her character as she was amazing in showing her emotions through her eyes and sign language.Second: when I watched this drama I felt like I was on a rollercoaster of emotions, you feel sad , happy, and you this drama feels like home.The relationship of Ml with his grandmother is very loving💕.Also one last thing I would like to add is the scene when the ML is deaf and his grandmother comes to see him but since he can't hear her he can't answer her so he pretends to ask her questions......oh my i bawled my eyes out ....i felt the pain in my heart(literally) ...so definitely a must watch<3.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The visuals, cinematography, ost everything just seemed perfect.I do feel that it has few flaws here and there - like how chung ah's father was unaware of the cruel treatment she'd been receiving, and chung ah being unnecessarily rude in scenes few scenes, etc. But it's fine the story overall is so serene and uplifting that you don't really care about these.The ending is bittersweet for sure, but it's still nice and satisfactory ( don't worry it's not gonna rip your heart unlike twenty five twenty one :p )",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt13274038,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020/2021 South Korean television drama with 16, 73 minute episodes. Lim Ju-kyung (Moon Ga-young), feels like she was cursed as the only ugly child among her siblings. As somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy her vision of herself and lack of confidence has led to bullying at school and less than kind comments even at home. Looking for a solution she stumbles upon internet makeup videos and learns to expertly hide her cosmetic flaws just Asher family moves and she transfers schools. The makeup enhances what is Ju-kyung's underlying beauty and her new schoolmates think she is beautiful, like a goddess. Her newfound confidence is fragile and she is determined no one at her new school ever see her bare face. A mutual love of heavy metal type music and horror comics leads Ju-kyung and her extraordinarily handsome classmate, Lee Su-ho (Cha Eun-woo), to cross paths when Ju-kyung is not wearing makeup. Ju-kyung is convinced that the difference is dramatic enough Su-ho will not connect the Goddess with the ugly duckling she thinks she is without makeup. It is not long though before Su-oh realizes it is the same girl and Ju-kyung strikes a bargain with Su-oh to keep her secret. Su-ho and his former friend Han Seo-jun (Hwang In-yeop) had a falling out over a tragic incident in their past. At first Seo-jun pays attention to Ju-kyung to bother Su-oh but soon discovers he also likes the beautiful and sweet
Ju-kyung. The boys grow closer as they rival each other for the girl's attention and begin to learn about and resolve issues from their past. Will Ju-kyung realize her true potential and gain confidence even without makeup? Spoilers**I absolutely loved this drama, every minute of it. The casting was near perfect as they looked so much like the Manga characters. There was a strong social message about bullying and the detrimental effects on self esteem. I liked how she found solace in the transformative power of make-up. I would have happily had her end up with either 1st or second guy. I loved her sister and her confident p, go for it, tomboy attitude. The way her little brother and her constantly teased, scuffled and irritated each other but, when the chips were down, they were the first to jump to their siblings defense. Su-ho was handsome and popular and seemed to have it all but his mother died at a young age and a misunderstanding had him estranged from his famous father. Su-ho and Seo-jun and Su-ho used to be friends but a tragic event caused a seemingly insurmountable rift to form between the two friends. It also explored the very deep topic of suicide and the lasting impact it has on the loved ones of the person who ended their own life. Love and friendship builds up Ju-kyung to the point she is no longer afraid of the bullies nor her unmade up face. I did not follow the web too but my daughter explained and showed me relevant parts. She said it was a perfect balance of following the Webtoon to capture what made it a success while departing, as needed, to make it work wel, in a shorter format.

Great acting by both eunwoo and ga young but her character was annoying at times especially knowing her insecurities were mainly related to her acne and she thought the only way to hide them was to wear makeup, not go to a dermatologist and fix it but wear makeup everyday to school and make it even worse. It made no sense. The real star of the show was definitely in youp, great acting and you find yourself rooting for him throughout the whole thing. He truly had the best character development delivered in the best way possible, he better get a main role soon because he got potential.

tt13274038,"This highly anticipated show has an over the top sometimes almost painful exaggerated style. It's not as funny as it should be sometimes. Maybe the source material is like that. Not sure the premise about the make up no make up difference holds up. She isn't that ugly with the glasses and no makeup to be bullied for it and she isn't that stunning with makeup. The message about looks mattering so much seems awkwardly handled. Although with the romance picking up it is getting more interesting and the backstory about the suicide. The love triangle is promising. This show doesn't take itself too seriously but compared to similar shows I prefer 18 Again and Gangnam Beauty in terms if their tone and approach. Things get slightly better as the episodes progress. Episode 6 is quite funny.
The cast are well chosen and suit their roles in appearance. Moon Ga Young is enthusiastic and does well considering. Cha Eun Woo looks like a WEBTOON character come to life. Hwang In Yeop has an also comic book look. The grown ups are pretty top actors. Like Seo Dan's mom from CLOY Jang Hye Jin as her mom and SKY Castle's Jung Joon Ho as his Dad.
OK for a teen show with a good cast.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

He's always been the most popular fan-cast for Suho and I was so happy when I found out he was cast, although I did think Suho is too similar to his character in My ID is Gangnam Beauty. Even the plot is similar, but the character of Han Seojun made everything better.I do think some scene are cringey, especially with the editing. Moon Gayoung's acting gets cringey and overacting too, but I think the director/s just wanted her to do something similar to the webtoon version, so it's not really her fault. Inyeop is probably the best in the cast, and his character is also the best among the three mains. Eunwoo also improved from his acting in Gangnam and Rookie Historian, but the lack of range in these 3 shows doesn't give him justice.The series tackled very serious topics about depression, but it was only used for the love triangle purposes. It saddens me because it's such a pivotal part in Suho and Seojun's friendship. Had it been taken seriously, I would have liked this series better.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"They have not dived deep in the plot of what true beauty is, instead they are glorifying beautiful by being an outer appearance, not one person has mentioned she should stop wearing makeup because it doesn't define beauty, and show definitely has too many cringy moments , so unrealistic.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It is so funny, so wonderful cheesy and the message is beautiful.I know it is far away from reality, but which romantic kdrama is realistic???I watched it in less than 36 hours and now I am rewatching it because it is addictive! Hilarious, touching, romantic and the cast is fantastic!!This will be a modern classic!!",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,The love triangle in this series created some of the best funny moments I have ever seen. The romance was definitely a highlight for this series.

The side story about the trio and bromance, I couldn't fathom enough about how they made this plot so much interesting and the cliffhangers, especially the preview for the next episodes!!! I really like the editors of this show! Also the Easter eggs from Extraordinary you were on point! Right amount of emotions, drama and comedy!

tt13274038,"This is honestly now one of my fave tv shows and probably my favourite korean drama. I wasn't too interested initially as it seemed like a typical high school drama with cringey predictable plot and I actually stopped watching it after episode 1 in January because it seemed very predictable but I was very wrong.But then I started watching it again in Sept and OMG I BINGED WATCHED THE WHOLE THING IN THE ONE WEEKEND BECAUSE IT BECAME SO INTERESTING.Cha Eun Woo really shines here. His acting is amazing and his character development is brilliant. He goes from being cold to warm but in a genuinely believable way. Moon Ka Young and Hwang In Yeop really bring a lot of charisma and high energy to the table. The secondary characters are hilarious and you become just as invested in their stories as the main leads.Highly, highly recommend you watch this as the plot becomes very emotional and you will laugh, cry and be angry at the same time.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"At first I was a little annoyed that the concept was overplayed, but the writing and the character development of all the characters, not just the main ones, was what really drew me into this drama.The ending was one of the most fulfilling endings I've seen in a K drama in a long time. It really allowed you to feel satisfied, rather than the ""well what the hell did I waste my time on that for?"" that you quite often get left with.Absolutely recommend it. I particularly enjoyed the storylines of the secondary characters.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"I'm a little late to finish the show but I absolutely loved it. The original webtoon did include a lot more but I like the way they were able to keep some of the stuff from the original while adding their own little twist to it. This show can be corny at times but I like it, it feels like an actual comic story. The romance is well developed and really good. I like how they displayed the message of loving yourself. The makeup the character wore wasn't the problem; the problem was that we didn't love how she looked without it. The show is about learning to accepting who you are. This show not only had funny scenes but a lot of emotional ones as well. I do recommend if you'd like to watch a fun well written romance comedy drama.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"This K-Drama is certainly not amazing. The lack of character development from the main character is irritating. In general, she isn't that lovable. She doesn't come to terms with anything and she doesn't help herself either.Sohoo isn't bad, he's the regular reserved heartthrob, but he comes off as a bit emotionless to me. I wasn't a big fan as I'm not into this type of guys but he was cute for the most part.Seo-Jun had the best character development and personality. He was attractive and had a lot to offer. But in my opinion, he deserves someone better than Ju Kyung.Selena! I loved her! Sassiness but controlling, yet fair and direct. I would ONLY watch a season 2 if it included a make up artist - idol relationship with her and seojun!Something I have to mention, I enjoyed the side stories. Which isn't usual sometimes they can be a bore. But I loved the sister so much! She was one of the best characters in this show. Her relationship with the teacher is so cute.Overall, it's not a bad drama. It's worth a watch if you don't mind tropes and cheesy stuff. I was going to give it a 5, but that's kinda low and a 7 is too high.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt13274038,"The beginning of the show was too cringe with the ""ugly"" looks with thickened eyebrows... And the female lead always falling and stuff.And why all the guys in korean dramas are too possessive... But what I liked is that she is defending herself much more in the drama then the webtoon. Also the big sister is awesome in the drama! She's not the cliché female character and her husband at the end is so cute and emotional. I think it's really good to break gender stereotypes like that.Another bad thing is one of the less interesting character is the female lead in my opinion. Also she never rails about what she likes about Suho and Seo-jun personality wise... Everything about her is superficial, she only cares about her appereance. The show criticiezd superficiality but act superficial. The guys are just ""handsome"" and they bring that up all the time !What I really didn't like is that in the webtoon this is really a love triangle, in the drama not really, towards the end we see less and less of Seo-jun. He makes lots of sacrifices for her, he respects Suho and doesn't even say how he réels by respect. Then Suho goes and when he comes back it's like he never left...
Now I am comming to the biggest problem for me at the show. There are no consequences to anything that happened. Every character ended up with their high school sweetheart. Even her best friend that broie up 16 times with her boyfriend got back together. The relationship of her mom and her dad nothing changed either even if she was beating up her husband! Un my opinion it normalizes toxic relationship.So there is nothing really changed except Seo-jun who sings again.The interesting thing about growing up is that things changes, but in the drama it feels like nobody really grow up.Finally, we had so little moments with Seo-jun, there was no more a love triangle but a second character that comes sometimes to make Suho jelous. She was never really in love with him or never had hard time to choose. And that was just boring and sad because personally I thought that Seo-jun was a much more realistic and friendly character. He showed us a more friendly and warm kind of love. And why they always end with the rich guy omg ! He was one of the most interesting characther in the show and they didn't even uses him.I hope there will be a second season which this time things really change and people grow up and fix the problems. And I hope we will see more of Seo-jun and they will end Up together.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt13274038,"This was a fun romance with a fun love triangle. The two guys vying for the affection of one girl was a lot of fun to watch. But when the love triangle involving the girls arrives, that's when it gets vicious and cruel. At the Crux of it all I feel like it's girls being jealous of other girls. This is a story about self-esteem and inner strength. And also loving yourself for who you are no matter what.The part that confused me about this show is that the central character was it ugly at all. She wasn't ugly without makeup and she wasn't as beautiful as they claimed she was with it. In fact I thought she looked better without the makeup. And I'm not just saying that. I thought she looked too much like the other girls with the makeup. The way they were carrying on you would have thought she was a monster and even without makeup she was prettier than most of the other girls in the school. What she was lacking was courage and self-esteem. So for me I found it hard to suspend belief that a pretty young lady is supposed to be ugly simply because she has pimples on her face. Or that it is criminal or even deceitful to wear makeup. But the show is handled well and I think it has a good message with the protagonist caring about her no matter how she looked. Su
Ho is a guy who sees beyond the superficial unlike everyone else. To me he was mature in a well-rounded character despite his mood swings and struggles with his past. Also Seo Jun sees beyond the superficial because of the tragedy with their friend and their own history with seeing what bullying does to another human being.I felt the mother of Im Gyeong was very insensitive to her daughter. There is no way I would allow anyone to say that my daughter is ugly or unattractive. I would probably bite their heads off. Her mother did not create empowerment in her daughter by allowing people in the community to point out her features and call her unattractive. So the girl never really learned how to defend herself. Other than those quibbles the story was also a lot of fun and had a lot of hilarious moments that I enjoyed. I typically don't watch any shows centered around the lives of teenagers. I tend to find those shows very annoying. At times the kids on the show were hyperactive so I took breaks between binge watching so that it didn't wear on my nerves. But I would rank this show in my top 10 kdramas.I really liked how the two young men were very supportive of Im Gyeong throughout. The bullies were all ridiculous and despicable. And I really wanted them to have a severe comeuppance. I wanted Im Gyeong to stand up to them and grow a spine. I enjoyed the subplots and other love stories.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I know the series wants to stay true to the webtoon but it's not really necessary most of the time. The plot has very serious and deep aspects to it which the series had would sometimes turn comedic, especially with the topic of bullying, depression, and suicide.

tt13274038,"Korean Drama ""True Beauty"" based on a webtoon and with a fresh and comical mood, gives a light school love story with not many surprises and a pretty basic plot.First of all, the drama nailed the atmosphere, settings and costumes for this series. The comic book shop and the girl's room, especially, were created with such detail that they were nice to watch.The bromance was pretty entertaining as well. The two male leads had chemistry and they provided a lot of funny moments. The start of the drama was interesting as well, with some intense moments and dramatic twists. There were some funny scenes in this drama as well, and the second couple were really cute!However, the rest of it was average. The love triangle was weak, with the second lead being interesting in her towards the middle of the length, and even then the female lead didn't seem to notice him at all. The main love story, on the other hand, was okay, but it was predictable and that twist in the end was boring and aged.The rest of the story was also predictable and boring towards the ending.So, overall, six and a half out of ten.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Having no character development is a big no-no for me.Another bad thing is how it delved too far away from the webtoon where it originated.

However, it still comes off a cute romantic comedy drama that is not exactly a 'must-watch' but a potential 'can-watch'.Lim Joo-Kyung is bullied for her looks - just a puffed up face and a few acnes make her 'ugly' and in desperation to survive, she learns the art of makeup which truly transforms her face - the make up artists have done a phenomenal job in this.Now 'beautiful', Jo-Kyung struggles to keep her secret under the wraps as the two most popular guys of the school start to hit on her, and thanks to her beauty, she is literally called goddess.Excluding the re-enforcement of gender stereotypes in K Dramas, True Beauty is not a pain to watch. I'm actually quite impressed by how many ideas they come up with in each episode to keep us hooked on the screen.Sometimes some scenes feel repetitive and some, unnecessary but none of that made me quit the show though except for the last two episodes - they really tried to pull a 'friends' moment there and failed terribly.To conclude, True Beauty is a drama which you can watch every day to get past your boring evenings, nothing more, nothing less.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
tt13274038,"It's rather curious that two recent kdramas that try to mock society's obsession with external beauty - My ID Is Gangnam Beauty and True Beauty - both star probably the best-looking kdrama actor today, Cha Eun Woo. His characters in both dramas are also similar - aloof with other people but passionate and faithful when it comes to the object of their affection. My kind of leading man. So I don't mind him being type-casted in this role. It suits him and it's always a treat to watch him onscreen.In True Beauty, Lim Ju Kyung (Moon Ga-young) gets bullied for being ugly in her school. Fortunately, her family moves to another area and she gets the opportunity to start over in new surroundings. She covers up her ugliness with makeup and becomes popular in her new school where she gets entangled with the school heartthrob Lee Su Ho (Cha Eun Woo). But she becomes utterly fearful of her bare-face being found out. Frankly, I don't see the big deal about this as a lot of women cover their imperfections with makeup. Also, it seems her only problem is her skin. If she can spend all that money on makeup and even consider having plastic surgery, why not just focus her efforts on taking care of her skin?In any case, despite the rather flimsy reason for much of Ju Kyung's grief in the drama, that is, her ugliness being found out, the drama is entertaining, with several funny scenes including parodies of other dramas like The King Eternal Monarch and Crash Landing On You. The romance, which becomes a triangle, is heartwarming.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I wished Junkyung learned something and find some courage to show her bare-face by episode 7 or 8 to her close circle but the story went on in a tone that suggest its okay to hide yourself behind an unrealistic layer of makeup. It seems the only people who were transformed were the supporting characters like Sujin and Seojun and even Junkyung siblings. The collateral overwhelmed the core, and that was a disappointment.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Soo Ho is so basic, all he does is smile and look cute. Soo Ho and Ju Jyung's characters were so boring IMO. If she liked all this horror/grunge/rock stuff, they shoulda made her look and act the part at least.Still finished it. I only shed some tears when the mom found out she was bullied.

I laughed out loud so many times, I think it's the funniest K-drama I've seen yet. I loved the characters, who started off very tropey but pleasantly surprised me by upending those tropes. The characters all seemed REAL. And some of the things they did weren't good, a lot were downright awful, but at least the writing mostly allowed the audience to understand the motivations and emotions involved in the characters' decisions. For the most part the relationships between the characters were intriguing and realistic, and the drama of their interactions seemed natural and not the forced, drama-for-drama's sake business which I hate. There were a couple, or where jarring silliness pulled me out of the story, but they were minor points I could ignore.Wonderful and heart warming, this show takes its audience on A JOURNEY and it's one I'll definitely be taking again.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This drama teaches that a person should be loved for the soul, and not for the appearance. The scriptwriters showed the audience how those who mock others look from the outside. It looked really terrible. I felt hatred for the offenders. Love is also shown here sincerely. But the love triangle is bad. Breaks hearts, I would say.

tt13274038,"As someone who has been following the Webtoon, I initially tried to compare the plotline and character arcs as I watched the 'live action', and I'm glad I quickly decided it's plain counter-productive (not to mention a setup for disappointment) to do this kind of cross-media comparison anyway.After all, professionally speaking, it would be quite unfair and unrealistic to expect the 'live action' adaptation to strictly follow the backstory, plot development and all the character relationships as per the original Webtoon; I'm glad this 'live action' showcased a screenplay and direction that is rather unique in its own right.Here are the main questions I took into consideration as I watched this series:
1. Does the overall story carry its own weight? YES (it addresses the theme of ""true beauty"" quite consistently; watch this as a standalone, so no need to read the webtoon to get anything; also, backstories, side stories and character relationships in the show are more dynamic and interesting compared to the source material)
2. Is the plot well-developed? YES (no terribly unforgiveable plotholes or too many drag-in-the-mud moments)
3. Are the characters well-portrayed? YES (the casting was really well done overall; key characters are all relatable enough and the chemistry believable; I must say that there's pretty good development in the two male lead characters unlike in the webtoon)
4. Bingeworthy? YES (quite well-paced and well-timed cliffhangers; best devoured over long weekends)
5. Sentimental level? Low to moderate; campy in a good, entertaining way (you have the Kdrama tropes but they're not too-cringey that they detract from the story progression)
6. Re-watch-ability? High (Execution-wise, it's one of the better Kdramas that qualifies for the hall of classics)
7. Major complaints? Some emo moments are unnecessarily drawn out, with some gratuitous montage or filler moments (which feel like time wasters) but hey, this is Kdrama!
8. Does this series need a Season 2? NO; the story is not perfectly written it fits the purpose and most of the plotlines have come to a full circle quite nicely.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

tt13274038,"I know people like to call romance-oriented dramas ""guilty pleasures,"" but I prefer to think of True Beauty as comfort food. It has all the familiar tropes of older kdramas, but it always knows how to put a fun new spin on them in order to keep viewers engaged and interested.
Lim Jugyeong is a wonderful female lead, brought to life perfectly by Moon Gayoung, and her growth over the course of 16 episodes is believable and rootable. Cha Eunwoo, aside from being eye candy, gives his all to Lee Suho and really makes you feel pain and his love for Jugyeong.
Hwang Inyeop and Park Yoona may be treated very differently by the narrative in their respective second lead positions, but they are delightful and help round out a perfect cast.
In fact, every major character is memorable and exciting, with some twist or extra infusion to make them stand out from the high school drama pack. There are also fun dream sequences, bliss-tastic OST choices, and plenty of ""restaurant ending"" scene moments to go around.

tt13274038,"True Beauty is a teen romance I put off watching for a while, as I sometimes find high-school dramas to be too immature. I was well aware of the show while it aired, and so I knew how the story was going to turn out. That being said, it was easy to see why so many people got SLS, as Soo-Ho was an extremely un-likeable character, while Seo Jun was a dork with a bad boy image that was very endearing. Ju-Kyung was easily the best character in the show, well written and well acted. It was clearly ridiculous that she was considered ""ugly"" with no make-up as Moon Ga-Young is very pretty, but I understood the sentiment. They gave very little screen time to the SML, which was disappointing as he was the more interesting of the two MLs in my opinion. There were a lot of un-likeable characters in this, but honestly I think that was fine because it felt realistic - teenagers do behave like the characters in the show, so I just allowed myself to enjoy the ride. The show handles the 16 episode time-span well, the story filled all 16 episodes and did not feel dragged out. The bully plot-line was well done and often difficult to watch, although the sound-effects/music often made scenes feel heavy handed. The show is absolutely chock-full of cliche's, but they were woven into the show in a way that felt organic and fun. There is not really anything original here in a rom-com k-drama, but it still felt worth the watch. I adored the older sister's plot line, she was easily the coolest character.Overall this was a decent watch and I enjoyed it quite a bit. A 6.5 rounded up to a 7.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I hate one thing about this Drama , why our Han Seo-Jun didn't got his true love, i know it was one sided and you can do nothing in it, but still producer should also give him his love by introducing to another female candidate, I love his character the most, even from the main two couple leads, His heart was pure, he just sacrificed his love for his love (Kim Ju-Kyung), to let go your love isn't always easy, and i actually shows empathy for me.

I liked the plot its not a very extraordinary story but the actors did justice to their characters. Also rooting for team HAN SEO JUN.. will i ever get over them? No, but life goes on. Han seo Jun's acting was way better than suho when it comes to expressions & reactions. My heart also pumped for team suho and jugyeong. I heard it's based on webtoon and webtoon is way better than this version of drama, read people venting about how writer did not do justice to seo jun character and honestly i was shouting running around my house when i read seo jun and jugyeong dated in webtoon , would have loved to watched that in drama but i am sure they did justice to seo Jun's character in drama too. They were trying to show him as a bad boy but actually he was the softest bad boy ever in k drama history with zero toxicity. How he respected jugyeong , keeps joking around her, respecting her boundaries i mean he could totally steal jugyeong from suho but instead he was always by her side even before her face was revealed and after too, meanwhile getting his heart ripped off. Proved himself a great friend to suho, totally a green flag!Suho is also a green flag and honestly he deserved jugyeong (why it's also introvert male lead with an extrovert female lead anyways).Loved the character of jugyeong her humor ,her transformation and finally in the end, accepting her self, leading her way into her most passion. She deserved the all the encouragement from her school and family which she received
jugyeong father's character was on point!Over all if you are willing to watch a k drama with no typical twists , light weight, rom-com so you should definitely go for it.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The acting Cha Eun-woo's'[Lee Su-ho' acting had no emotion I couldn't tell if he was happy ,sad or angry which made the drama a little bit confusing hopefully he can improve on his emotions while acting. The person she choose, in the end her and Su-ho were together personally I did not ship them as they were to much the same but if she choose Han Seo-jun he would always cheer her up,make her feel safe and love her.

This adaptation goes into much more detail with side characteres and gives them a much bigger spotlight rather than focusing only on Jugyeong like in the Webtoon. The comedy is just brilliant and I found myself laughing out loud almost all the time while watching this show! It's also one of the few shows where I actually felt sad and almost teared up a bit when they showed sad and dramatic moments. They don't overdo it, but when they do make something sad, it has real impact rather than making me want to fast forward through the entire scene. It's nothing super complex, but the characters and fun interactions will just make you want to keep watching forever.

There is great music throughout especially the song that is the main song of the drama, and good talent singing it. 2 guys falling for the same girl rival for her but one relationship is one-sided the whole time. The sour thing that I don't really like is that suicide is brought into the drama. Also, didn't particularly like in this drama or other drama's for that matter that have the main lead leaves for years and then comes back. Never cared for that type of scripting- 2 years later...... and then the story gets continued. Took off 2 stars for the 2 years.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It was original, the fact that, for once the second character get a development was unusual , the main character was adorable , original and I was craving for more episodes. They were plot twist you don't often see and it felt more down to earth than other webtoon or drama. I was so excited when I learned about the drama and started it full of hope and joy... and what a disappointment. They change all the little things that made me attached to the characters. They transformed it into another boring drama where you can easily predict the end. And I keep asking myself ""why?"" They just had to follow the webtoon... i'm so sad , the casting was great and the drama was pretty... so why?

Loved SuJeon more , he reminded of Lee jong gi alot , especially the eyes, his acting and character were top notch, i think the show should have ended on episode 14, after it peaked, that she learned to overcome her bullies and finally accepted herself . The last two episodes were totally unnecessary , why on earth would you break up with her if you were taking care of your ill father, could ve kept in contact, i wanted the show to explore this kind of support, it aint always romance and flowers, loved the phone-call that Lim ju keong's mother had with SuHoo about how he s fairing, they could've shown a wonderful side to it, but instead it went down the drain for just a stupid twist and to allow the audience to explore her relationship with SuJeon. Could ve been done differently or from the beginning when they became friends, how they handled it didn't make any sense, felt like fillers. Only continued watching coz i loved the show so much.

Unlike most kdrama heroines, she is not the typical pretty girl which I'm sure is like most of us! I know for a fact that there is no way in any of the seven seas that I fit any beauty standard anywhere. True Beauty teaches us that it's okay to be not okay, it's okay to fall down and stare at the sky hopelessly, but it's unhealthy to live on the ground forever.The scene where Jugyeong walked into school bare-faced, when she was scared,afraid and nervous but still smiled anyways, I was so proud of her until at some point I realised that Jugyeong is me. Jugyeong is you. Jugyeong is each and everyone of us, who have faced obstacles, who have faced people telling us we don't belong and we can still go on. In facing her worst nightmare, Jugyeong has achieved her greatest dream which is acceptance where it matters. Acceptance from her true friends and loved ones.

tt13274038,"*I haven't read the webtoon so everything I'm gonna say refers to the drama only*The plot isn't that special and this drama is full of clichés and exaggerations to the point that I rolled my eyes quite a lot and scenes that were supposed to be funny weren't funny at all because they were just too ridiculous.As the drama develops, the number of exaggerated and ridiculous scenes thankfully decreases a bit and I really started enjoying the show.And here's the but:In retrospect, I gotta admit that there's a pretty high chance I was so invested in this drama because of the cast. They're all very talented and have faces to swoon over (even the supporting roles!!!) and I just couldn't stop staring at them plus I'm a big fan of the main trio. I love Moon Gayeong and Cha Eunwoo and despite his small role as a supporting character Hwang In Yeop really cought my attention in the Tale of Nokdu.
All three of them had great chemistry with each other and just seeing their characters interacting with each other was good enough for me. The plot really took a backseat.As for the message of the show, in my opinion they really failed at displaying it. I'm sure they meant to bring across that no one can define your beauty but yourself and that confidence and self-love and self-acceptance is the key but instead they glorified makeup and made it seem like cosmetics solve your problem with bullies but kids, that ain't it!!! Especially not if you have the face of Moon Gayeong. Not even acne skin can make her truly ugly.And the way they put characters with beautiful faces on a pedestal and seeing everyone around them glorifying the ""beauties"" like popstars was really sickening.Conclusion:
Good drama with awesome characters, plot lacks originality and is full of clichés and ridiculous exaggerations, failed at bringing the message of the drama across",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Can Eun-Woo, Huang In-Youp, Park Yoo-Na were great! Super casting.But what makes this one of the ***best RomComs ever*** is Moon Ga-Young. Her performance is just insanely good. The subtle voicing, the expressions, the range of emotions (from giddy to traumatic) - utter perfection. Simply put no actor could do better. Then only performance I can compare it to is Yoo In-Na in Touch Your Heart, which also was perfection and basically untouchable. TYH as a drama wins out because of the overall story and the performance and chemistry with Lee Dong-Wook. So a huge shout-out to Moon Ga-Young. She made this laugh-out load hilarious and so captivating. Oh, yeah, and she is beautiful on top of all that talent.The story is fun, and cute, and holds your attention from start to finish. And of course this drama has an important, positive message. The full package, for sure.Mild spoilers alert.Here are my only negative thoughts:
It is super frustrating to wait for Lee Woo-Ho (Cha Sun-Woo) to express his feelings. Argh!I HATE HATE love triangles, but give the writers credit for Han Seo-Jun's manning up (so to speak) and realizing it was not to be. Hwang In-Youp pulled this off with great aplomb.The KDrama trope of things falling apart near the end, only to be rescued at the last minute.

I recently binged through all six episodes, and I must say, I was hooked from the get-go. While the detectives may make some questionable decisions in certain episodes, it's possible the creator intended for us to see the story unfold from the unique perspective of the female lead - a half-parasyte and half-human girl - navigating the complexities of our human world. Despite these minor hiccups, the show remains a thrilling ride from start to finish, making it well worth a watch.""The cast delivered stellar performances, with a dash of humor courtesy of the male lead. What's great is that even if you're new to the ""Parasyte"" universe, you can easily jump into ""The Grey"" without feeling lost. The series cleverly introduces the alien invasion storyline through a detective's eyes, offering a refreshing take on the familiar concept.While the aliens' goal remains the same - wiping out humanity - the plot takes unexpected twists and turns that kept me on edge. It's exciting to see the universe expanding in new and surprising ways. I have a strong feeling a second season is on the horizon, given the show's success and fan enthusiasm.I accidentally started watching in Tamil, my native language, and it added an unexpectedly funny touch to the whole experience. The climax was a real nail-biter, blending action, suspense, and intrigue seamlessly.

tt21874396,"I have an understandable fear when it comes to anime live action adaptation, especially when we talk about shows where CGI is required, but this was executed relatively well.The story is good, but not perfect. It can be seen that it uses similar topics compared to the original, when the series elaborate on what being a human means, but the series definitely made those topics its own with its own plot points. Pacing-wise - because the story tries to be a bit more complex at certain points - the first half can feel a bit slow.For the characters, the main cast is much more unique personality-wise. Like from acting you could tell who has a bigger role in the series. I wouldn't call it bad and it made the characters interesting and less boring, but sometimes it was like that the main cast are the players in a game and everyone else is an NPC. The main cast was good and their characters felt real and developed with the story.About the technical aspects, the sound directing and OST were good. Nothing exceptional, but worked perfectly.Directing and editing, again it was good overall, nothing exceptional. There was one really good chase scene without a single cut.About the CGI and effects, errr... it look good, there was maybe one scene where it looked a bit funny, but even in daylight it looked okay. One little complaint maybe about the blood. They surprisingly low amount of blood. I mean people got beheaded and there wasn't a lot of blood there.And I would say the weakest part was the choreography. When it comes to normal hand to hand or weapon to weapon combat there are some really good scene out there. We spent decades on creating good looking fights, but here they should have developed a new fight, because the parasites head could shapeshift into a tentacle monster. I believe they failed to do that.In many cases, while the tentacle fights look cool in a close up, but from a bit afar it looks like they are tied to bodies and their bodies don't do anything just stand there. Imagine a rock with a tentacle, the rock sits in one place while the tentacle fight.They could have came up with some more unique or interesting fights.All in all, good to watch, at least once. It is not as good as the original anime, but not as bad as I was expected to be.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"I came into this expecting a live action adaptation of the manga/anime, but they ended up using new characters and a new setting to tell a different story. At first I was just going to cut the show off, but I decided to give it a chance and honestly..It's not bad. They stick to the rules that were developed inside of the book and show pretty well, the only thing that concerned me was the head swapping. There is 1 parasite that swaps bodies a lot but in the source material, swapping bodies was regarded as pretty dangerous. I also don't understand why they'd swap bodies when they had the ability to change the way their faces looked in the book/show.I'm not a film critic and I am not going to pretend to be like other reviewers. The show is a decent watch for fans of the series. It's not as deep in terms of philosophy and character development as the book/show but it's a good time passer. If you've never seen the source material, the show might seem a little goofy.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

It does not follow the typical k-drama tropes, no cheesy humor, no sexy male anti-hero, no deaths just to squeeze some tears from the viewer. It's a smart, gritty, no-nonsense crime/scifi drama that wastes no time in moving the story forward.The two lead cast members are extremely likeable. Neither of them are particularly charismatic but the viewer will naturally gravitate towards their vulnerability and their willingness of accepting their place among the bottom rungs of society.Acting is consistently good throughout and avoids the typical melodrama you'd find in the same genre.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

The designs of the characters and their surroundings is unique and plays a role throughout the show. Everything in the show is intertwined and in the end the plot is naturally engaging without any over the top elements.

I did not think for a second that telling a different story in that universe would be as impactful, and maybe it won't fully be when it is over. But this starts absolutely fantastic. From the music, the camera work, the acting, the effects, the twist in how the mutation work. I just hope this manages to touch on some of the big questions that the original anime did. So far it is very promising to where it leads.

The rest of us who aren't, may not be able to look past the bad CGI, funny head-banging everytime parasytes fight while it can never be clear who managed to inflict anything. Must be embarassing for the actors involved.I was looking forward to another creature feature from the Korean creators that I usually enjoy, while waiting for Gyeongsong Creature season 2, but was disappointed.Patchy flow of events, mostly unlikeable characters, too fake-looking of creatures, unbelievable coincidences/logic, like seriously even civilians' cars have dash cams but someone can get away killing a police asset while being surrounded by parked police cars.The most cringe though, has got to be the team leader lady. Her acting sucks, it baffles me why she was chosen when there's no shortage of good Korean actresses. Over the top acting, screeching voice, condescending tone, with weak back story not enough to justify her behavior.Four stars for how meh this show is but I'll add two extra stars because it's still better than watching Hollywood garbage loaded with stewpid propaganda.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"As someone who saw the anime almost a decade ago, which was an adaptation of a manga by the same name, I was very curious how this story could possibly be adapted into live action without looking very silly (see the Japanese live adaptation films).Without spoiling anything, The Grey is not another live-adaptation of the manga, nor is it a sequel to it. It's more like a spin-off. The events that happen in Parasyte, in the original material, we only saw what happened in Japan. The Grey looks at what happens when the parasytes affects a different country. In this sense, you don't have to read the manga or watch the anime, as the TV series cover the worldbuilding fairly well.Now, the big question is, did it end up looking as silly as the films? No. I'd say the special effects in The Grey were awesome. Probably the best parts of the show. It will no doubt look a bit cartoonish still but I was very impressed. How much of it was practical effects? How much was it VFX? They have blended it very well.However, the shaky cam definitely didn't do the show any favours. Maybe it was a necessary evil to make the VFX looks as real as it did, but I rather have the camera stationary so we can focus on the fights, because some of the fights were pretty insane. But again, it might be because the cuts and shaky cams hid a lot of glaring issues and is why it was used.Still, Parasyte was and still is an interesting series just because it asks some interesting questions about humanity, survival, and morality. I don't think the philosophy was as in-depth as the manga or anime, given there were only 6 episodes, but there is enough to ponder here and definitely makes me want to watch the anime again (highly recommended but also has its fair share of flaws). For those who knew the source material, the last couple minutes in this show was super cool to see.In summary, Parasyte has an interesting premise and the TV series did an excellent job adapting it as a live action. Slowly, I think Netflix is producing more and more quality live adaptations which had been known for a long time to be a joke (Cowboy Bebop and Death Note is still a joke but Alice in Wonderland and One Piece was very good).",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"This South Korean show is like a violent gangsters/police/military version of The Host (which also featured an alien turncoat). It's reasonably well-acted and paced. I like the characters, although some are under-developed. The premise is ridiculous but sufficiently interesting to hold one's attention (the high-quality CGI helps). The ending is appropriate and satisfying.For those who haven't seen the anime (and gotten certain expectations), this show is fine -- if you don't think about it too much, and just enjoy the ride. There are some memorable scenes.There are plenty of technical/plot/logic flaws (as some reviewers have noted). Just one of these small parasites can devour your brain in seconds and then control your body in frightening ways. This film makes John Carpenter's THE THING look entirely plausible by comparison.I give this eight stars, with a one-star penalty for lack-of-plausibility (see the negative reviews for details).

As a live action it excels (better than the live actions for my taste), also the animation is quite good when depicting the parasites. Regarding the plot it keeps you engaged every episode. While it is not a remake of the original story it remains in essence like the original manga and anime (unlike other recent anime/cartoon adaptations of netflix). I hope netflix keeps this level of good work. The 8 out of ten is because there was some cringy moments here and there but thats expected on korean series.For people who hasn't seen the original material Ill recommend to check that first as this is basically a well made spin-off.

I like it somehow but not so much as impressed as when I read the original Manga. Probably because I knew the main plot already.The ending seems to open the possibility to Season 2 with the Protagonist of the Japanese version shows up to join the Grey team. Maybe there will be more interesting plots in Season 2 hopefully.Spoiler alert....
BTW, I think it's plot hole what the Grey leader lady always use her cut-off ear. She showed that her ear was gone by her infected husband.To me it makes no sense why half transformed head with one blade of Su-in can win all the full transformed head with 2 blades. This was explained by the infected woman, the sister of Kan-woo. Still it make no sense for me though. The speed of all the infected guys look the same for me.

The VFX work is really excellent and it is good to see Korean shows coming with much better stories and beautiful background music.

I just finished the last episode and if I could, I'd rate 11/10. Don't want to give any spoilers but it just made the show THAT much better. There was also a part where Heidi tried to get in the car quickly to get away and the actress nailed it!! I even laughed because it was subtle but so good.

In the newly series it fight so well right away at the get go, as the script writer don't bother to any character development.Storyline is so poorly scripted. At one point the main male broke into the so dangerous parasyte warehouse for no reason. The next he performs some heroic rescue to the main girl. And then suddenly he wants to quit, before his best friend got killed. And that killer parasyte suddenly becomes so intellectual and start being friend of human, just because she got betrayed. The acting of the grey team boss is so inconsistent too, when she first appears acting crazy but when the story goes on she becomes normal as hell.No to mention the main setting of parasyte in the hand is 100 times better than parasyte in the head.Overall I don't get why any fan of the original would accept this.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

With that said, I think this series was good overall. I would put its rating at just below 6.5 so I'll round down to 6.Doing a live action remake of Parasyte must be especially difficult since deformation of the animated aliens is more believable....as crazy as that sounds.

Although season 1 was literally 6 episodes I'd say they could and should have expanded on a few elements more seeing as how they have a whole manga to base from.Enjoyable and entertaining but too short to be memorable or really fulfilling. The action was good and understandable with a good flow, there is no dawdling on insignificant matters. The ending is a surprise and you might need to read into who is introduced and what significance they have to the universe.Needs to have more story and something of actual importance or value happen in season 2 to not ruin it.

That is like people knowing each other and running into each other 11 times in Phoenix, San Antonio or Philadelphia, without the use of GPS and totally by accident.No security anywhere...none. People are walking right up to police sergeant's desks and rummaging through them with no one noticing.The main characters, police, bad guys & bystanders all make the most insane non-rational decision almost 80% of the time. You are chasing a villain that has killed multiple policemen with guns....and one episode later you say..'Let's split up'.In another fight, let's go in without any weapons at all, after seeing a bunch of your colleagues die when they had weapons.

This keeps the number of infected humans down, and we see no mass extinction.The story picks up when a supermarket clerk is nearly murdered by a psychopath, right before being possessed herself. Due to her injuries, the parasite was unable to fully take over her body, and they live a symbiotic relationship.It's unfortunate that with all this potential, it fails to execute on multiple levels.

The ending strongly suggests that there will be a second season, especially considering the show's strong viewership numbers. It's still trending in the top 10 in my country, so I have high hopes that it will continue, and let's hope season 2 will be as good as or even better than season 1. If you haven't watched 'The Maxim' yet, you'll likely enjoy this show. Give it a try.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,What a total waste!This short series HAD potential but was utterly trashed by horrendous writing.Flow of events ridiculously nonsensical. Inconsistencies are glaringly everywhere. The whole thing is just an idiotic mess.Characters both human and parasytes make obvious illogical moves or non-moves over and over just to drag out more nonsense. Dialogue is poorly constructed and silly.The main nonsense apart from so many others is there is no solid reason (except for a weak stupid excuse that has no basis whatsoever) why the half-parasyte need or want to aid humans other than the director wanting to force in without any rhyme or reason a 'sympathetic' character - which is just laughable.The narrative keep pushing the fact that the parasytes ultimate aim is to survive. And they could all survive half-human or not. Why the meaningless conflict with that half-human???The two Japanese movies some years ago were much much superior to this junk plotting.,negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"I'm not a big fan of anime, but I watched the original Parasyte Anime a long time ago and loved it.I really wished I had more of it, it was great in almost every direction.So when I saw there was a live action spin-off I was skeptical at first, but as I watched it it was a dream come true, have a great first episode that was filled to the brim with content and fun visuals.The effects and CGI were amazing, only a single time did I think it looked weird but it was only on for a split when slow transitioning.It's probably not a 10/10 but I loved it so much and was so happy so to me it is.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

I really liked the way the drama unfolded the whole story with well placed flashbacks throughout, I don't usually like this but i did here. The acting was excellent all the characters were brought to life very well especially loved the actress who played the mutant, she did a wonderful job of portraying both sides of the character human and parasyte.

I see it as the perfect mix of what makes the original anime amazing, as well as a fresh perspective on the story. OG fans will honestly love this. I'm sure of it, being one myself. I'm hard to please with live-action remakes so imagine my surprise , This is how a live-action adaptation of an anime/manga should be done. Instead of retelling the same story, ""Parasyte the Grey"" expand on the worldbuilding of the original source material.

tt21874396,"You know when this started I had lots of doubts and worries because Live action Anime Adaptations usually suck and they usually are terribly produced, But watching 2 Episodes in so far.. or well 1 n half actually lol and I thought this is such an insane Anime adapted series is so Good!! So when I found this series I thought aww damnit its in Korean.. n produced by koreans.. nothing against them and all but its a Japanese anime so you kinda wonder how could they do it justice really???????? I dont think I have ever seen a film or show that adapted it from another country and did it this impressively and quite frankly I dont think the Japanese could have done it as good as these Koreans have. Korean films n drama have been renowned in the last 10 years with Kpop also becoming a huge worldwide thing, Korean cinema has been impressively improving many folds every year that its become probably ranked top 3 worldwide in quality & fandom after American Hollywood & than United Kingdom British stuff, so I would have not doubted the Koreans ability at all if it wasnt for the series being about an anime.So anyway the graphics are amazing!! Its so crisp and clear & it can honestly match Hollywood in how realistic it looks when the aliens show themselves and fight. Japanese Live anime adaptations usually are a hit or miss in where they either have good acting n bad graphics quality or vice versa, But this Korean one has great acting and great quality CGI/VFX. I Read some online reviews knocking their graphics on looking fake or bad and I thought these websites are out kf their minds!? Its like have they even seen much Live Anime adaptations? For these ppl to act as if this is some C grade Hollywod movies... its ridiculous!! Sure its not quality like Transformers films or James Cameron Avatar film or Star Wars films but why would anyone even compare it to them? Those are all insane high budget films and this Parasyte Grey is a Tv series.Some other complaints I read from people were about the pacing being to slow, they expected much more monster battles per episode without even understanding the simple fact its a Tv series ppl! They can't give you movie quality lengthy battles lol. I just think ppl tend to forget this is not a hollywood series so maybe these ppl are unfamiliar with how asian series tend to be or specifically Korean ones possibly? I think some people were also dissapointedthat the main anime character is not the lead character in this series and thats okay really cause in the Anime and now this live action series they tell you that the aliens appeared all over the world so whatever happens in the Anime is somewhere else, while this series plot is in Korea, their is no contradiction at all and you could consider it as an expansion side story to the anime if u like cuz I know many ppl for sure have at one point wondered ""How everyone else is doing in the world vs this threat?"" and now we got our answer! Maybe next time they do an American one lol. If I was to add a complaint it would be the main character, I feel like she is written to be.. to quiet?? To timid?? I just feel most ppl in her position would be more frantic in personality or lively I guess? The male lead is good though, as well the head female unit leader she adds some nice flavours to the series with her... I guess.. wild side sometimes? Or maybe wrong choice of words.. shes like kooky sometimes mid sentence as if shes got The Joker inside of her waiting to burst out at anytime in the middle of speaking a sentence lol or maybe Ingot her all wrong ? Anyway the old male cop its too early to pass judgement yet but he seems okay.Now to continue watching and return to report back n edit my review if any changes are needed, Enjoy the series everyone ^_^",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

Some of the worst i have ever heard. Emotionless, monotone. You name it. Its there.Maybe it gets better, but If i knew nothing about the original show I would be at a total loss.

The character leads are all strong but each have their flaws, which to me always makes the characters more believable. There is a lot of gore, horror and bloodshed's but it fits well in this mirror.

it felt a bit cheap and kind of stupid, but when you watch the further episodes, it makes sense for the further story line.This korean version is playing in the same universe like the japanese one without mixing the characters.I m praying they are making at least 4-6 season for this.Give this show a try and be open minded for a new story line.I dont understand the bad reviews of the hardcore fans, just because its not a remake of the japanes version.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Hello Fellow Humans,Great show and well worth watching. I loved the Anime and thus was a great extension of it. At the very end their is an amazing twist I will not give away. But the anime and this show merge together somehow. So clearly they will be making more which is great because this is an amazing series. However like all police or military dramas it has flaws. I mean it's cool to show you shots and it makes things more intense. But for example the music festival when she shot randomly at the cars that would not happen. Police especially task force police are trained extremely well and would never shoot randomly. Plus the city or county would be liable for any damages and injuries. Bringing me to my next point if this was to actually happen the military would have taken over instantly. Actually if this really happened The USA would have taken over 100% and many world militaries are interchangeable with the US military. Well or they are able to be used and taken over. So if this happened you would have the US military involved and I wish they included this as it was a global event. Thus a global task force would be working to take this parasite out. But besides my personal annoyances with those issues it is a great show and I truly hope they make more.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

Each episode shows insane animation and praying mantis reflex speeds of action and combat. The sheer danger these parasites pose to humankind is made plain and clear.Jeon So-nee plays the emotionally weakened and vulnerable protagonist; one cannot help but feel overwhelmed with mercy for her sorry plight from childhood into the series itself. The tragedies depicted in this series about the true human cost are quite moving. There is plenty of character growth as well, and there are debates around individuality versus collective objectives of existence.The series leaves you guessing about identity, with twists and turns at every junction.

There are a lot of potential in those ones, and they can be very scary and suspenseful, if it's well written/directed. But this show is not.Choi Jun-kyung (the leader of the parasite hunters) is totally overacting her role. All her scenes seem like a ridiculous parody of a real horror movie.The people that are infected (ruled by) parasites act like very slow minded persons with serious mental issues. The way these actors present the infected people are simply not believable.The story is not suspenseful at all, it feels like it's rushed and that makes it chaotic, also making the show hard to follow and understand.

tt21874396,"As a huge fan of the original series, this netflix adaptation didn't disappoint at all. The acting, direction and CGI were on point. Every episode got me hooked that I finished this series in one day.So, why did I gave this series a 9/10? As much as I love this storyline, it's always corny how some lead characters tend to make stupid decisions. Just like how one of the male leads decided to explore the parasyte's headquarters alone and nearly died. Furthermore, the woman leading The Grey team is way too hard headed that she became an unpleasant character with her own stance. Sure, you wanna defend humans more. But, with all these evidence why don't you trust Su-in for once? I feel the director wanted to stretch this persona until the very end of the story.The open ending scene to this series made me smile so hard. Firstly, the moment the male turned I was shocked to see my favorite Japanese actor, Suda. Then, my jaw dropped when he mentioned Shinichi Izumi. The last part where they zoomed into his right hand was top-notch. It was so good that I had to replay that scene a hundred times. This 10 seconds scene stole the whole show and a treat to the original anime fans.In conclusion, this series is worth the watch as it only contains 6 episodes.

tt21874396,"Parasyte: The Grey is a captivating South Korean adaptation of the highly acclaimed manga and anime series ""Parasyte"" (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu) by Hitoshi Iwaaki. This Netflix series takes the core essence of the original story-a world where alien parasites invade human bodies, causing a crisis of identity and survival-and transposes it into a new cultural and narrative context. This review delves into various aspects of the series, including its plot, characters, themes, visual aesthetics, and overall execution.Plot and PacingThe plot of Parasyte: The Grey follows the unsettling invasion of Earth by mysterious alien parasites. These entities burrow into human brains, taking control of their hosts' bodies, often resulting in horrific transformations. The central character, Jeon Sang-woo, a high school student, becomes partially infected by a parasite that fails to fully assimilate him. This creates a unique symbiosis where Jeon retains his consciousness and personality while gaining some of the parasite's abilities.The series is well-paced, balancing moments of intense action with slower, more reflective scenes that explore the psychological and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters. Unlike many action-heavy series, ""Parasyte: The Grey"" invests time in building its world and developing its characters, ensuring that viewers are not only entertained but also engaged on an intellectual level.*Characters and PerformancesJeon Sang-woo is a compelling protagonist, portrayed with depth and nuance. His internal struggle-navigating his new identity while retaining his humanity-is depicted with a relatable mix of fear, confusion, and resilience. The parasite within him, Migi, is a fascinating character in its own right. The dynamic between Jeon and Migi, blending tension and reluctant cooperation, is one of the series' highlights.Supporting characters, including Jeon's friends and family, as well as other parasitic hosts, add layers to the narrative. Each character brings their own perspectives and motivations, enriching the story. The performances are uniformly strong, with the actors successfully conveying the horror and existential dread that underpin the series.Themes and Philosophical UnderpinningsParasyte: The Grey delves into several profound themes, including identity, humanity, and the nature of existence. The parasites serve as a metaphor for various forms of intrusion and transformation, prompting viewers to question what it means to be human. The series also explores themes of survival and adaptation, both on an individual and species level.The ethical dilemmas faced by the characters-such as the morality of killing parasitic hosts who retain some semblance of their original selves-are thought-provoking. These themes are handled with a deft touch, never feeling heavy-handed or preachy. Instead, they naturally emerge from the narrative, encouraging viewers to engage with the material on a deeper level.Visual Aesthetics and EffectsVisually, Parasyte: The Grey is striking. The series effectively uses practical effects and CGI to bring the grotesque transformations of the parasites to life. The design of the parasites is faithful to the original manga, maintaining their unsettling and otherworldly appearance. The action sequences are well-choreographed, blending tension and horror with visceral impact.The cinematography is another strong point, utilizing a muted color palette to reflect the series' dark tone. The use of light and shadow enhances the sense of dread, creating a visually cohesive and immersive experience. The settings, from urban landscapes to more intimate, personal spaces, are meticulously crafted to support the narrative's mood.Sound and MusicThe sound design and music of Parasyte: The Grey play crucial roles in building the series' atmosphere. The soundtrack, composed of eerie and atmospheric pieces, heightens the tension and underscores the emotional beats of the story. Sound effects, particularly those associated with the parasites, are disturbingly effective, adding to the horror elements.Cultural AdaptationOne of the intriguing aspects of Parasyte: The Grey is how it adapts the original Japanese story to a South Korean context. The series retains the core themes and narrative structure of ""Parasyte"" while infusing it with cultural nuances that resonate with Korean viewers. This adaptation respects the source material while offering something new, making it accessible to a broader audience.Parasyte: The Grey is a standout adaptation that successfully blends horror, action, and philosophical inquiry. It stays true to the spirit of the original manga while carving out its own identity. The series excels in character development, thematic depth, and visual storytelling, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre. Whether you are familiar with the original ""Parasyte"" or new to the story, Parasyte: The Grey offers a gripping and thought-provoking experience that lingers long after the final episode.This series not only reaffirms the enduring appeal of Hitoshi Iwaaki's creation but also showcases the potential for cross-cultural adaptations to breathe new life into beloved stories.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Surprisingly good Korean, live action adaption of Japanese manga and anime Parasyte. Also proof that an adaptation can take an original story approach and still remain true to the original source material. But perhaps most surprising, and my favorite part of P:TG is the characters. By and large, all characters are likable, interesting. Importantly, these characters are ones the viewer wants to grow, develop and succeed.Who would like this? I'd say fans of TV shows like the Strain, Helix - movies like the Resident Evil franchise and all the adaptations of Body Snatchers. It's been a while since a good version of the Body Snatchers. Parasyte: the Grey takes itself Very seriously, and helps if the viewer can suspend disbelief and immerse themselves into the experience.Essentially this show follows two main characters Su-In and Kang-Woo. Both are basically ordinary people living in South Korea. The story belongs to female lead Su-In who works as a grocery clerk, but is revealed that her life has been one with traumatic misfortune going back to childhood. Kang-Woo is a low level gangster who finds himself a pawn of his own organization. Their lives are both upended by the introduction of a radical environmental element - parasite eggs falling from the sky that seek out a human host to possess. More characters are introduced including law enforcement and possessed humans, the parasite enemies.Most the character development involves the two main characters who both change radically from the first episode to the last. Su-In is literally changed into a new entity, and Kang-Woo has to face inner demons for abandoning family to become a criminal. To stress my favorite part of P:TG, following the characters journeys is entertaining and satisfying.I really enjoyed the performances, especially of the lead Su-In. She plays two characters who are quite different, which speaks to good pre-production work and direction on set. Anyone who has watch AAA South Korean TV shows will have an idea of what to expect in terms of production quality.Like the best genre work, P:TG asks interesting questions about the human condition. A big reason for this is the reflected humanity in possessed humans. Their clumsy and robotic social interactions are a great counterpoint for how we go about our daily lives. The parasite entities are individually very powerful, but can be defeated via human team work via our social structures/institutions.There's also an ax grinding ecological quality to the show revealed in the first episodes introduction, but luckily that thread is not stressed or focused upon. It feels more like foreshadowing for future content if this TV show has a few seasons and is allowed to mature.Effects are very good. Action scenes are horrific and an excellent part of the show. There is a lot of content that could descend into stark pessimism/nihilism, but it never does! Heroism and optimism are two stressed qualities throughout the arc. A lot of this stems from honoring those lost, which is a profound message.Truly, an excellent first season. While the first season arc is complete, the last episode does end on a minor cliff hanger which will likely serve as the takeoff point for the 2nd season. Recommended for fans of horror genre, and maybe for someone who wants to go outside of their general comfort zone.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Like most people, I associate South Korean media with dark and depressing tales about the depravity of mankind and the inherent cruelty of the human condition (as you can probably tell, I don't watch a lot of K dramas).So, colour me surprised that Parasyte: The Grey is not only as action packed and gory as a show (apparently based on a manga, which tracks) about head replacing alien parasites who can transform into all manner of bladed weapons would be, but it also has a lot...heart.First off, the show has some truly excellent action scenes. I don't know why, but East Asian media seems to capture what live action ""anime"" should look like in a way American and Western media more generally just can't. The action is fluid, fast, and a bit incredulous, but doesn't cross into the uncanny valley quite as much as you'd think.Parasyte in many ways reminds me of how action films USED to be; without all of the moral, self-deprecating baggage we expect from contemporary media.I liked that the government agency tasked with hunting the parasites is competent and rational, and the people involved generally make good decisions. Choi Jun-Kyung (played by Lee Jung-hyun) is a fantastic, classic action movie protagonist; she's not only capable and confident, but willing to entertain other ideas and perspectives. In a sense, the show reminds us WHY good leadership matters, with leadership being a running theme throughout the series.Jeon Su-in (Jeon So-nee) and Seol Kang-Woo (Koo Kyo-Hwan) are the emotional heart of the show; Su-in's character gives the show opportunities to ruminate on what it means to be human and the give us greater insights into the parasites, their survival strategy, and perspective on life. It's nice to see a show for once acknowledge that hey, humans have done a lot of impressive things with nothing more than our brains and capacity to organize. It's worth admiring.I also liked that the parasites weren't these uber competent beings tha the humans had no hope in defeating. I mean, realistically, they're organisms that cannot exist without hosts and have very rudimentary goals and needs. They don't have culture or art or techology; they are, for lack of a better term, DUMBER than people are. That they act somewhat like animals and show a complete lack of understanding of humanity, learning about us on the go, not only makes sense but is again, REFRESHING.I don't know how much of this is from the manga, but it makes me want to go back and read it.The show isn't entirely perfect; the CG can look a bit wonky and there is a price to pay with the earnest simplicity the show offers. I think certain things wrap up a bit too conveniently and the show doesn't really offer much in the way of a compelling hook for what comes next. But overall, if you like sci-fi action and aren't put off by body horror, I highly recommend this one.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"""Parasitic War"" is a must-watch series for any fan of science fiction and high-stakes drama.

The show deftly combines intense action with emotional depth, creating a captivating experience from start to finish.The CGI in this series is outstanding. The parasitic creatures are both terrifying and fascinating, with intricate designs and realistic movements that make them feel almost tangible.

The actors deliver exceptional performances, bringing authenticity and complexity to their characters. The series centers on a diverse group of survivors, each with their own background and motivation. The lead actor is particularly compelling, playing a reluctant hero who evolves into a determined leader. The supporting cast is equally strong, with standout performances from the scientist who discovers the parasites' weaknesses and the hardened soldier who becomes a mentor to the younger members of the group.What makes ""Parasitic War"" so engaging is its ability to weave character development into a high-octane storyline. The series doesn't shy away from exploring the emotional and psychological toll of the conflict, showing how these characters cope with fear, loss, and the constant threat of invasion. The relationships that form among the group feel authentic, and you can't help but root for them as they face increasingly dire circumstances.Overall, ""Parasitic War"" is a thrilling and visually stunning series that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next episode.

tt21874396,"Parasyte : The Grey is sadly not memorable nor is it remarkable . It is a shame that the producer and director failed to fulfil the potential of this series . It was like a series from the 70s but without the charm . There was no atmosphere . There was no suspense or frights or surprises . No twists or turns . It was bland . The monsters were also very boring .A parasitic monster enters a human . It eats the human's brain. Then it cuts cut off the human's head . It grows a new head and takes over the human's body and pretends to be that person . Sometimes the monsters kill humans for food , as that's all they can eat . It is very 'matter of factly' portrayed . So as they were going down that road , they should have used the analogy that humans kill animals for food too . It would have been somewhat logical and fit into their general concept.( NB . They did tried to make it gruesome by showing human body parts and deceased humans in plastic coverings but it lacked substance contradicted their entire theme)There is a government secret organisation who deal with the monsters . The organisation is called The Grey . They are independent of the police .After incidents regarding the monsters rise , the active head of The Grey , Choi Jung ,holds a conference whereby she tells the police about the existence of monsters and recruits their help.The actress who plays Choi Jung ,over plays her role. We see the past . She was meek before her husband became a monster but now she's strong and stubborn to the point that she'd stupid and defies logic and so places her team at risk .There are terrible and obvious failings in The Parasyte . Grey which include :
.1) The monsters secretly take over the human's body and pretend to be that human . However they do not know how to imitate any form of human emotions and characteristics.and expressions . They don't smile , frown , get annoyed, laugh etc . They are robotic like. They speak in a monotone voice of a robot ( like in films made in the 70s) . YET NO-ONE NOTICES THAT ! They all believe it's the real person ! Lol!2) Choi Jung is THE expert regarding monsters .When the main detective who she always talks to becomes a monster she doesn't notice either ! He talks in a monotone robotic voice, has no expressions and yet she doesn't notice!It's ridiculous ! Her character is incredibly stupid! . (The actress is terrible in role too . Awful actress!)3);There is a major incident with monsters killing humans . The policeman Cheol Ming wants to follow his friend Jeong Su-In who is in a truck ,as she is in danger . He knows his fellow colleague is working for the monsters yet he lets him get in his car and even lets him drive . Then Cheol Ming is surprised when his colleague takes him to another destination off track . His colleague asks him to join him by working for the monsters as the money is good .Instead of pretending that he will so that he can get out of a dangerous situation he shouts at his colleague and says he'd never do that . Cheong Min knows that his pistol will not kill a monster but when the Pastor who is the leader of the monsters shows up he shoots him. The body that the Pastor is using is destroyed but the monster isn't . So the monster cuts off Cheol Min's head and gets into his body and grows a new head. So the monster becomes Cheong Min4) One of the prominent female monsters is very vicious and hunts and kills humans. Suddenly without any logical explanation she starts helping humans .She mumbles some nonsensical garbage which I presume is meant to be her reason . These parasitic Monsters are not capable of having any kind of emotion. They merely exist . So why would she start helping humans!5) The physical apprarance of the monsters is not original . It's been done many times before.The monster gets these long tentacles like that of an octopus, growing out of its head , which it uses to attack people . The way it moves when attacking people is laughable . The movement is like when a woman who has long hair, moves her head fast from side to side. Her hair would have a momentum and say there was a light ornament as she was doing that, she'd knock the ornament of its pedestal with her hair . It's the same kind of movement the monster uses . Actually they could have used that movement to their advantage by having rock music in the background .That would have been cool and amusing .The positives of this series :

tt21874396,"They've done a great job adapting the story to live action without stepping on the toes of the Anime.Rather than take a stab at adapting the anime 1:1 (which always ends up falling short), they take the smart approach of dealing with the Parasites that fell in other areas (Korea) and run with the story there. By doing so, they dont run the risk of upsetting folks by not matching everything, while also simultaneously expanding the universe they've built.I will say, though, that the show writers seem to have expected you to have watched the Anime -- which is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing in that they are able to gloss over a lot of the ""cumbersome"" dialog from the Anime assuming you know some of the details (which also helps when things happen and you ""get it"" without overbearing exposition). The curse being that it adds a slight barrier of entry to the show, as a first time watcher with no exposure to the Anime may have questions that go ""unanswered"".That being said, if you liked the anime you will like this show.

It explores the laws of life on the earth, whether it is humans or parasitic beasts, how the two species survive has nothing to do with the earth, it is the law between the organisms themselves, you can survive the fittest, you can coexist peacefully, or maintain some kind of balance under the unwarranted dividing line.But for the Earth, it has remained the same for millions of years, and it has not changed a single bit.This is the ultimate proposition of Shinichi's thinking at the end of the comic, in addition to reverence for life itself, but also for the creator of nature, the earth.",neutral,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

I have been IN LOVE with Korean cinema and tv since I first saw the movie ""Friend"" more than 20 years ago.As you may have guessed, I'm also a huge fan of anime. Now, the original ""Parasyte"" anime was not bad. It was a fun animated series. It didn't hold a candle to this. The characters are well though - out. The plot has enough twists to keep even someone like me guessing as to what's going to happen next (which I love). You don't even know when someone is going to be killed off (or how suddenly). And the production values -- come on, they're Korean production values. The production values are SO over the top. Why do you think this has ten solid stars?The entire cast is excellent. The acting is very natural. Jeon So-nee plays the shy, introverted, humble, brave and beautiful and vulnerable orphan, Su-in. This is the first time that I've seen Jeon So-nee in a production but she's won me over so far in the four episodes that I've watched with my son. I'm familiar with the actor playing the secondary protagonist, Koo Kyo-hwan. I've seen him in ""Peninsula,"" ""Kingdom: Ashin of the North"" and ""Kill Boksoon."" He's great.

To make it more understandable, they even made the sheriffe as a used-to-be helpless housewife who lost loved ones due to the monster. Mind games are mostly carried out by the mosnters which made human-being just like purely preys, both physcially and mentally. Unlike the original anime where human-being are smarter than the mosnters only physically weaker to them. These monsters are supposed to be strong animals and weak on minds.

Those long-term fans of the Parasyte franchise will also appreciate the similarities between Jeong Su-In and Shinichi Izumi in their symbiotic relationship with their parasites. There's also a great character arc for gangster turned fighter Seol Kang-Woo that needs to be seen.True to Korean horror, the visuals here are on a whole other level. Tight-knit fight choreography, frantic and violent carnage, and an adherence to polished flair throughout combo for some fantastic scenes. The CGI is especially great too, as is the cinematography. There's a mix of action aesthetic to the sci-fi horror and it works quite brilliantly in the overall look..... The acting, especially by the cast that have to perform as either parasite or human, is especially skillful. They transform into their roles. You can see how seriously everyone takes their roles and there are no bad performances here..... The soundtrack is also quite suspenseful, with a few bits that lean especially heavily towards more tense fare. There's also especially strong detail in the sound effects, especially with the way the parasites sound when they're fighting.Whether you're a fan of the Parasyte series or you're a newcomer, you'll definitely enjoy Parasyte: The Grey.",positive,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

The Puppet Masters film (1994) is less well known though. Parasitical alien creatures rain down on South Korea (and presumably elsewhere) taking over human hosts by wriggling in through ears.

The concept is good. Although the first episode is long, it didn't feel too slow or boring.The lead character, the actress, is likable and makes you want to root for her survival.Negatives:
The episodes are 45 minutes or longer, with the first episode lasting 1 hour.Other than the lead character, there wasn't any character that I liked that much.I thought it would be as cool and amazing as ""All of Us Are Dead,"" but it's not that engaging.The way they were talking about the parasite in the ending meeting of the first episode, the man who became a parasite at the start, and no one except the lead character reacted before it starts attacking, the parasite writing in the diary ( I mean really?), these things looked like a joke or lazy writing.After almost every few minutes, a new lead or side character is introduced, which could confuse the viewer.There are not even a few characters to root for, no romantic tension, no good action scenes, and the first episode didn't even end with a cliffhanger or something.Overall, the first episode was average but for someone who hasn't watched many shows may even like this episode, to me, it was 2.25/5. Just because there are only 6 episodes and the lead character is likeable, I might complete it someday.

tt21874396,"When I saw that a Korean version of Parasyte was about to be released, I was both excited (because I really liked the story and concept of the manga) and afraid of the final result, as it is a short episodes Netflix production, and Netflix Korea messed up the previous series I was really looking forward to (Sweet Home part 2).Honestly, if you don't know much about the original story (either from the manga or the 2 parts movie) and don't really expect much in terms of quality work, this will be just fine for you.But as for me, I started watching Korean series because they were so good at taking their time to set up characters, background stories and atmospheres, and not aiming for a second season (meaning, just making a single season series and taking their time to tell a story from the beginning till the end). The original Parasyte was great, because it was questioning our place as humans, and what makes people humans (plus maternity, friendship and other stuff).This one... is just a typical Netflix series: some fun moments and visuals, some entertainement, but you just forget about it a month later.As for the series quality, the CGI aren't that good, they look somewhat cheap (this reminded me of Connect, another cheap Disney+ Korean series), the characters and story aren't that compelling, and the short format (6 episodes) isn't fit for korean series. Well, maybe they'll do just the same as they did with Sweet home, releasing a second season many years after, with a huge time lapse and characters change right in the middle of the season...Before thinking that this is a piece of art, just read the manga and watch the movies. You'll then realise that this is just a cheap rip-off.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

tt21874396,"""The Parasite Grey"" TV series, despite its intriguing premise, suffers from a lack of originality and a meandering plotline, leading many viewers to label it as a derivative work that bears striking similarities to the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. The series attempts to explore a post-apocalyptic world overrun by parasitic organisms that transform humans into grotesque and violent creatures. However, the story arc follows a formulaic path, recycling familiar tropes without injecting fresh ideas or character development. The show heavily relies on action sequences and special effects to maintain viewer interest, yet it ultimately falls flat due to its uninspired narrative and predictable twists.One of the redeeming qualities of ""The Parasite Grey"" is its cast, who deliver commendable performances despite the lackluster script. The actors bring depth to their roles, portraying a range of emotions that hint at the personal struggles and relationships within this bleak world. Their efforts to breathe life into the otherwise one-dimensional characters are commendable, but even strong acting can't salvage a plot that seems to be on autopilot. The interactions between characters are occasionally compelling, suggesting that with better writing, the show could have been more engaging and nuanced.The show's CGI and special effects are visually impressive, contributing to the sense of chaos and horror in this dystopian landscape. The scenes involving the parasitic creatures are rendered with meticulous detail, creating a convincing atmosphere of tension and danger. The production team clearly invested in high-quality visual effects, and this aspect of the series generally receives positive feedback from viewers. Unfortunately, the glossy appearance of the CGI cannot make up for the series' lack of substance, and it's not enough to elevate the overall viewing experience.Despite these technical achievements, ""The Parasite Grey"" suffers from a dull story that lacks the suspense and complexity necessary to keep audiences engaged. The plot tends to follow a predictable trajectory, with little innovation in terms of character arcs or narrative structure. The show often feels like it's going through the motions, with repetitive scenarios and an overreliance on action sequences to drive the story forward. There are few, if any, meaningful surprises or revelations, leaving viewers with a sense of monotony rather than anticipation for what's next.Overall, ""The Parasite Grey"" presents a mixed bag of quality acting and impressive CGI overshadowed by a dull and uninspired story. While the series may appeal to those who enjoy post-apocalyptic themes and high-octane action, its lack of originality and engagement may turn off viewers seeking a more compelling narrative. The show often feels like a missed opportunity, failing to capitalize on the potential for character development and deeper storytelling within its setting. The result is a series that, despite its strong production values, ultimately comes across as a boring and uninspired rehash of familiar ideas.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"
tt21874396,"Not long ago, I rewatched the anime and even now, it remain as true gem. Parasyte the Grey (Gisaengsu: Deo geurei) does not pay tribute to the series, only tries do to better and fails imensevely, that was my first introduction to the ""dorama"" catagory and I was surprised it is so shalow; the dialogs seem to have been made by I. A. and do not represent the original source, and the CGI is just bad, it's like and reimaged of Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu in other universe not in the same timeline. They placed Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu lore in Parasyste the Grey, but charactazation it's not there, Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu it's not good because the history is about parasytes in human bodies, but the deep characters that are in the show that makes the anime so good even nowdays. The biggest flaw in Parasyte the Grey has to be the parasyte telling who it is to a random stranger for no good reason. I mean if you are a parasyste and need to hide yourself, you don't tell anyone; you can tell to your host because that host will know eventually, but telling who you are to a random stranger can put you at risk and make your survival at risk, that was the whole point in the anime made by Mig in Kiseijû: Sei no Kakuritsu why any parasyste reveal themselves to anyone other their kin, if they do to a human, why let the human live? If that information can put your wellbeing at risk, you as a parasite have to kill anyone who knows you are a parasite.",negative,"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"

tt6611916,"I've been waiting for this series to come out since the start of january, and I've got to say it has paid off. I think it was George A. Romero, who once said that Horror was a way for him to make a social statement and guess this series somehow delivers that in a great way (in one episode there's a strange- and quite actual- discussion on what to do with the bodies of working and high society people). There's also the long and neverending question between slow and fast zombies. After Train to Busan we got a peek to what South Korea seems to prefer, and I'm glad with this, but if you add the fact that these zombies share also some similarities with vampires (the fact that they're scared/damaged by light) it just climb up to other levels of awesomeness. I would like to say that what most attracted me to this series is the fact that the zombie Genre had long been quite unexploited and Kingdom is a rare gem because not only it's an era drama/horror series but also all the things I've stated before.

tt6611916,"As my title suggested I am amazed at the successful combination of different genres so to speak. It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.Moreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the ""subtle"" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!In terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning!

The shows pacing is perfect. The acting is impeccable and all the actors and actresses did incredible. The action was absolutely epic af. No exaggeration. Blood and Gore galore. The battles are the Koreans version of GOT. Korean anything in cinema is my absolute favorite. I feel like they reinvent the wheel constantly for outdoing their previous entries all the time and that ""us"" as American Filmmakers can learn a thing or two from them. The money they invested into this show definitely shows with each episode costing a tad more than 1.78 million dollars. The cinematography is to die for literally lol. The shots in both the action scenes and dramatic yet everyday scenes that were filmed are superb. The tension of the shots is evident at every angle. If you never liked reading subtitles prior you need to fix that crap immediately because this show is so worth it. I hope and pray that they make a season two because as it stands this is my favorite show of 2019 and it's only January and this will undoubtedly remain my new favorite show.

tt6611916,"I was recommended to watch ""Kingdom"" by a friend, as he knew I love everything zombiesque, and somehow the South Korean horror drama ""Kingdom"" had managed to elude my radar.With ""Kingdom"" readily available on Netflix, I sat down and watched all 6 episodes of the first season in rapid succession. While ""Kingdom"" is no ""The Walking Dead"" in a South Korean interpretation, it is still a rather enjoyable TV series because of equal parts zombie action and storytelling.""Kingdom"" is somewhat hindered by a rather slow pacing, that while it definitely helps the movie and story, it just made me feel that it took the series forever to get up in gear and to become good. But the slow pace was necessary, I suppose, because it helped establish the character gallery quite well, while offering bits and pieces of adrenaline-filled segments to the audience of things to come.While ""Kingdom"" is not following the average (and generic) zombie formula, it is still a very enjoyable show and it is an interesting approach on a zombie outbreak. One thing that I am usually not enjoying is agile, fast and running zombies, but it actually works quite well in ""Kingdom"" for some reason.This is a TV series where zombies are a part, yes, but it is not a TV series about the zombies. No, this is a drama about well-defined and nicely portrayed characters and their quests for survival, hunger for power, revenge, political plays and such.The TV series have a very nice ensemble of casted actors and actresses to portray to the various roles and characters in the show. I was definitely more than pleasantly surprised to see Doona Bae (playing Seo-bi) in the show, and she brings with her a lot of grace.The zombie make-up is adequate, and it serves its purpose quite well. As stated above, this is not a TV series about the zombies themselves, so it is not richly endowed with gross and ghastly special effects displaying gore and other such grim things that are often a major part in the zombie movies and TV series. Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, naturally as a massive zombie fanatic I would like to see as much blood, guts and mayhem as possible, but the toned down brutality and gore of ""Kingdom"" actually suits the theme and atmosphere of the TV series quite well.The downside to ""Kingdom"" is the slow pacing of the story. While it was a mere 6 episodes running just short of an hour or so each, it felt much, much longer. But it is hardly a deterrence for me to shy away from season 2 if it should make its way to Netflix.""Kingdom"" is definitely well worth watching if you are a fan of the zombie genre, and need something to fill the time in between other zombie shows.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

At first I thought the idea of mixing period drama with zombie is laughable but with here, it works. Overall great and I couldn't wait for the next season!",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"I rarely write reviews, especially for series. The Kingdom definitely deserves one.I've never been a fan of zombie movies/series, I find them very bland and uninteresting. So I was very skeptic about these series too. I was so wrong!I couldn't stop watching it from the beginning. The actors did an amazing job, I fell in love with the costumes and the cinematography. It kept me on my toes until the very end!If you haven't watched it, do it, you won't regret!Can't wait for season 3, hopefully we will see it soon.",unknown,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"The acting is great, the cinematography is incredible, the production value is outstanding, and yet we are left with a plot that is pretty simple and predictable for the most part. I enjoyed this, don't get me wrong, but I was really expecting there to be higher stakes and significantly more tensions throughout. For a horror series, it was only until the final episode that I ever even got a good jump scare. I respect the use of actual extras to perform as the zombies, but holy crap--some of these extras are so silly in their body language/performance/movement that there is no hiding their human-ness regardless of how much makeup you put on them. Characters are very simply defined without much moral ambiguity, increasing the simplicity of the story.Will watch season 2, but this series is not yet ground-breaking beyond it's production value.",negative,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"This show is so worth watching, a zombie story with depth!That is something you never get, it has an interesting storyline running all the way through, not about zombies.They are more like a secondary storyline.The zombies are not like you see in most other shows, they are there and they attack but the focus is not on the blood and gore, they are wild people, not slow walking bones.The story is about people doing anything to gain ultimate power.The zombies are referred to as monsters, but truly it is the humans that are far worse.So far the show has been very surprising, there are tender moments,
great displays of loyalty and revenge, along with espionage and evil doings.The fight scenes are plausable, not the typical Chinese martial arts over the top stuff, no one flying through the sky or running up walls.It is really one of the best zombie based shows I have ever seen, the movie is good too. I hate subtitled material, but I don't mind this at all, it is well worth it. Even if you are fed up of zombie stuff, watch it, as I said it isn't the main focus.So watch it, enjoy some good writing, acting, scenery and special effects.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"This series is terrible. The plot is poor, the acting is awful with terrible 'over-acting' and ridiculous facial expressions. On top of that, it is very poorly dubbed and translated.

tt6611916,"Review of Season One:KINGDOM is the second top-notch zombie production to come from South Korean, following the film TRAIN TO BUSAN. This one's a six-part Netflix miniseries that explores a zombie outbreak during the Joseon dynasty. The series is a strong mix of GAME OF THRONES-style political intrigue and plotting with plenty of zombie action; the zombies themselves are fresh and frightening, thanks to some twists with the mythology and 28 DAYS LATER-style speed and ferocity. Netflix have really gone to town with the production values here and many of the visuals are good enough to make framed prints. The scenery and sets look luxurious and the costumes are brought to life in glorious colours. A small but distinctive cast, including Doona Bae, play characters with depth and humanity. In between the zombie attacks there's endless plotting, twisting and oodles of suspense, while the stand-out set-pieces in episodes three and four are among the best I've ever seen. Needless to say, I can't wait for season two...Review of Season TwoThe second season is a slight step down from a first, but only a slight. The zombies only really pose a threat in half of the episodes and for the rest the new focus is on political intrigue, which is present times ten. I found some of the plotting to be slightly over-elaborate; the whole issue of the queen and her child was already fully explained in the first series, but seems to take up a lot of space here. Plus I always find flashbacks to be a slightly lazy way to pad out the story; GAME OF THRONES and BOARDWALK EMPIRE suffered from them too. Otherwise, there are still great production values, strong performances and expert choreography to enjoy, and a left-field twist at the climax ably sets up a very differently toned third season.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"Set in Korea's Joseon Period when, shortly after the king is taken ill, a mysterious plague starts to threaten the nation. The remains of a doctor who had died shortly after treating the king were eaten by starving peasants and shortly after they became ravenous zombie-like creatures, attacking anybody they see, spreading the condition. Crown Prince Lee Chang, the King's illegitimate son, starts to investigate. Rumours spread that the king is in fact dead and that the Queen's family is waiting for her to give birth; hoping if she has a son he will be the next king not the Crown Prince. When the Crown Prince is declared a traitor the army is deployed to find him.If you are a fan of zombies but feel most films/series are just more of the same these days this is a must see. Those infected by the plague might not follow all the standard zombie rules but the way they move at speed and as a mass adds to their scariness. These beings also are apparently unable to go out in the sun and seek shelter at night; this leads to tension rising as dawn approaches. The setting adds to the feeling that this series is something new; not just a different country but also an historical period that provides different problems to our own, notably the rigid hierarchy and palace scheming. The combination of court politics with zombies might seem an unusual mix but they work to give a great story. Everything looks great with beautiful scenery contrasting with the brutality of the action. The cast is solid, most notably Ju Ji-hoon, as the Crown Prince; Bae Doona as Seo-bi, a physician researching the plague; Kim Sung-kyu as Yeong-shin, a mysterious tiger hunter; and Kim Sang-ho as Mu-yeong, the Prince's bodyguard. The main plot lines are nicely wrapped up after two seasons but new details leave things open for a third; I have no idea whether there will be more though. Overall I'd say this is definitely one to watch.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"It hasn't been a mystery that South-Koreans can make very good movies but now Kingdom shows that they can also make quality shows as well. Kingdom is only two short seasons long (plus an additional long episode that came out in 2021 called Ashin From The North) but it's addictive to watch. The cinematography is just on top, and the acting for Asian standards is certainly not bad. Okay you have the occasional overacting from a couple actors but overal it's all very well done. Like Sang-ho Yeon's Busanhaeng (Train To Busan) the zombies are just something different than the usual thing we're used to. South-Korean zombies don't wander around slowly looking for brains like in American movies. Here they run like they are the next Usain Bolt and that what makes it suspenseful. The make-up is all very convincing, credits to the make-up artists for that. I binge watched the two seasons in a couple days followed by the extra long episode from 2021 which explains a lot in the end. You don't necessarily have to watch the extra episode but it's of the same quality and certainly worth watching. Kindom is another example why I love South-Korean cinema. They are the best from all Asian countries and that by far.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"I found this Korean zombie series better than walking dead. This series is like a Korean version of zombie in game of thrones. The zombie , story everything about this series is fresh. This series even likes to the non zombie lovers.
This series was a big surprise for me . I never expected it would be such good . They exicuted the series a large scale with limited budget. They keep 2 season with 6 episode each so there is not a wastage of single second. The graphics, action sequences, charectors, story were outstanding. I highly recommend to watch it . It would have been a great lose if you miss it.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"Really interesting combination of ideas. Fun new approach to zombies. I don't mind dubbing. The problem with this show is the characters are written to be pretty idiotic, with a few small exceptions most of the people are unbelievably dumb.

If your a fan of train to busan definitely check this series out its fantastically entertaining.4.5/5",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"I have some issues with this, but overall I really like it - it just keeps moving. The short run length of 6 episode for the first series is a breath of fresh air after drawn out shows like the marvel ones and umbrella academy.This was obvious in the second episode when our ""heroes"" needed to find someone and they were in the Frozen Valley - as soon as I heard that, I was prepared for a long drawn out journey to said Frozen Valley - but no - they were there in the next scene! This is very jarring compared to a US show that can draw out any event over several years, so it was refreshing to see a plot move along at pace.On the downside, I don't like my zombies to only come out at night and move quickly - the scary thing about zombies is while one is easily despatched through decapitation, they just keep coming and you are overwhelmed by slow moving numbers.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"A lot of fake accounts here which are rating the show, too bad. The series have great scenery, sets and costumes.

There was humor, but it was very subtle. The story has gotten quite intense. The characters are keeping me interested. The settings are beautiful and the music is stunning. I'm very much looking forward to more. My husband and I binged the first season in one night.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,"Netflix Kingdom is like a lot of Netflix shows.
It has huge production value, more so than most of Netflix shows.
The costume design, the practical effects and VFX for the zombies, all the details in Korean culture, the landscapes, the different colors et cetera. They all really feel like the show is taking you into that certain time.The first 6 episodes were also really good in action, when delivering so. Also the last episode had some really slithering tension and really great built up, leading to a cliff hanger. Don't really know what to think of that, but I'll take it for now.But it also falls for the same tropes of many Netflix original shows. First, it has some pacing issues. The 3 & 4th episode in particular feel practically only like retelling the second episode and in all these 3 episode the only thing happening is actually zombies killing people in villages. That leads to a dragging narrative for quite some time.The other flaw I had with it where the lacking characterization of many characters. While it looked gorgeous on the surface, the substance wasn't always there to back up. It certainly touched on themes like royalty, treason & honor, but it never gave its 3-4 characters at center much time to fully come to life.The acting & humor is very Asian-like, so you'd have to be prepared for some of these jokes, as the performances are very much like one would expect from a Korean production. But that's not really a flaw if you have your expectations.If you really don't care about much substance, or explained depth narrative than the show is absolutely perfect. It's zombie action, put into a unique setting, with unique ideas and themes.
I'm probably gonna check the second season out, so I'm curios what they are going to do after that cliffhanger.6-7/10",,"Action, Drama, Horror"

But by the 3rd episode the tone completely changed and it seemed like the show didn't take itself seriously anymore. I hated the bumbling buffoonery of some of the town leaders. The zombies became like all the B rated horror movies that we laugh at. It was cringe worthy and I couldn't stomach it. Very disappointing.
I might have to give it another try though.",negative,"Action, Drama, Horror"

Shocked that I'd watch a zombie TV show and by the end of the second season genuinely appraise it amongst my favorite dramas ever watched.Maybe I'm just a sucker for well-told horror-drama. Either way this is first and foremost an excellent show (that also happens to have zombies).I am wearily hoping that this show never abandons what makes it great or is cancelled by Netflix.Even more cynically hopeful that this story can begin, progress, and end without descending into late-stage failure.Either way it's worth a watch!",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"When I started watching this series I didn't know a great deal about it. I expected to be a a Korean drama with zombies set in the past and lots of sword fighting. I was not disappointed. It was exactly what I expected and a little bit more.First of all, I like the mythology of zombies in this series as they remind me of the traditional image (not the Hollywood version) of another monster whose name starts with v.Then after the first zombies appear, the court intrigues peaked my interest more so than the walking dead. Which mean there are more layers to the story and the suspense comes not only from the survival point of view but also form the character motivations. Another good point is that every episode is edited to perfection, there is no dragging along, no fluff to fill the time. The series is focusing on telling a story.Visually, it's top-notch, beautiful scenery and terrifying zombies. I'm hesitant to say it's historically accurate (well, because of the zombies) but I shook my head when I heard people want a strong female character in a period drama, just for the sake of modern trends. The old Korean society had strict hierarchy and the role of women was strictly domestic. Let's not start a dispute about depiction of history.I have 2 negative opinions about the first season of the series (as of writing the only one). First, the way it ended. Huge cliffhanger. Not a big complaint as the second season will come out this year, too. Second, another part of the ending. It wants to be a twist but it's unrealistic. I know I'm talking about realism in a zombie movie again but everything up to the last episode was perfect. Perfect explanation for everything and no obvious plot holes. It's bugging me that two consecutive nights are so different from one another.If you want to enjoy it, just watch it and be surprised at the plot twist, don't try to use physics to verify the possibility of some stuff. It's an amazing series. Way better than Walking Dead.",positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"

tt6611916,"This drama makes very effective use of suspense and these zombies are not at all sluggish, slow-moving, or entirely brainless. The biological explanations for dead humans running and trying to eat living humans seems pretty plausible. The only thing lacking is intimacy in the series--you don't really get to know any of the characters intimately, there isn't much character development, and relationships don't really evovle and develop. But in terms of a plot-driven storyline this drama does a great job. Sometimes the shock effects seem gratuitious and uncessary especially after the viewer is introduced to the zombies and have a good idea of how they operate. Scenes where a character is being stalked and pounced by these zombies during the last few episodes seem a little pointless. Suspense is really only exiciting when the predator is unknown and not well-understood. Otherwise, we can pretty much predict what the monster will do.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

Just the way papa likes it. rofl. They added a really nice twist to zombies in this series as well. I'm a fan for adding your own ideas and flare to how a zombie should act, but I had one hell of a grin on my face when.......oh, I guess you should watch the season finale and see what I was going to say?!The 1 and 2 star reviews don't seem to be zombie fans.

tt6611916,"This new Netflix original Korean zombie series succeeds in surprising with its fast paced narration and a few unexpected twists in a beaten to death genre.
This show takes a new approach by setting the zombie drama in the backdrop of a period show.
The politics of the monarchy forms the content of the screenplay. For the most part the zombie and political part of the show remains seperate but converges as it reaches the culmination point.
The variety of zombie deaths, the types of kills and the adreneline pumping chases are nothing short of great. It didnt hinder the experience in any way.
The locations this was set in,the aerial views and the scenic beauty captured via the lens provides an immersive experience.
The background scoring was good enough to capture and produce the thrill, especially during the final episode.The tone is really dark in this show. Apart from the zombie elements, the treachery and vile of the characters and their actions to protect power is diabolical at the least.The show does seem to slow down in its pace during the middle but compensates with its heart racing finale.The mini plots during the showcase of zombie disease spreading is done well without holding back in its disturbing level.Ultimately, this show is not a complete one and it never intended to be one. It sets up everything for a high potential second season. While doing this, it manages to surprise the viewers during the last episode.This is a short pacy zombie period show which does not demand much of your attention and can be binged as a casual view.PS: If you are new to Korean drama, the antics, goofs and few mannerisms of the actors may seem over the top, but it is sort of unique to the korean culture and is seen in every Korean movie and drama.

I used to watch the walking dead but the zombies became so slow and boring that I gave up on it. The zombies here are on a par with World War Z and then some, and just to make it more interesting they are also ever so slightly evolving through the show.

tt6611916,"Okay so first of all the comparison of 'kingdom' with 'the walking dead' and 'game of thrones' doesn't even make a single bit of sense. When any new show comes with the similar plot and storyline, it is always compared to the shows that are best in that particular genre. This is very ridiculous and stupid,stop doing it. Talking about 'the walking dead', that show is almost completed 150 episodes and has maintained the rating 8.2 even after season 7,8 being lowest rated of the entire series, still it's going strong with it's latest season 9,10 being entertaining again. And this show has 8.3 rating after just 17K votes. If ratings don't matter to y'all then also stop bragging senseless talk. And the comparison with GOT is out of the world. Take this show as a separate standalone show and then write about your opinion, but stop comparing two great shows with this show.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"
tt6611916,Do you remember watching the first season of the walking dead and being amazed at what they pulled off with that show? How lived in the world felt and how great the acting was? Then season 2 happened and it lost its magic. Well this is how I feel about kingdom. This show is amazing. I'm a huge South Korean cinema fan but I tend to stay away from their shows because they're usually just teen dramas but I heard this show was different and was planning on watching it but then I remembered how Netflix loved cancelling their originals so I held off on it. Now a few days away from the season 2 premier I decided to finally start watching this show and I watched all six episodes in one sitting. This show is so damn good and if you're a fan of zombies and/or South Korean cinema then you have to check this one out. It's the most revolutionary zombie property since the walking dead.,positive,"Action, Drama, Horror"

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIMEWhile season 1 was a great run, many are extremely disappointed with this highly anticipated sequel:
terribly slow pace, too much talkingfocused on political power struggle and drama with highly guessable plotswhere the fvck are the zombies????!!!!Looks like another TV series forced to finish deadlines in less than a year. Ended up producing a boring, pseudo-zombie show. Quite a mediocre season at best. Not worth wasting 6 hours of your life.

This wonderful zombie/political fantasy movie is brilliant. While I liked GoT, Kingdom is better. Excellent acting, top class manuscript, excellent effects, superior acting and all in all a marvelleus experience.Where GoT totally failed in the last two seasons this has logic, lives up to story and plot promises, while it is still subverting out expectations.The zombies are brilliantly conceived and they have the best explanation for their existence.

tt6611916,"Amazing. I'll admit, the start of the first of episode one I was not fully paying attention, and I'm not certain that was a bad thing as it only added to the mistery and intrigue. Upon the begining of Act II however, I had to shap to attention, I had to make sure I watched from the beginning of that act, and I found myself glued to the show from their, to the murky, frigid and deadly ends in this Midiæval political zombie mystery-thriller. What a ride! The cast was excellent and lived out their parts perfectly. The cinematography was breathtaking. The music was on key, or off key, in just the right fit for the feature.

tt6611916,"This series is great although, the one negative is the English dubbing / translations. I am confident that the Korean version isn't as silly or infantile as the translations would have you believe. In fact, the story and acting are enough to help you overlook the Anglo-slaughter of the dubbed version. I liked Ju Ji-Hoon's performance so much I googled him to see what else he was in so I could check them out.The reason for 7/10 is because there are a few moments throughout the seasons where the characters would have to be willingly stupid in order to not draw a straight line between what they've learned and uncovering secrets. I don't think a person of average intelligence wouldn't clue in to some things that characters in the show seem baffled by; again, this could be simply the result of poor translation, but that's the experience I had so it was hard not to be influenced by it.All in all, I am hopeful for future seasons and to see what happens to the Kingdom going forward.",neutral,"Action, Drama, Horror"

I love the back story with all its plot twists and turns, and the unique take on zombies. I found it very original and refreshing. There is so much more to the story than the usual zombie attacks in every scene, with their endless bone cracking and growling noises. There were one or two scenes where I found the acting to be a bit overdone and cheesy, but season 2 is phenomenal! I really enjoyed the depth the characters have developed.

It's funny, but after the first episode, you forget you're watching subtitles.This is incredibly well-written and well acted. It grabs your emotions and makes you invest in the characters. There's enough back story to explain things without it going off on to some uninteresting tangent. There is great chemistry between actors (not just the lead ones) and an amazing sense of anticipation. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, a twist comes in. Realistic twists, not some far-fetched thing to wrap up a side story.As soon as my phone pings, I'm on the tv to watch it full screen. I haven't felt such anticipation for a show in a very long time.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"So this kdrama is actually very dramatic and entertains throughout. Really loved the fl's character development and change in her personality as she slipped in her second life - it was super satisfying to watch. It's all fun until you see a lot of loose strings in the plot towards the end. Just to name a few points I didn't enjoy..1. Firstly I just didn't like the chemistry between the leads. Like don't want to shade the ml but he's just not good at acting. Where were his expressions excuse me? Nah they just didn't do it for me.2. Just don't understand why was the plot so non sensical after 12th ep. What's with all the murder scheming and stuff? And wtf was the point of pretending to get back with min hwang, like fr? So not needed. And Yoora and her actions were totally uncalled for.3. The writers did the second leads so bad like where was their screen time? They made such a cute pair. I really wanted to see them more instead of that crazy race of killing everyone.4. I know this is fiction and I have watched a lot of rich lead kdramas but still I always wonder do the characters have no real work to do? Like do they just scheme useless traps all day? Take yoora for example it just seemed like her full time job was to stalk ji won. Also how can you make a person hr head/ chairman's secretary/ lawyer at the same time lol. And even after that he has got time to dig everyone's dirt.Oh and did I mention I just couldn't take min hwang seriously the whole time?? Like it's not his fault it's just that I've seen him in welcome to waikiki before and I just can't seem to take him seriously ever again iykyk. The female casting was done perfectly - ji won, su min were all great choices and did a fabulous job. But not so sure about two male leads..Like the show is not that bad but if you are up for a typical kdrama that lacks sense here and there then just go for it.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Specially Lee Yi-kyung is not only good in his villainous acts but he was equally good in comedy scenes. Park Min-young does what she is famous for. Her acting is perfect.Na In-woo has wooden face but he is ok as lead as his only duty is to support FL. Good enough romantic scenes between leads.1st female villain, is good in dramatic scenes but she screamed a lot, which was annoying.In later episodes they bring another female vamp, which is not needed, she just increases the screen time.It's a soap opera type kdrama, good watch for kdrama lovers.Supporting cast is good.

tt26628595,"I've seen manhwa adoptions before (both with actors, as well as in animated form). Some better than others but when I stumbled over this one on my prime account, I dropped my viewing plans and cleared my schedule and watched the first 3 episodes (hours).I don't know if it's the score (music), the scrip (that looks like it holds hand in hand with its source (love that 👌) or if the actors, direction or lighting and stylist had a finger in making this magical. Perhaps all of the above because it just CLICKED for me. I got swept off into the story, it took me where I first went in the manhwa and I couldn't say any negatives about it,Sure, Su-min doesn't have her ""pink'ish"" hair, nor does a-hole of the year not his brown'ish hair but the actors ARE these characters. I have NO trouble believing them or notice who is who from a glance since the behavior (dirty or sweet) shines through everyone of the main cast.Deep respect for the actors here. Not sure if they read the manhwa and laughed, cried and raged at some characters and that's why they are so incredibly adjusted to just BE THEM! But everyone had me mimic their faces. I was so caught up in it! Sumin pouted and I wondered why my brows hurt: I was glaring at her while at the same time ""mirrored"" her pout because I was so deeply invested into it.When our heroine cried, feared or raged internally I ""felt"" all those emotions and was sobbing at several points, to the point that I had to apologize to the rest of the house that I just found a REALLY GOOD series, so that's why there is cheering, shouting and crying 😅Needless to say, I cannot speak highly enough for this.I know some will take issue with the lack of hair color on a few character, however I understand and have to respect the different culture of ""blending in"" rather than looking like a peacock in between shoots (or have horribly wigs that fans would perhaps also fault them for).",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

The script its so similar to the original one. I've been screaming like a crazy, getting mad, crying. And my heart can't wait to see the next episodes each week. The story is very shocking, and you can easily get into Jiwoon's life, understand her, and get encouraged with her, hoping that she can recover the life that she could live once before, being happy, and be loved.

There is no dragging or overextending of emotional moments, it feels like everything is moving just right.At the same time, I have to say I really dislike the tendency of kdramas to ""justify"" the main couple by throwing in flashbacks of how they've actually met before. Marry my husband joins other very good and prominent dramas with this cardinal cringy sin, which I completely dislike. I think it even takes away from the plot.Otherwise, I really like and feel inspired by the storyline of having the second chance to do your life all over- and I really like that the main character does a full makeover physically and mentally. She questions her own past actions and decides she is going to fight for herself. She chooses to no longer be a pushover, and tries finding people who deserve her. I think it's really fitting to have this drama released in this day and age.I heard it's a webtoon adaptation- I don't really know much about the webtoon so I can't comment on how well it was adapted.

It seems they are trying to drag the plot longer because the it was received well initially.The later writing really convinced me that the main character deserves to have a tragic life and die. It's all because of her terrible personality.Imagine someone gives up at the first sight of difficulty, refuse to listen to any explanation and deeply involved in her own beliefs and refuses to listen to any reasoning. Also makes audacious assumptions and don't even bother to prove if those assumptions are right or wrong. Hey I have an assumption and I'll just live by it. That's what her sounds like.It's horrible too watch at the later episodes.

But I see no oomph or pizzaz or badass attitude in her. Miscasting imo. For other characters i pretty much like them. This is just my opinion.

Ep 12 introduces the boss' ex, a vicious, ugly woman, who can't get over the fact she's not his ex-finace and of course, she plots lots of revenge. This character bored me to death, a waste of screen time. If your ex doesn't want you, what are you doing pursuing them, going behind their back doing these devious horrible things.

The positive and assertive action taken by FL definitely influenced all the good people around her, most especially the ML who is normally seen as boring, though he has all the money and power anyone will ever have.

I miss the days of them being so ridiculously stressful to watch I wanted to throw something. Think moments of legend of the deep blue.This drama had me hating the characters including the leads at times, the, liking them, then frustrated. The fact it evoked so much emotion seriously means a lot. Like let me re-iterate that I struggle through most dramas these days. I found it refreshing and honestly love the actors, although I'd say the ""villains"" are much much weaker than the leads. I also don't think some people realize that Dramas are basically leveled up Soaps. Seriously there's always going to be cheesy, soapy moments mixed in. That's just the nature of it.

His good looks and steady persona gave hope to the drama's declining romantic scenes. His presence kept me watching till the end. I usually like the main FC but - geez! Did she lose weight deliberately for this drama ? She looked too emaciated and terribly unattractive.

I saw her previous works, she was amazing, especially in ""Healer"", but unfortunately she didn't stop playing with her face, and that made her expressions frozen no matter how edgy she's.Na in woo, I love him, he's handsome and talented, but this role is not for him.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

Wanna see a slow burning love story with all the kdrama romance magic? Well then this is the drama for you! I absolutely loved it, even the makjang-esque parts of the plot. The secondary characters were also incredibly well written and were lovely in their own way getting their own full thought out stories.

tt26628595,I've been totally hooked since episode 1. I love everything about this drama. PMY and Na In-woo have a great chemistry. The supporting cast is great too and I'm glad to see Lee Gikwang make a return to acting after 6 years. He's one of the rare idols who can actually act. I've seen the 6 first episodes so far so I can only hope the quality of acting and realization will remain top notch with the next 10 episodes. I didn't read the webtoon and I'm happy to discover the story every week without any bias. The choice of PMY as MFL was a good idea. She shows fragility and strength beautifully.

tt26628595,"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2024 South Korean time travel, revenge romance with 16, 70 minute episodes.First I provide a unique synopsis then reviewSynopsisIn 2023 Kang Ji won (Park Min Young) is married to Park Min Hwan (Lee Yi Kyung) and is living a miserable life where she is emotionally abused by her husband his mother. Things worsen for her when she is diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. The one bright light in her life is her ""other half"", her childhood friend Jung Su min (Uhm Seo hyun). Or so she thinks. What remains of her life is completely shattered when she finds her husband and best friend in the midst of an affair. Even worse they are not remorseful and mock her poor condition. Things get physical between her and her husband and he winds up pushing her, in her weak state, into a glass table. As her life light dims, she hears her best friend and husband talking about life insurance and how she was just going to die anyway. She comes to finding herself having traveled back in time to before she married her murderous spouse (2013). Fate has given her the opportunity to change her life path and get revenge on those that wronged her. You want my husband? Well you can have him. She discovered she can change her fate by having key events transfer to someone else. And she cannot think of anyone who deserves her horrible husband more than her former best friend. Can Jiwon get revenge, change her fate and find love in the second chance?ReviewThis is an interesting and unique time travel romance. It ends happily. I would watch it again and recommend it to others. I read that Park Min young went on a very restricted diet to be even more thin for her role as a cancer patient and want to say she just, overall, did an outstanding job of portraying the role. I think she is a remarkable actress and I seek out series where she is in a lead role. Having seen Lee Yi Kyung in comedic roles, I was unsure he could play the sleazy, evil ex husband well, but he did an incredible job making the viewer loath the character.SpoilersI think it is a dramatically different experience watching this after having read the web novel and/or webtoon versus never having read either. It does follow the webtoon closely, which is good, but there are some deviations I do not think improved the story line or made it better adapted to a live show. I think they did it to add intrigue but, to me, the events from the webtoon were compelling enough.The things that were different from the comic to the webtoon:1. In the comic the Yoo Ji Hyuk (Na In woo), her former college classmate, who harbored an unrequited love for Jiwon, discovered her body after realizing she was missing from the hospital. He was so devastated by her death that he killed himself in the ocean. He didn't ever have a fiancé and Jiwon was his one true love. He always knew he loved her but stayed away because he thought she found happiness elsewhere and didn't want to interfere. That's why he made an effort to get closer to her when they regressed. He wasn't going to let her husband ruin her life again. In the live action version they chose to have him die in a car accident which, I felt, was less impactful.2. In the Webtoon version, the lady supervisor, who becomes a good friend of Jiwon, had a very different romantic story. In the Webtoon, Yang Juran's (Gong Min jeung) love interest was younger than her and had a fun, carefree personality. Because her married life was so difficult and she was so serious at work, it made sense for her to fall for the younger man. There was some moral conflict in the comic about whether it was okay to fall for him, but she lost out at the end. In the live action, Mrs. Yang's love interest is Lee Suk jun (Ha Do kwan) who is an austere, older executive who is unapproachable to most but shows a softer side to Mrs. Yang. It took out the whole Noona trope and added in a cold executive vibe which I did not feel was a good fit for a side romance.3. In the webtoon, Jiwon convinced Mrs. Yang to get tested for her stomach and that's how she found out early enough to fight the cancer. It became a plot hole, in the live version, when Mrs. Yang's cancer was not terminal like Jiwon's was in the Webtoon version. Yet, in the live version, Mrs. Yang caught the cancer early, without any intervention from Jiwon. That type of cancer is infrequently caught in the early stages so it made less sense for Mrs. Yang to catch it early all on her own.4. In the live action version, I didn't like how active of a role Jiwon had to take to take down Minwan and Sumin. In the scene where she catches them cheating, she gets in a physical altercation with Sumin and Minwan which makes it look like she was the aggressor and the push that wound up ending her life was just them fighting back harder than they should have. They did not highlight, in the live action, that she was still alive after she fell against the glass table and they did nothing to try to save her life. The moral ambiguity continued through the live action when Jumin was completely willing to let Sumin die in her place. In the comics, once Minwan and married, they continued to attack each other. They self destructed. Minwan's azoospermia took a more active role. After su-min ""lost"" her fake baby, the mom was a nightmare about conceiving and blaming her all the time. The home life was hell with the mom. She went to get fertility testing at the moms behest and demanded Minwan get tested too and that's how she found out. She brought it to the mom and the mom was so angry she had a stroke. In the webtoon , Sumin became her mother-in-law's sole caretaker and tormented her to get revenge for the way she was treated. But she was also was cruel to the mother-in-law after the stroke simply because she was not a very nice person as evidenced in the way she treated Jiwon when she had terminal cancer. Sumin's evil nature was further revealed in the Webtoon when she resolved to kill the mother-in-law by putting air in her IV line. There was a witness and she was caught and sent to prison. Meanwhile Minwan decided to get ride of Sumin for insurance money and cuts her brakes. He hears about his mom and rushes over, forgetting about the brakes and dies. Sumin then escapes from custody and tries to run over Jiwon with a car but Mr Yu jumps in front to save her and goes to the hospital. SuMin is captured again. In the webtoon, Sumin, the mother, and Minwan bring about their own destruction while the Jiwon and Jihyuk build their relationship and remain happy. I liked that the Webtoon did not make Jiwon actively steering events so that others died. Having them self destruct made her a much more heroic and sympathetic character.5. In the comics the characters weren't quite so intensely bound by the concept of ""transferring fate"". No one died by a coffee table again. Their actions had a real impact on the timeline and they weren't as helpless.6. There was no ex fiancé in the Webtoon. It was a huge cliche and caused way more drama than necessary. Oh Yu Ra (Kwon Bo ah or simply BoA) was a bland, stereotypical spoiled chaebol type with little dimension beyond ""she's just crazy"". It created a love triangle that was completely unnecessary to the plot.7. The twist that Mr Yu regressed as well was made way too early in the show. In the comic it was a last reveal, and done through a letter while Mr Yu was in the hospital. Jiwon learned everything he had done for her and how long he loved her and why he died before. Her father brought him back from death. He overcame his fate to be with her.8 The romance between the sister, Yoo Hui yeon (Choi Gyu-ri), and the chef, Baek Eun Ho (Lee Gi Kwang) was way cuter in the comics. They barely developed it in the show. She tried really hard to win his heart and he had lingering feelings for Jiwon but eventually came around. They shared a love of desserts.#ParkMinYoung#ChoiGyuri#LeeGiKwang#KwonBoAh#UhmSeohyun#LeeYiKyung#LeeGiKwang#MarryMyHusband.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Was highly looking forward to this series. Notwithstanding all the personal controversies surrounding Park Min Young, the drama started out with fantasy-suspense plot of a woman who's been given a miraculous second chance after suffering neglect and abuse by her two timing husband and manipulation by scheming bestie, and finally dying in their hands. Na In Woo plays the male lead and director (and hidden owner) of the company where Park Min Young's character works. He is miraculously given a second chance too and together the leads embark on a path to seek revenge and reclaim their lives through overturning their past fates. After some middling dramas, Na In Woo stands out here, and a veteran like Park Kin Young is great at creating chemistry. Together with the revenge plot and the suspense of how the leads' fate will chalk out this time around, the first 10-11 episodes are excellent and gripping. However, after that the drama degenerates into a soap with the two main antagonists appearing more and more deranged: therefore seeming like caricatures than real people. The introduction of a completely unnecessary character in the form of the male lead's ex-fiancée further boggles the plot. It seems that the writers couldn't figure out how to unravel the tangles once they had been created. The ex-fiancee is introduced as a plot device to solve some questions and is simply not a believable character. In the end, the storyline in the last few episodes makes all the villains look like comic book megalomaniac anti-heroes and the plot loses its credibility: despite the fantasy setting in the first place.Unrelated to the story, I couldn't help but notice: Several times in the episodes Park Ming Young's character is referred to as being 'all skin and bones', and she is that. If she is unwell and has lost weight that's another thing, but it's a totally unhealthy look and alarming to think that other girls may want to emulate her. I wish the producers had insisted on her gaining some weight before she signed on.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

tt26628595,"Production is good. Concept is good. Acting is not bad. Storyline is confusing. It's as if these people are written to make bad choices in life. I'm wondering if this is a cultural thing. I know many people who are invested in K dramas and would spend weeks and weeks watching episode after episode. They miss sleep to know what is next. And they all have one thing in common, they have this Mexican soap opera drama view of life. The reactions of the characters to incidents are very curious. This isn't a spoiler as it is the theme of this series, but the reaction to a close friend's betrayal is confounding. The people I know who are very into these k-dramas are also the same people who posts about self help memes on their social media. I wonder if there's a correlation?This is drawn out to the point where the scene is sooo thin that I wish they just get to it. The long drawn out gazes if taken out, probably would cut this series by half.The good thing is that the women are shown here as capable, talented and also conniving.These are my observations and frustrations trying to watch this for future topics of small talks. The thing is, clearly this formula works so while it is annoying to watch, I commend the show for being successful and able to reach the attention of those who that find this entertaining.

reminded me of a pantomime villian and I thought over-acted in the earlier episodes.The biggest disappointment was Na In-woo - he is very wooden and his face hardly changes. He is about to go into military

YOU HAVE A WHOLE SCRIPT WRITTEN AND DRAWN OUT FOR YOU! How in the world could you turn the webnovel so... boring? There are way too many pause moments and it skips so many important details like they're trying to lump the whole series into one season. The actors have little emotions and Sumins character is pitiful not spiteful. Jiwon turned into a strong woman that was more determined not... how to put this... dead like she's dying of cancer again.

That is refreshing.Is this frivolous?Yes, but it also poses philosophical questions related to destiny and the possibility of changing one's life.I am not a particular fan of K-dorama shows, but I must say that I enjoyed this very much, despite all the «buts» and «c'mons» that I usually object when I give a try to this type of series.

Jesus wants you to be victorious and not a victim....but as the world is losing Christ, people are falling more and more for victim morality where those claiming to protect are actually stealing your energy and sucking you dry.

It's my first time seeing Na In Woo but I also like his lowkey, near bored, expression. I think it suits the character well.Episode 10 is my favorite!! I love the satisfaction of seeing the villains get what they deserve, public humiliation at that! Wohoooo!I totally cracked up by the psycho best friend's reaction in the panties scenes. LOL.I seldom commend villains in a series but I think she did a great job in playing her character.One downside of this story that's why i'm giving it an 8 is there are too many bad and crazy people in it that it doesn't seem realistic anymore. It's just one after the other. Episode 12 is my least favorite when the ex-fiancé showed up. She's very unnecessary and her reasons for over the top revenge plot doesn't make sense at all, or at least justify everything she did.I like how they wrapped up the series for the main characters. It came to a full circle and you can't help but be happy for them. I also like how they show the connections from the future and the present scenes.Although I would say that their chemistry is just so-so - compared to the WWWSK tandem that will melt you.I would have loved to see the present development of Ms. Yang and Mr. Lee, though. As well as Eunho and Heeyeon (i love her bubbly self).Overall, this is a good watch and can be recommended.P. S. This is totally unrelated.

tt26628595,"Infidelity is the core of a story that is both the root of the personal conflicts and an everpresent issue among the characters. The good men are for the most part expensive clothes models and helping hands, always nearby and using muscle as needed. Narrative is a little extended, there was that choking episode that seems to have been a filler and some slower paced plotting in the early episodes, that whole campground sequence was stretched. Actress playing Soo-min the antagonist has some over-the-top scenes. Ji-Hyeok is a bland idealized boyfriend. Ji-won the protoganist has the largest character arc going from a sickly mouse to a rich and strong executive, some interesting writing has her going out of her way to aggravate her opponents. Everybody gets their just due, the meek and mild have learned to be more assertive and successful, others have funerals or incarceration. Direction uses a little too much of the K-Drama rewind technique, showing an event then following up with how it happened afterwards. Some sci-fi time travel aspects are dealt with, certain events have to occur but not neccesarily to the same individuals. 16 episodes wind up with a happy ending as a second-chance at life tale.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"

JiWon received a new chance to live and we also have these chances every day to change, to seek to be happy, to analyze the people who are by our side and seek the best for us.

tt26628595,"I always like Park Min Young shows and her sweetness radiates here. She has always been good at looking sad too. But she lost too much weight for this role and it was not really necessary for the story to be that thin. It does make one sympathetic towards her sick character. She does showcase many lovely outfits. Fashion is quite a part of this show and both her and her tall co star Na In Woo have hair and wardrobe makeovers and lose their glasses. Superficial but lots of fun how they transform quite a lot from their ill fitting outfits to the latest dresses and sharp suits. The most interesting characters are the villainous couple Lee Yi Kyeong is the comic relief. Talented musical actor as well. Song Ha Yoon plays the toxic friend who is just so jealous and obsessive. Seems over the top but there are people like that in real life. Her character is quite realistic and subtle at first. She is a villain that will go down in K drama history as a memorably insane woman.The story has a very similar premise to the recently series Perfect Marriage Revenge with the murder and going back in time. But this show is better. Things do move quite quickly from her murdered 2023 timeline to the 2013 second chance time. She then proceeds to fix things and it is fun to see her getting strong and the villainous couple getting their comeuppance. Ep9 and 10 are quite feel good. But there is some drag in the pace before they do. Then another murderous villain comes in played by BoA who is quite unpleasant to watch. Should have stuck to singing. They carefully plot to change their fate to the other couple and the director clearly differentiates what happened before and what is happening now. Still, if some plot digressions had been cut and the series was just 12 episodes instead of 16, this would have been a better show. The ending completely and thoroughly gives closure to all the characters with a nice big happy conclusion wedding babies and all. Not like some rushed ending series.

tt26628595,"Marry My Husband centers around an ill woman who receives the final blow when she learns her bestie and husband are having an affair. She dies soon after, but is given a second chance at life.Marry My Husband makes it easy to fall in love with protagonist Kang Ji-won - and that's already half the battle won for this K-drama. Park Min-young effortlessly portrays her as smart and kind, though not in a superficial way, but a little too naive and trusting. Yet, she's learning from her past (or, in this case, future) mistakes and evolving as a person. Thankfully, it's a gradual process that allows the audience space to root for Ji-won as the show progresses, while acknowledging that she can't possibly handle it all on her own.To that end, Ji-won is surrounded by a cast of equally charming, if fairly one-dimensional, characters. There's her bubbly co-worker Yu Hee-yeon (Choi Gyu-ri), who gives Ji-won a makeover, well-meaning but meek assistant manager Yang Joo-ran (Gong Min-jung) and her stoic but secretly soft-hearted boss and love interest Yu Ji-hyuk (Na In-woo). They are as tropey and archetypal as K-drama characters come, but in a way that's also their job, to not detract from who we're all here for: Kang Ji-won. It may not be the most groundbreaking of shows, but that's not what it's trying to be either. This Korean drama knows it's a guilty pleasure through and through, and embraces that wholeheartedly. There is something immensely satisfying about seeing a carefully drawn-out, deliciously manipulative revenge plan slowly but steadily unfold onscreen. It satisfies by giving the audience exactly what they want by letting Ji-won get her payback, with a handful of unexpected twists that are just enough to keep viewers running back for more.My Rating : 8.4/10.",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"The short answer is yes, the long answer is no.The WEBTOON of ""Marry My Husband"" has a combined total of 69 episodes including the spins offs. Fitting 58 episodes of the main story into just 16 TV episodes obviously isn't going to do the story full justice, but I'll give this series a 10 anyway.The main difference is the pacing, as you could expect. I felt like a lot of the plot points were miss timed, or that they were shortened or lengthened compared to the webcomic. I'll be comparing most of this show to the comic... since that's what it was based on.From my memory, Eun-ho didn't have as much of a significant plot as he did in the show. He ran a cafe, not a restaurant, then left the country for a while and wasn't seen in the comic until near the end. Ji-Hyuk also didn't really interfere with Ji-won's plans and life after returning to 2013, he trusted her enough to know what was going to happen to handle a lot of the issues herself-this Ji-Hyuk in the show is much more overbearing. Yu-ra, from what I recall, was not as big of a plot point as she was made out in the show. I don't believe she came back as a vengeful ex-fiancé, if I'm remembering right she and Ji-won ended up on good terms; but I could be miss-remembering. She also doesn't kill Ji-won's mom, I do believe that Ji-Hyuk paid Ji-won's mom not to bother her again. Ji-hyuk didn't die in a car accident, in the webcomic he was so distraught after Ji-won's death-which I believe he whitenesses-that he ended up taking his own life; Min-hwan's death later ends up mirroring that, Min-hwan takes Ji-hyuk's fate. Ji-won doesn't change immediately like in the show, it was gradual and she wasn't as instantly opposed to Sumin; she had her head on straight and was more into playing the long game. She was better at concealing her emotions. Also in the webcomic the taxi driver, Ji-won's dad, gives her a candy not money, and Ji-hyuk never got that weird heart tattoo. Miss Yang's plot was accurate if not a little looked over, she had a lot more going on that she did in the show.Separating the show from the webcomic however, it was great! I loved it. But you do need to think of them as two separate entities. Unlike some book to movie adaptations, say Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings, which try to stay as accurate as possible to the story, this is not. It's good, it's just not an accurate comparison. I personally always enjoy the book more when it comes to BTM adaptations, but that's because you can build so much more character and world into the story with the time allotted. You can't do that with a show. This show does really good with taking the plot points and molding them into what they needed to be a TV show, this story could have only been a TV show, a movie wouldn't have done it justice.I really enjoyed it, thee really isn't anything I would change except for Ji-hyuk's death. He didn't seem desperate enough in the show, which is what I think the comic did really well. Ji-hyuk's emotions were more deeply explored in the webcomic, in the show he felt very flat or one note. His entire personality was Ji-won, whether she wanted him to or not, and I think that's unfair to both characters.Sumin's end could have been dealt with better, for some reason I feel like she broke out of prison at one point, but I could be mixing my comics together. This is such a common trope in WEBTOON that it's hard to keep them straight, ""There Must Be a Happy Ending"" is another comic very, very similar to this one. But out of all the webcomics like this that I've read I'm glad that it was this one that was made into a show. It's gotten so much love and I'm glad the author had gotten their flowers.If you're trying to get into K-Dramas, or maybe want to get into webcomics, this is a good start. I hope they come out with more webcomic to move adaptations. ""True Beauty"" is another one, but that story was never as good as this, so I didn't watch is all the way through. I'm just pleased to see that webcomics are getting more recognition!",neutral,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"I concluded the whole show in only 2 days, i had to kept in my couch and watch the following over and over. I loved all the acting, really got engaged with the mean ones and wished the best for the others lol. This is one of those shows where you don't know what to do next in your life after watching them. It was my first dorama and really me got me into these, now im looking for others but thinking nothing will make me feel the same I did with this show. You won't regret it, it's an emotion roller coaster throughout the whole...
I give it a 10/10, because the execution was awesome, it's really an art.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"First, let me say that I really liked this show. My criticisms are intended to point out why it didn't get my highest rating. If you like soap suds with your dramas, this is a perfect fit. On that end, my complaint is that it became too sudsy near the end, where bad people turned into virtual cartoon characters of real people. In my view, a good sudsy drama has to stay a little farther from the line or its impact is lost. Once the former fiancée of the male lead enters the picture, it starts getting way too over the top. Still worth watching, just too much. The female lead shines, as always, just like she did in Ms. Kim, although I think she's gotten a bit too thin. The one who continues to impress is the female assistant manager who I have seen elsewhere. This actress has quite a range. The lead female villain plays the role in the only way it makes sense, a true psychopath. The former fiancé I found a bit bland, but, that is partly a result of dull writing which relied too much on plot events for her. Her dialogue deserved more snap. The other actors and actresses did there jobs, but this is not supposed to be so long. Nonetheless, a definite thumbs up.",positive,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"ML and FL scenes together are so bland and fake that you really have to think of something else just to make it trough, or fast forward. These two actors REALLY don't have a feeling for each other. If I think back on secretary Kim and sizzle that relationship was!The girl villain in the story has to rely on screaming and screeching to portray her evilness.. probably not the fault of the actress in this case, but how she is directed. The story only picks up when the evil doing ramps up, that's just not how a drama should grab your attention. There is no real character growth, not twist that is interesting in any way..
well ... blah. I have loved Park Min Young since secretary Kim, but now it feels like she is just going through the moves for the pay check. Pity.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"I know only 6 episodes are out right now but honestly, I think I can already tell how the story is going to go.I read the manhwa and the manhwa was great! The storyline was enticing, interesting, and easy to digest. It went straight to the point, didn't have any unnecessary fluff and it was easy to follow and the plot twists was thrilling.I was super excited for the adaptation but I am disappointed. I thought it would follow closely to the manhwa but it didn't which made the episodes dull, boring, and un-organized. So far, it's giving ""Strong Woman. Do Bong Soon"" where some of the characters were 2 dimensional, the plot didn't make sense or at least the scenes leading up was anti-climatic, and the flow wasn't flowing. That's exactly what's happening to Marry my Husband. Like I need more revenge. They should have just done 12 episodes instead of 16.Some of the actors that were chosen were okay, they could have done better with the casting because the chemistry was barely there for the two leads. I think I am going to drop it and just re-read the manhwa.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"I love Kdrama, but this one is unfortunately weak, slow, dull, the plot drags and the actors are excellent in a terrible dramatization. I watched until episode 9 hoping the plot would improve, unfortunately it didn't happen, the episodes continued to be boring and dull. It will be impossible to watch until the last episode, sixteen in total at this rate it becomes tiring in this search for revenge. It lacks action, determination, pulse, it lacks a little comedy, it lacks joy. This kdrama is one of the weakest I've watched and followed until now. It's a shame that this is the case, because Koreans are great at making drama.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"The script and the acting are just embarrassing. It feels like some soap opera written and played by some kids.I most be honest, I'm an European, i don't know much about asian cultures but is hard for me to believe is possible in reality for people to act so stupid and spoiled as in this movie.Also I can't understand how the rating is so big. How can some people watch this and say is brilliant? Is this the first movie they ever seen? Had they seen human behaviour before this movie?....This movie remembered be my the time when I heard 'Cinderella' story first time when I was kid and feeling that the behaviour of the family is very poorly written.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"As many other kdramas before,this one started very excitng and makes you anticipating eagerly what will happen next. But that very soon turns into ""what the hell am I watching here and why?""""Marry my husband"" has a female lead who suffered her whole life. Almost everything bad that could happen,it happened to her. And it just never stops! We know that the Korean dramas makers are keen to exaggeration but my God,did they overdid this time haha.Like it wasn't enough that female lead is dying from the cancer and married to a guy who mistreats her and mentally abuses her,used her as a source of money so he doesn't have to work,she has mother in law who is absolutely unbearable and humiliates her in every way possible and makes her feel like a worthless piece of cr*p all while her husbund is cheating on her with her sly,manipulative,evil ""best friend"" who hates her the most as it seems but keeps our female lead delusional and with fake sense of friendship and ""sisterhood"".Noo,all this wasn't enough so there is a female lead's mother who emerged so that she can conspire with all those people I described above to kill her daughter she hasn't seen 15 years and take all of the money that she was given by the unbelievably unreal male lead,aka ""prince charming"".Throughout all the series the creators showed us that everyone who came across the female lead's path hates her and treats her as she isn't worthy of any decency but of course there is a perfect prince charming who gives everything for her. She even ends up winning over his ridiculusy rich and grumpy grandpa to adore her and she ends up being the richest and respected woman in S. Korea.Her mother despised her,her husband,his mother,her best friend,everyone in school,her superior at work...but there is a perfectly nice,handsome,insanely rich guy who fell in love with her and made her life a fairiy tale.If I wanted to see stuff like that,I'd watch cindarella or sleeping beauty or beauty and the beast. I'm seriously gonna reconsider my upcoming kdrama list cause they keep getting worse and worse.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"I, as an ordinary viewer, will only talk about my emotions. The main character was so carried away by revenge that in the second part of the drama she became a negative hero for me. A good person cannot insult, humiliate, force to kill, and so on, so much, no matter how much he has suffered before. And at the end, their happy life, wedding, children generally looked like a dance on bones and personally did not give me any positive emotions. The most appropriate couple in this drama was the main character's sister and the chef. In second place I have a couple of ""villains"", and in last place are a couple of main characters with their happy ending.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Couldn't even survive the first episode...senseless, expressionless...the kdrama magic is missing in this one!I don't understand why would a working woman have a relationship with a married, jobless man and not just any man...her best friend's husband....And also I don't understand why did the female lead endured such cruelty from her husband and mother in law after her marriage...now a days no female stands for such behaviour...and if they do...then they shouldn't.Well, where was I...? Yes the character showcasing...it's understandable that after going back to the past suddenly made FL clumsy...but why was there only one person saving her again and again in the time span of few minutes? Waaaaay cheesy for a kdrama...",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"If you've read the manhwa then surely you'll agree that the storyline ,plot etc was much better and interesting than the series ...personally I'm disappointed...it's like only a few basic pieces of the plot were kept and the rest was just whatever they wanted it to be I guess ..not even the ending is accurate. Im aware a lot of adaptations tend to not follow the plot but as a big fan of the manhwa I was so excited to see that it was getting a series and this is what I get ...I'm literally so sad about how it turned out ...also only 16 episodes ?! For what ?I guess they must've had issues with budgeting.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
tt26628595,"Marry my husband A fantasy, time travel, romance, betrayal drama. Which is a copy of perfect marriage revenge drama. Both are same concept with different character and little bit different storyline. To be very honest the concept is really interesting but the character of the story is not interesting that much.Park min young is really a amazing actress but she need to choose some good drama she has to come out from her comfort zone. Seeing her same kind of character is now irritating. Both leads doesn't have a chemistry. I mean their character is also not likable.I feel this drama is hyped because of her controversy!I don't understand why did she loose the weight for one two scenes such a stupid decision from her side. She looks so bad in whole series.",negative,"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"
